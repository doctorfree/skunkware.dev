<P>Squid Web Proxy Server is a free, high-speed Internet proxy-caching program that works with a web server to allow users fast access to cached Internet and Intranet pages.  Most firewall proxies do not store copies of Internet data returned to a user, but refetch the information each time it is requested.  By caching previously requested pages, Squid can reduce the time to serve Internet and Intranet information to users and save valuable networking bandwidth.  Squid also offers features such as Transparent Caching and Acceleration.  See the Squid User's Guide at <A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/Users-Guide">http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/Users-Guide</A> for more information.
<P>The following notes apply only to the supported Squid web proxy server Release 2.3STABLE2 installed from the Skunkware 2000 CD on OpenServer 5.0 systems.

Installing Squid</H3>
<P>
To install Squid, use <B>custom</B>(ADM).
<P>See your OpenServer 5.0 documentation for details.
<A NAME="upgrading"></A>
<H3>Previous installations</H3>
The Open Server Release 
5 Squid installed from Skunkware 2000 is not upgradeable from any previously installed Skunkware Squid package.  Installation will overwrite any existing, previously installed Open Server 5 Squid software.  If you have a previous version of the Open Server 5 Squid package installed it is recommended that you make a backup of it before installing this newer version.
<P>
The Skunkware Squid conflicts directly with any previously installed versions of Squid from Open Server Release 5 Optional Services 'squid' packages, or from the Open Source Squid organization web site.  If the Open Server Release 5 Optional Services of Open Source Squid is installed, it must be removed before installing the Skunkware 2000 Squid package. Before removing the Skunkware or Open Source Squid package, it is recommended that you make a backup of it before installing this version of the software. 
<BR>
<A NAME="starting"></A>
<H3>Starting Squid</H3>
To enable and start Squid, use the /etc/squid script:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>/etc/squid enable</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Options accepted by /etc/squid include start, stop, enable, disable, query, restart, and rotate.  See Squid(1M) man page for details.
<A NAME="removing"></A>
<H3>
Removing Squid</H3>
To remove a layered product or patch, use <B>custom</B>(ADM).
<P>See your OpenServer 5.0 documentation for details.
<BR><A NAME="addconfig"></A>
<H2>Additional Configuration</H2>
Squid installed from Skunkware 2000 by default configures itself for immediate use.  Following are some additional configuration options which you may choose to employ.
<BR>
Configuration changes should be make in 
<BLOCKQUOTE>/usr/local/squid/etc/squid.conf</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><B> IMPORTANT NOTE:</B></H3>
If the server is running, it will need to be restarted before any changes can take effect.
<BL>
By default, Squid uses 100M of disk space for storing cached documents.  On a dedicated proxy server, this value is likely to be too small.  The appropriate value to change is "cache_dir".  See the configuration file for details.  After changing this value, it is necessary to recreate the cache directories using the -z switch before starting Squid:
<NL><BLOCKQUOTE> /usr/local/squid/bin/squid -z
<BR>
 /etc/squid start
</BLOCKQUOTE></NL>
<BR>
By default, Squid uses 8M of RAM for storing "hot" (very popular) replies.  One a dedicated proxy server, this value is likely to be too small.  the appropriate value to change is "cache_mem".
<BR>
By default, acls (access control lists) prevent users from connecting to the proxy server, with the exception of localhost.  In order to allow access to others, it will be necessary to add an acl for the appropriate users.  Information on creating acls as well as examples of acls may be found in the acl section of the User's Guide.
<BR>
By default, Squid error messages are in the same language as the installed machine's locale.  In order to change the language of the Squid error messages, simply change the symbolic link <BLOCKQUOTE>/usr/local/squid/etc/errors</BLOCKQUOTE> to point to the appropriate directory in <BLOCKQUOTE>/usr/local/squid/etc/locale.</BLOCKQUOTE>
