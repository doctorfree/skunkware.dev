NAME
<dd>
proc - print information about a live process or core image
<dt>
SYNOPSIS
<dd>
<code>proc -[fhms] [-l</code> <i>lwpid</i><code>] </code><i>corefile</i><code>|</code><i>pid</i><code>|</code><i>procpath</i>
<dt>
DESCRIPTION
<dd>
<code>proc</code> prints out information about the current state of a
live process or about the state of a process at the time
at which it generated a core image.  The output can
include information that is global to the entire process
or information for one or more light-weight processes.
A light-weight process is specified with the <code>-l</code>
option, which takes as an argument an LWP id.  Multiple
<code>-l</code> options may be specified for each invocation.
If no LWP ids are specified, 
<code>proc</code> will print out status information
for the process.
<p>
<i>corefile</i> is the file name of a core image generated
by a process due to a signal or as the result of an
invocation of <code>gcore</code>(1). 
<p>
<i>pid</i> is a process id for a live process.  <i>procpath</i>
is the pathname of a directory entry for a live process
under <code>/proc</code> (see <code>proc</code>(4)).  
In either case, <code>proc</code> attempts to gain control of the process. 
<code>proc</code>, by default, does not
attempt to halt a running process when printing information
about its status.  This can mean that information about multiple
LWPs can have been retrieved at slightly different points in the
process' lifetime.  To ensure consistency of information,
you can request that <code>proc</code> temporarily halt the process
by specifying the <code>-h</code> option.  The process will be
resumed when <code>proc</code> exits.
<p>
The type of information printed by <code>proc</code> can be controlled
using one or more of the following options:
<dl>
<dt>
<code>-f</code>
<dd>
Full listing; <code>proc</code> prints process or LWP level status
information.  For the process level, this information includes
the base name component of the exec'd program name and
the first part of the argument list to the process (limited
to <code>PSARGSZ</code> characters, defined in <code>&lt;sys/procfs.h&gt;</code>).
The full listing for processes also includes information
about the current signal, if the process has received
a signal; process identifiers (process id, parent process id,
process group id and session id); owner identifiers
(effective, real and saved user and group ids as well
as supplementary group ids); any pending signals;
process status flags; the number of LWPs in the process;
the size of the process; the controlling terminal; 
the starting time of the process; and process elapsed
timing information.
<p>
For LWPs the full listing includes information about the
current signal, if the LWP has received a signal;
any pending or held signals; information about the last system
call made; state of the LWP; scheduling and processor bind
information; and the contents of the LWP's processor registers.
<dt>
<code>-m</code>
<dd>
<code>proc</code> prints a memory map for the process. 
For each segment this information includes the virtual address range,
the size of the memory image, the memory protections
and the object file (if any) from which the segment was
mapped or the type of the segment for certain special
segments (<code>STACK</code> or <code>BREAK</code>).  For live processes,
if the segment was memory mapped from a file, the file offset
is provided.  For core images, both a memory size and a file
size are provided.  The file size is zero if the contents of
the segment were not actually dumped to the core file.
Core images may also contain segments of type <code>NOTE</code>.
These represent the status and context information added
to a core file by the system and are not part of the process
image.
<dt>
<code>-s</code>
<dd>
Short listing (default).
<code>proc</code> prints a subset of the process or LWP level information
provided by the full listing.
