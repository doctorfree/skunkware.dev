In the beginning it was just me but soon there were many contributors
to Skunkware not only fellow workers in Santa Cruz but folks from
Canada and Europe and Mexico and Australia and all over were
pitching in with ports and tools and documentation and graphics.
It was pretty cool and everybody really enjoyed working on Skunkware.

Here is a [list of Skunkware contributors](https://skunkware.dev/2000/credits.html)
from the Skunkware 2000 release. There were many more contributors so
[let me know](mailto:skunkware@ronrecord.com) if you're not on the list but want to be.
