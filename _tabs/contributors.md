In the beginning it was just me but soon there were many contributors
to Skunkware not only fellow workers in Santa Cruz but folks from
Canada and Europe and Mexico and Australia and all over were
pitching in with ports and tools and documentation and graphics.
It was pretty cool and everybody really enjoyed working on Skunkware.
