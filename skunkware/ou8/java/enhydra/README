I've repackaged Enhydra and the Java Foundation Classes in
custom installable format for OpenServer. Enhydra requires
Swing, so download both current releases for OpenServer:

    enhydra-3.0.1-VOLS.tar and swing-1.1-VOLS.tar

You must also, of course, have installed the JDK.

To test, after installing:

   cd /usr/local/enhydra/demos
   ./start

and point a browser at http://your.server.name:9050
