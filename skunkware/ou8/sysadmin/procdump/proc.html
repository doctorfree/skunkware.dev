<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>proc</STRONG> prints out information about the current state  of  a
       live  process  or about the state of a process at the time
       at which it  generated  a  core  image.   The  output  can
       include  information  that is global to the entire process
       or information for one or more light-weight processes.   A
       light-weight  process  is  specified  with  the <STRONG>-l</STRONG> option,
       which takes as an argument an LWP id.  Multiple <STRONG>-l</STRONG> options
       may  be  specified for each invocation.  If no LWP ids are
       specified, <STRONG>proc</STRONG> will print out status information for  the
       process.

       <EM>corefile</EM>  is  the file name of a core image generated by a
       process due to a signal or as the result of an  invocation
       of <STRONG>gcore</STRONG>(1).

       <EM>pid</EM>  is  a process id for a live process.  <EM>procpath</EM> is the
       pathname of a directory entry for  a  live  process  under
       <STRONG>/proc</STRONG>  (see  <STRONG>proc</STRONG>(4)).   In  either case, <STRONG>proc</STRONG> attempts to
       gain control of the process.  <STRONG>proc</STRONG>, by default,  does  not
       attempt  to  halt a running process when printing informa-
       tion about its status.  This  can  mean  that  information
       about  multiple  LWPs  can have been retrieved at slightly
       different points in the process' lifetime.  To ensure con-
       sistency  of  information,  you can request that <STRONG>proc</STRONG> tem-
       porarily halt the process by  specifying  the  <STRONG>-h</STRONG>  option.
       The process will be resumed when <STRONG>proc</STRONG> exits.

       The  type of information printed by <STRONG>proc</STRONG> can be controlled
       using one or more of the following options:

              <STRONG>-f</STRONG>     Full listing; <STRONG>proc</STRONG>  prints  process  or  LWP
                     level  status  information.  For the process
                     level, this information  includes  the  base
                     name  component  of  the exec'd program name
                     and the first part of the argument  list  to
                     the  process (limited to <STRONG>PSARGSZ</STRONG> characters,
                     defined in <EM>&lt;</EM><STRONG>sys/procfs.h</STRONG><EM>&gt;</EM>).  The full  list-
                     ing  for processes also includes information
                     about the current signal, if the process has
                     received a signal; process identifiers (pro-
                     cess id, parent process id, process group id
                     and  session  id); owner identifiers (effec-
                     tive, real and saved user and group  ids  as
                     well  as supplementary group ids); any pend-
                     ing signals; process status flags; the  num-
                     starting  time  of  the process; and process
                     elapsed timing information.

                     For LWPs the full listing includes  informa-
                     tion  about  the  current signal, if the LWP
                     has received a signal; any pending  or  held
                     signals;  information  about the last system
                     call made; state of the LWP; scheduling  and
                     processor bind information; and the contents
                     of the LWP's processor registers.

              <STRONG>-m</STRONG>     <STRONG>proc</STRONG> prints a memory map  for  the  process.
                     For  each  segment this information includes
                     the virtual address range, the size  of  the
                     memory image, the memory protections and the
                     object file (if any) from which the  segment
                     was  mapped  or  the type of the segment for
                     certain special segments (<STRONG>STACK</STRONG>  or  <STRONG>BREAK</STRONG>).
                     For  live processes, if the segment was mem-
                     ory mapped from a file, the file  offset  is
                     provided.   For  core  images, both a memory
                     size and a file size are provided.  The file
                     size  is zero if the contents of the segment
                     were not actually dumped to the  core  file.
                     Core  images  may  also  contain segments of
                     type <STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>.  These represent the  status  and
                     context  information added to a core file by
                     the system and are not part of  the  process
                     image.

              <STRONG>-s</STRONG>     Short listing (default).  <STRONG>proc</STRONG> prints a sub-
                     set of the process or LWP level  information
                     provided by the full listing.
