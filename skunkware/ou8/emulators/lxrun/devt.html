Current areas of development</A> in lxrun
<P>
Since lxrun is fairly robust now, implementation of new system
calls has slowed down quite a bit.  However, there are lots of
other aspects of lxrun that need work.  If you'd like to help
with any of the following efforts, contact the people involved
or E-Mail

	<DT> <STRONG>March 1998: Incorporating SCO and SUN changes </STRONG> 
	<DD> SCO has done some work on lxrun to support UnixWare 7 and Sun
has done the same for Solaris7 x86. Current effort is to merge these changes 
back into the current release (0.9.1pre3) and release a new version 
(probably 0.9.3since the SCO release for UnixWare7 was numbered 0.9.2sco1)

 <LI> <STRONG>ld-linux.so port to OSR5/UW2/UW7 --</STRONG>
	By making a native ld-linux.so, there would no longer be a need
	to execute lxrun explicitly -- the user could just run the Linux(R)	
	app as if it were a native app.  This is important to the seamless
	integration of Linux apps into the SCO environments.
	<BR><STRONG> This has been completed for the Solaris and UnixWare7
	platforms (ELF binaries only) </STRONG>

 <LI> <STRONG>installation of lxrun --</STRONG>
	Right now it's a major pain to install lxrun.  Various files
	have to be downloaded and installed in various places.  This
	process needs to be automated.
	<BR> <STRONG> This is still a concern - currently its being addressed
	by distributing a comprehensive set of linux libs and files to make a 
	linux runtime environment and providing Installation Notes for 
	application (suites) that require more than copying a binary into place.	This is necessary but insufficient </STRONG>

 <LI> <STRONG>Solaris x86 port & autoconf support --</STRONG>
	Since the purpose of lxrun is to promote the free exchange
	of software between systems, the more systems on which it
	runs, the better.  Andrew Gallatin successfully ported lxrun
	v0.8.6 to Solaris.  Work is currently under way to re-port
	the current version of lxrun to Solaris, and also to make
	lxrun's adaptation to the host system more robust using
	GNU autoconf.
	<BR> <STRONG> Support for the Solaris version is continuing at Sun
	We've backed off on supporting autoconf given the small number off
	platforms we're currently suporting </STRONG>
	<ADDRESS>(James Macnicol)</ADDRESS>

 <LI> <STRONG>shared memory X11 --</STRONG>
	Currently, all X applications that run under lxrun do so via
	TCP/ip.  This is because the shared memory scheme that Linux
	uses for local communication between X apps and the X server
	is incompatible with SCO's X servers.  If we could devise a
	way to bridge this gap, performance on lxrunned X apps would
	improve dramatically.
