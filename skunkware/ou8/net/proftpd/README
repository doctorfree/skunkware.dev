ProFTPD is configured by default to run out of inetd. In order to run 
ProFTPD you will need to edit /etc/inetd.conf. Replace the line:

ftp  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/sbin/in.ftpd  in.ftpd -a

with the line:

ftp  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/local/sbin/proftpd  /usr/local/sbin/proftpd

or, to use TCP wrappers, replace the line:

ftp  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/sbin/in.tcpd  in.ftpd -a

with the line:

ftp  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/sbin/in.tcpd  /usr/local/sbin/proftpd

After editing /etc/inetd.conf you will neet to restart inetd. This can be
accomplished by determining the inetd process id using ps and then sending
the HUP signal to that process using the kill command:

   # ps -ef | grep inetd
   # kill -1 <pid>

where <pid> is the process id of inetd.

Due to security considerations, you may need to use passive mode
when establishing an FTP connection. Most FTP clients provide an easy method
of specifying passive mode. The native ftp client on UnixWare 7 accepts a
"-p" switch (e.g. ftp -p ...).

I found that on a freshly installed UnixWare 7.1.1 system, in order to setup
an anonymous FTP directory, it was necessary to copy the following files
and devices into the anonymous FTP root:

    dev/tcp (mknod tcp c 7 37)
    dev/zero (mknod zero c 39 1)
    etc/netconfig
    etc/inet/pipeline
    usr/lib/libc.so.1
    usr/lib/libsocket.so.1
    usr/lib/libsocket.so
    usr/lib/libsocket.so.2
    usr/lib/libnsl.so
    usr/lib/libnsl.so.1
    usr/lib/libresolv.so
    usr/lib/libresolv.so.1
    usr/lib/libresolv.so.2

You may also need to add the ftp user's shell (e.g. /bin/true) to /etc/shells.
Additional configuration information is available in the ProFTPD documentation,
man pages, source directory and on-line at either:
