With this release of KDE for UnixWare 7 (KDE 1.1) i have provided both a
complete pkgadd installable datastream (kde-1.1.pkg) as well as smaller
components (base KDE, KDE games and the remaining KDE files). This will
hopefully help the less well-connected download KDE.

So, you can download either the whole package:

    kde-1.1.pkg      (77127680 bytes)

or the following:

    kdebase-1.1.pkg  (39910912 bytes)
    kdegames-1.1.pkg ( 8381952 bytes)
    kderest-1.1.pkg  (28908544 bytes)

All that is really necessary to run KDE is the base package. However, lots
of useful and/or groovy stuff is in the other two packages.
