The following is the Readme included with the XForms 0.89 distribution.
This is the first release of a binary distribution of XForms for UnixWare 7.
This release includes a shared library which was built with its installed
location compiled in the binary. That is, applications linking with this
release of the XForms shared library for UnixWare 7 will automatically know
where to find the shared libary - no modification to LD_LIBRARY_PATH or
LD_RUN_PATH is necessary. Do not move the XForms shared libary from its
install location in /usr/local/lib.

=============================================================================
This is the binary distribution of XForms, a graphical user interface
toolkit for X Window Systems. It should work under X11 R4, R5 & R6.
XForms is free and unrestricted for non-commercial and non-profit use.
For commercial use, including in-house and consulting, please
contact xforms@world.std.com for licensing info.

Shared library may or may not be provided. If it is not,
that means your platform probably does not support it or 
I don't know how to make it.

Depending on platforms and ld, you probably will have to move
the shared library out of FORMS/ to make the demos, or set
LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or LD_RUN_PATH on OpenBSD/pmax) to include FORMS/

Some of the demos won't compile without the xpm library. You can
get it from ftp://avahi.inria.fr/pub/xpm or ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib.

OpenGL/Mesa stuff:

On some platforms, the mesa support is in the static library, 
but may not be in the shared library. If you would like to add 
it to the shared libary, you can do so by extract everything
from the static library libforms.a and re-make the shared
library or compiling FORMS/glcanvas.c and put it in the shared library. 
Take a look at mkconfig.h to see how to make the shared library.

NOTE: On SGI, the OpenGL support (glcanvas.o, that is) was compiled using
      the real thing. One other platforms, it was compiled
      using mesa. If your platform is not sgi and you have
      real OpenGL, you *must* remove glcanvas.o from the library
      and re-compile FORMS/glcanvas.c using the real OpenGL headers.

-----------
All changes should be made to mkconfig.h and they will propagate
to other makefiles.


DEMOS/  contains a menu driven demo/test suite. Type make to generate
        all the executables. program DEMOS/demo is the master driver.
        (only if "current directory" . is on your path).

        If you're using the shared lib, you don't need to have
        -lXpm to compile as it is stuffed inside the shared lib.

        If you're using static lib, some of the demos won't link
        without -lXpm

FORMS/  contains the library and necessary headers, which can be
        installed by typing make install.

        glcanvas.c is a sample implementation of specialized
        canvases.

DESIGN/ contains a GUI builder that helps you design interaction
        dialogs interactively and write the form generation C code.
