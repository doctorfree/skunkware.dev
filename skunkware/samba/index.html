                    Samba is an
                    <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open source</a>
                    software suite that provides seamless file and print
                    services to SMB/CIFS clients. Samba is freely available
                    under the

                  <p>WHAT IS SMB?</p>

                  <p>
                    The very short answer is that it is the protocol by which a
                    lot of PC-related machines share files and printers and
                    other informatiuon such as lists of available files and
                    printers. Operating systems that support this natively
                    include Windows NT, OS/2, and Linux and add on packages that
                    achieve the same thing are available for DOS, Windows, VMS,
                    Unix of all kinds, MVS, and more. Apple Macs and some Web
                    Browsers can speak this protocol as well. Alternatives to
                    SMB include Netware, NFS, Appletalk, Banyan Vines, Decnet
                    etc; many of these have advantages but none are both public
                    specifications and widely implemented in desktop machines by
                    default.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The Common Internet Filesystem (CIFS) is what the new SMB
                    initiative is called. For details watch

                  <p>WHY DO PEOPLE WANT TO USE SMB?</p>

                  <p></p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Many people want to integrate their Microsoft or IBM style
                      desktop machines with their Unix or VMS (etc) servers.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Others want to integrate their Microsoft (etc) servers
                      with Unix or VMS (etc) servers. This is a different
                      problem to integrating desktop clients.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Others want to replace protocols like NFS, DecNet and
                      Novell NCP, especially when used with PCs.

                  <p>WHAT CAN SAMBA DO?</p>

                  <p>
                    Here is a very short list of what samba includes, and what
                    it does. For many networks this can be simply summarised by
                    "Samba provides a complete replacement for Windows NT, Warp,
                    NFS or Netware servers."
                  </p>

                  <p></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      a SMB server, to provide Windows NT and LAN Manager-style
                      file and print services to SMB clients such as Windows 95,
                      Warp Server, smbfs and others.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      a NetBIOS (rfc1001/1002) nameserver, which amongst other
                      things gives browsing support. Samba can be the master
                      browser on your LAN if you wish.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      a ftp-like SMB client so you can access PC resources
                      (disks and printers) from 1, Netware and other operating
                      systems
                    </li>

                    <li>a tar extension to the client for backing up PCs</li>

                    <li>
                      limited command-line tool that supports some of the NT
                      administrative functionality, which can be used on Samba,
                      NT workstation and NT server.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  For a much better overview have a look at the web site at
                  <a href="http://samba.org/samba">http://samba.org/samba</a>,
                  and browse the user survey.

                    <li>
                      smbfs, a linux-only filesystem allowing you to mount
                      remote SMB filesystems from PCs on your linux box. This is
                      included as standard with Linux 2.0 and later.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      tcpdump-smb, a extension to tcpdump to allow you to
                      investigate SMB networking problems over netbeui and
                      tcp/ip.

                    <li>
                      smblib, a library of smb functions which are designed to

                  <p>CONTRIBUTIONS</p>

                  <p>
                    If you want to contribute to the development of the software
                    then please join the mailing list. The Samba team accepts
                    patches (preferably in "diff -u" format, see docs/BUGS.txt
                    for more details) and are always glad to receive feedback or
                    suggestions to the address samba-bugs@samba.org. We have
                    recently put a new bug tracking system into place which
                    should help the throughput quite a lot. You can also get the
                    Samba sourcecode straight from the CVS tree - see
                    <a href="http://samba.org/cvs.html"
                      >http://samba.org/cvs.html</a
                    >.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    You could also send hardware/software/money/jewelry or pizza
                    vouchers directly to Andrew. The pizza vouchers would be
                    especially welcome, in fact there is a special field in the
                    survey for people who have paid up their pizza :-)
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    If you like a particular feature then look through the CVS
                    change-log (on the web at
                    <a href="http://samba.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/samba">
                      http://samba.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/samba</a
                    >
                    ) and see who added it, then send them an email.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Remember that free software of this kind lives or dies by
                    the response we get. If noone tells us they like it then we
                    will probably move onto something else. However, as you can
                    see from the user survey quite a lot of people do seem to
                    like it at the moment :-)

                  <p>DOCUMENTATION</p>

                  <p>
                    There is quite a bit of documentation included with the
                    package, including man pages, and lots of .txt files with
                    hints and useful info. This is also available from the web
                    page. There is a growing collection of information under
                    docs/faq; by the next release expect this to be the default
                    starting point.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    A list of Samba documentation in languages other than
                    English is available on the web page.

                    listproc@samba.org with a body of "subscribe samba-announce

                  <p>NEWS GROUP</p>

                  <p>
                    You might also like to look at the usenet news group
                    comp.protocols.smb as it often contains lots of useful info
                    and is frequented by lots of Samba users. The newsgroup was
                    initially setup by people on the Samba mailing list. It is
                    not, however, exclusive to Samba, it is a forum for
                    discussing the SMB protocol (which Samba implements). The
                    samba list is gatewayed to this newsgroup.

                    A Samba WWW site has been setup with lots of useful info.

                    As well as general information and documentation, this also
                    has searchable archives of the mailing list and a user
                    survey that shows who else is using this package. Have you
                    registered with the survey yet? :-)
