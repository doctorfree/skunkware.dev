SCOadmin for Intranets provides you with tools to perform server 
administration functions from any JAVA capable web browser. Tasks 
which have traditionally been performed by the system administrator 
are now presented in an easy to use, platform-independent fashion by 
coupling SCO Visual Tcl technology, Java, and the SCOadmin Framework.   
By offering these limited function, applications directly to the end-user,
the system administrator can reduce the amount of time that they are
called out to perform routine tasks such as adding users, or stopping
print queues for paper jams.
</P>
<P>
<B>How It Works</B>
<P>
When a user activates a SCOadmin for Intranets link, this causes an 
application to launch out-of-place.  The application will look and behave 
in the same fashion as any native Desktop program. Once the application 
has started, it will continue to run until the user closes it or exits 
the web browser. 

</P>
<P>
<B>About SCO Visual Tcl</B>

</P>
<P>
SCO Visual Tcl is a high-level graphical scripting language for graphical
terminals. SCO Visual Tcl interprets commands and constructs graphical output
using Motif, Java, or the curses programming library , allowing the 
production of sophisticated cross-environment applications.

</P>
<P>
<B>About the SCOadmin Framework</B>
</P>
<P>
The use of the object-oriented SCOadmin framework enables SCOadmin For
Intranets applications to share common management services, including 
access to managed resources, management events, and logging services
as well as the sharing of common functions such as requests for information 
on installed media devices.  Reducing the reliance on "rlogin" or "telnet" 
for remote administration, framework-based SCOadmin applications provide 
authorized remote systems management of SCO environments.

</P>
<P>
<B>Support for this Release</B>
</P>
<P>
This is a preview release of the SCOadmin for Intranets package
and is not officially supported.  Please do not contact SCO Support 
for help in using this product.  Should you have questions about 
installing or using this package, you can email louisi@sco.com 

</P>
<P>

<B>SCOadmin For Intranets (0.99a) Installation</B>
</P>
<P>

SCOadmin for Intranets runs on operating systems 
based on SCO Gemini technology, including the Fall 1997 SCO UnixWare 
Forum Beta release.  Future releases will also support the SCO OpenServer 
platform, although this will require a new version of the
VTCL interpreter, which has yet to be released.

</P>
<P>
To install SCOadmin for Intranets, follow these steps:

</P>
<PRE>
STEP 1: Add a scoadmin account and install the SCOadmin For Intranets
        Software.

           As root, create the user "scoadmin".  The account home 
           directory must reside in:

	        /home/scoadmin
           
           Create the account using either the SCOadmin Accounts 
           Manager or the command:

		useradd -d /home/scoadmin -m  scoadmin

           Set the account password using the SCOadmin Accounts Manager 
           or the command:

		passwd scoadmin

	   This account must have "owner" authorization for some of the 
           applications to function.  The "owner" authorization can be 
           granted using the SCOadmin Accounts Manager or the command:
		
		/usr/lib/scoadmin/account/make-owner scoadmin


	   Then create the necessary log files directory 
           and symbolic links with the commands:

	        mkdir /var/jvtcld
	        chmod 755 /var/jvtcld
	        chown scoadmin /var/scoadmin

	   Once the scoadmin account is created, log in as the scoadmin
           user and install the SCOadmin For Intranets archive
           using the following commands:

	        uncompress scoai.tar.Z
	        tar xvf ./scoai.tar

	   Finally, export the SCO Visual Tcl proxy server for Java 
           into the system VTCL directory using the command:

	        mkdir /usr/lib/vtcl/jvtcld
	        ln -s /home/scoadmin/http/cgi-bin/proxy_vtcld /usr/lib/vtcl/jvtcld/proxy_vtcld

STEP 2: Configure a web server for use with SCOadmin For Intranets.

	   Using the Netscape Server Administration Tool, add a 
           new web server to your system.  The server should reside
           on port number 11604.  

           Set the document directory for the new web server to:

		 /home/scoadmin/http/docs

	   Configure the new webserver to support the CGI directory: 

		/home/scoadmin/http/cgi-bin

	   You must alias this directory to:

		 /cgi-bin

STEP 3:  Establish a Security Policy.

	   You might want to password-protect your SCOadmin For Intranets
	   website using the Netscape Server Administration Tool.  This 
           depends on the security requirements for your site.  The 
           sample applications provided with SCOadmin For Intranets give 
           users with access to the web server these capabilities:

		o New user accounts can be added to the system. (The UID field
                  and System Authorizations can NOT be specified.)

		o Printer queues can be enabled or disabled.

		o Printer requests can be accepted or rejected.

		o The user can add/delete/modify mail aliases maintained
                  in the file: 

			/home/scoadmin/http/docs/tcl/aliases.db

STEP 4:   Configure a Packet Filter.

           Regardless of your local policy, you should disable all outside 
           access to port 11604 from your system using the SCOadmin 
           Packet Filters manager if your server is connected to the Internet.
           This utility uses packet-filtering technology to prevent intruders 
           from obtaining accounts on your system.

STEP 5:   Configure sendmail.

	   If you want to use the alias configuration manager, use the
           SCOadmin Mail Administration Manager to add the following
           file to the mail system for alias processing (in addition
           to the base system alias file):

		/home/scoadmin/http/docs/tcl/aliases.db
</PRE>

</PRE>

<B>NOTES FOR THIS RELEASE</B>
<P>
We made the following observations in running this beta release of
SCOadmin For Intranets.
<OL>
	<LI>  The system works best for clients with browsers that support 
            the Just In Time (JIT) Java runtime compiler such as Netscape
            Communicator.  

	<LI>  CPU's comparable to Intel's Pentium Processor are strongly 
            recommended.

	<LI>  This system includes a JAVA-based rendering engine for SCO 
            Visual Tcl.  Using this tool you can build your own scripts
            to provide administrative access to end-users.  David Young's
            book, The Visual Tcl Handbook, available from Prentice Hall,
            provides both excellent examples and instruction.

	<LI>  After several application invocations from the browser, 
            the SCO Vtcl Java Applet (jvtcld) may exit with a "mux 
            processing" error.  Restarting the browser, fixes the
            problem.

	<LI>  There are several incompatabilities between SCO Visual Tcl
            for MOTIF and the Java SCO Visual Tcl rendering engine
            provided with SCOadmin For Intranets.  These include the
            following:
<UL>
		<LI> Do not align widgets with menus when using SCOadmin
                  for Intranets.  Instead, align with the top of the 
                  containing FORM.

		<LI> The VtSetAppValues command is not yet implemented.

		<LI> The VtDrawnList family of widgets, will currently only
                  work with Text containing STRING datatypes (the other
                  types are simple ignored and not displayed).

		<LI> The VtComboBox widget is not functioning properly in
                  the Applet environment.

		<LI> The VtFileSelectionDialog widget is implemented as
                  a script in /usr/lib/vtcl/vtcl.tlib.   It does not
                  currently provide a native look and feel.

		<LI> The maximum size of a FORM is fixed at 500x400.

		<LI> Several command options are not yet fully implemented
                  including:
<UL>
		<LI> Pixmap support has not yet been added.  We plan to
                  support GIF and JPEG graphics in a future release.

		<LI> autoSelect options are currently ignored.

		<LI> valueChangedCallback options are currently ignored.

		<LI> MOTIF_ options are currently passed to the JAVA
                  rendering engine as well as to the MOTIF one.

		<LI> the tabList option is not yet supported

		<LI> the notify option is not yet implemented for list related
                  commands.

		<LI> VtLabel does not understand NEWLINE characters

		<LI> the font option is not supported

		<LI> the xmArgs option is not supported

		<LI> packing is not yet supported for VtRowColumn 

		<LI> the filename option is not supported for VtText
</UL>
</UL>
	<LI> Occasionally, the Netscape Navigator Java cache has been seen to
           become corrupted on SCO platforms.  If the applications, fail
           to start, this may be the problem.  From the Netscape Navigator
           menu select Options->Network Preferences and flush both memory
           and disk cache.  SCOadmin For Intranets should then function
           properly.
