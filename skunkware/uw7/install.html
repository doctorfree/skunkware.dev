SCO Skunkware 7 contains both file-system format packages suitable for 
installation on SCO UnixWare systems with the pkgadd facility and media 
images suitable for installation on SCO OpenServer systems with the custom 
utility, In addition, there are compressed archives of pre-compiled utilities
which can be extraced manually. Finally, there are hundreds of source archives 
(almost everything on the CD is accompanied by the source used to build it).
<P>
SCO Skunkware 7 is both an installation media (recognizable by pkgadd and
PackageMgr) and a mountable filesystem. In the text that follows, the string
<I>mount-point</I> will refer to the full pathname of the CD-ROM mount point
(for example, you may choose to mount the CD-ROM on /usr/skunkware in which
case <I>mount-point</I> would refer to /usr/skunkware).
<P>
<B>Installation on SCO UnixWare</B>
<P>
The following is repeated in the Skunkware 7 release notes in the section
"<A HREF="relnotes.html#installing">Installing the Skunkware 7 Software</A>".
<P>
To install most of the software available on the CD,
you can invoke one of the following as a system owner:
<P>
<HR>
<OL>
<LI>After mounting the CD-ROM, run the command:
<PRE>
    # /&lt;mount-point&gt;/INSTALL
</PRE>
This is the recommended Skunkware 7 installation procedure.
The INSTALL program will detect which platform you are installing on,
(possibly) ask some questions and install all the available packaged files 
for that platform. On UnixWare 7 this installation method also installs several 
additional UnixWare 2.x packages in /&lt;mount-point&gt;/uw2/Packages, 
consuming around 30 MB of additional disk space. UnixWare 7 installs will also
be given the opportunity to update /etc/magic with the augmented /etc/magic
on Skunkware 7 when using this installation method.
<LI>After mounting the CD-ROM, run the command:
<PRE>
    # pkgadd -d /&lt;mount-point&gt; [glib tcl802 tk802 all | package_list]
</PRE>
<LI>Prior to mounting the CD-ROM, you can install the software with:
<PRE>
    # pkgadd -d /dev/cdrom/c1b0t010 [glib tcl802 tk802 all | package_list]
</PRE>
where /dev/cdrom/c1b0t0l0 is the device node name of your CD-ROM drive
(this may vary from system to system).
</OL>
<HR>
<P>
The installation of all the Skunkware 7 components requires about 150 MB 
of free space on the root partition for OpenServer, about 500 MB of free 
space on the partition used by /usr/local for UnixWare 7 and around 80 MB
on UnixWare 2.x.
<P>
Almost all of the files in the Skunwkare 7 distribution will be installed
in /usr/local. Unfortunately, in UnixWare 7 the /usr/local directory is on
the root filesystem and contains the Netscape Navigator plugins. Therefore,
you may wish to move the existing /usr/local hierarchy to a filesystem with
sufficient disk space and create a symbolic link from /usr/local. For instance,
assuming you had created a /u filesystem with plenty of space:
<PRE>
    # mv /usr/local /u/local
    # ln -s /u/local /usr/local
</PRE>
<P>
Further platform-specific installation instructions are available in the 
<A HREF="relnotes.html">Skunkware 7 Release Notes</A>:

<LI><A HREF="relnotes.html#uw7">UnixWare 7 Installation</A>
<LI><A HREF="relnotes.html#uw2">UnixWare 2.x Installation</A>
<LI><A HREF="relnotes.html#osr5">OpenServer 5 Installation</A>
</UL>
<P>
After completing the installation of the Skunkware 7 components you desire,
you may wish to add /usr/local/bin to your PATH and /usr/local/man to your
MANPATH. You may also wish to add /usr/local/java to your CLASSPATH. It should
not be necessary to add /usr/local/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH as the
Skunkware 7 shared libraries have been built with the appropriate flags.
<P>
To query the system about installed Skunkware 7 packages, issue the command:
<PRE>
    # pkginfo -c skunkware
</PRE>
<P>
The Skunkware 7 components intended for installation on UnixWare 7 are
in pkgadd-installable file system format. What this means is that you
can install these Skunkware 7 components by issuing the command:
<PRE>
    # pkgadd -d /dev/cdrom/c1b0t0l0
</PRE>
(where c1b0t0l0 indicates the CD-ROM device node for the drive in which
the Skunkware CD-ROM has been inserted - the exact name of this node may
vary from system to system).
<P>
To install all of the Skunkware 7 pkgadd components, issue the command:
<PRE>
    # pkgadd -d /dev/cdrom/c1b0t0l0 glib tcl802 tk802 all
</PRE>
<P>
To install an individual package, execute the command:
<PRE>
    # pkgadd -d /dev/cdrom/c1b0t0l0 package_name
</PRE>
        where "package_name" is the name of the desired component.
  <P>      
For a list of all the pkg installable components see the file 
<A HREF="packages_a.html">packages_a.html</A>.
<P>
You may also invoke pkgadd with the mount-point as an argument.
For instance, if the Skunkware 7 CD-ROM has been mounted on /mnt, then the
Skunkware 7 software can be installed by issuing the command:
<PRE>
    # pkgadd -d /mnt glib tcl802 tk802 all
</PRE>
or, to select packages to install:
<PRE>
    # pkgadd -d /mnt
</PRE>
<P>
The Skunkware components are installed into /usr/local and in total consume 
about 380 MB. 
<P>
An interactive graphical installation can be performed by running 
/usr/X/bin/PackageMgr (with owner permissions):
<P>
Select "CD-ROM" from the "Install from" Combo Box.
<P>
Wait for the Packages to be scanned then select the Packages you want
installed and press the install button.
<P>
<B>SCO OpenServer</B>
<P>
The media images for SCO OpenServer are located in /<I>mount-point</I>/osr5/inst
on the CD-ROM. The packages will be exported to /usr/local and in total
consume about 150 MB.
<P>
To install an individual package, execute the command:
<PRE>
    # custom -p SKUNK97:default:Package -i -z /<I>mount-point</I>/osr5/inst
</PRE>
where "Package" is the name of the desired component. See the file
/<I>mount-point</I>/osr5/CONTENTS for the list of available components.
<P>
An interactive graphical installation can be performed by running 
/etc/custom as root and choosing to install from "media images". 
Enter the pathname of the media images (e.g. /<I>mount-point</I>/osr5/inst) 
and choose to do a full install.
<P>
If, as root, you are running the X.Desktop, then you can configure your
system to mount the SCO Skunkware 7 CD-ROM by double-clicking the System
Administration folder -> Filesystems -> Filesystem Manager. Alternatively,
at a root shell prompt, type "scoadmin f" to bring up the Filesystem Manager.
Next select Mount -> Add Mount Configuration -> Local and enter /dev/cd0 for 
the device and a mount point. Change the "Can Users Mount" 
to Yes and uncheck the "At System Startup" mount. After completing this 
operation, you should be able to mount and unmount the SCO Skunkware 7 CD-ROM 
by typing "mnt <I>mount-point</I>" and "umnt <I>mount-point</I>" as any user.
<P>

<P>
This cdrom is built as a mountable filesystem, and may be mounted
to view, use, or install.  To mount the cdrom, use the mount(ADM)
command with the mount point of your choice.
<BR>
OpenServer :
<PRE>
    # mount -r /dev/cd0 /<I>mount-point</I>
</PRE>
    or
<BR>
UnixWare :
<PRE>
    # mount -r -f cdfs /dev/cdrom/c1b0t210 /<I>mount-point</I>
</PRE>

Source code is provided in the /src directory.  
In some cases, source code is provided but no
compiled binaries. The source distributions are in gzip-compressed
tar or cpio format. In order to extract these, use the command:

<PRE>
    $ gzcat /<I>mount-point</I>/src/&lt;directory&gt;/&lt;package&gt;.tar.gz | tar xf -
</PRE>

or, in the case of a compressed cpio archive:

<PRE>
    $ gzcat /<I>mount-point</I>/src/&lt;directory&gt;/&lt;package&gt;.cpio.gz | cpio -icdu
</PRE>

Where &lt;directory&gt; refers to the top-level source directory
and &lt;package&gt; is the package name (e.g. gzip-1.2.4).
<P>
If you do not have gzcat installed (part of the gzip package), you can
install it off of the SCO Skunkware 7 CD via the command:

<PRE>
        # custom -p SKUNK97:default:GZIP -i -z /<I>mount-point</I>/osr5/inst
</PRE>
