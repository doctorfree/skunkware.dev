The files *built.tar.gz contain gzip'd tar archives of
source hierarchies compiled on SCO UnixWare 7.

To install, extract the gzip'd archive, cd into the
subdirectory, and (as root) run the command "make install".

For example :

	# gzcat binutils-2.8.1-built.tar.gz | tar xf -
	# cd binutils-2.8.1
	# make install
