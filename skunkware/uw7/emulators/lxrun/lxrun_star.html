Alternately, you can ala carte' the libs, but this package requires many
relatively obscure ones.   If you place any value on your time (even with
a slow link) you'll find that using the above library package (and thanking
Ron Record and Steve Ginsburg for making it available) productive.

The first obstacle is to get RPM running under the emulated environment.
We decide instead to circumvent this obstacle instead of tackling it.
StarOffice comes with an RPM package that contains a utility to convert
an RPM to a cpio image.    Since the StarOffice package is well-contained
in a single directory (/opt/StarOffice-3.1) it's "safe" to just extract
everything.
<PRE>
$ cd /mnt/rpm
$ cp rpm* /tmp
$ cp /tmp
$ gzcat  rpm-2.2.6-1.i386.cpio.gz | cpio -ivd usr/bin/rpm2cpio
$ lxrun usr/bin/rpm2cpio < /mnt/*common* | (cd / ; cpio -ivd)
$ lxrun usr/bin/rpm2cpio < /mnt/*e-english* | (cd / ; cpio -ivd)
$ lxrun usr/bin/rpm2cpio < /mnt/*statbin* | (cd / ; cpio -ivd)
$ cd $LINUX_ROOT
$ mkdir -p usr/X11R6/lib/X11
$ ln -s /usr/lib/X11/XKeysymDB usr/X11R6/lib/X11
</PRE>
You want the statbin images above unless you have a compatible 
Linux(R) Motif.   I didn't.  If you do, good luck. 
<P>
If you want to try to run the setup scripts, start with this patch 
to /opt/StarOffice-3.1/setup.   Personally, I never found them 
necessary or useful.   Besides, it drops core, and I didn't feel
like disassembling it to find why.  :-) Dink with setup program if 
you like.
<P>
Ultimately, the primary purpose of setup is to emit a shell script
that should be sourced from your shell.   I ran it on rjlinux, then 
modified it slightly for the lxrun environment.  You may have to do 
the same.   You could just start with mine.

Now, if you look in /opt/StarOffice-3.1/linux-x86/bin you will find
scalc3, schare3, sdraw3, simage3, smath3, and swriter3.  I have 
successfully started all six application simultaneously.  Yes, my
48Mb system was in the hole for available memory, though it worked
just groovy.
<P>
You may wish to configure lxfront for these binaries.   See that
doco for more info.   
<P>

RANDOM NOTES:
<P>
	I don't know *what* Star is doing when any of the X clients start,
        but they all completely freeze the native X server on my system (dual 
	P100 running 5.0.4c) for about 30 seconds while they start.  After
	that, X performance is fine.
<P>
	If you have compiled lxrun with tracing while running these,
	you're in for a treat.   These are large, complicated programs
	and will generate dozens of megabytes of log files just during
	startup.
<P>
	Don't ask me StarOffice questions.   My grand total of experience
	with them was beating on lxrun until they booted, spending about
	sixty seconds in each to give them the acid test.  "Hey, I can 
	type numbers in these rows and columns.   Yep, looks like a 
	spreadsheet allright."
<P>
	Some additional training is likely necessary to teach Star
	to build pipes to SCO's lp systems.   I *think* (actually, I
	pray) that lxrun will actually get pipes between emulated and
	native binaries right as a result of much bludgeoning that
	I and others have done in the 0.8.7 and 0.8.8 families.
<P>
	I have no idea how to work out the licensing issues on this.
	It claims that it's free for non-commercial use, but my
	spin on this is that if you're going to use it in a commercial
	environment, you should buy the commercial LINUX license and
	complain that a native version should be created.    All the
	whining in the world about wanting applications won't garner
	nearly the attention of a large number of Purchase Orders coming
	through their system that say "Operating System: OpenServer"
	written in.   Money talks.   If you like the program, pay the
	people to get your vote in.
