@@@STARTPACK(perl;PERL scripting language)

<P>PERL is a scripting language in use in many sites today. It combines
the best features of sed, awk, shell scripts and even a little BASIC.
It is commonly used for administrative tasks, and for WWW CGI scripts.
Many tools depend on perl, and no system is complete without it.</P>
