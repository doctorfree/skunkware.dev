[ See below for note on the DtwmAddInit.tar.gz desktop initialization files ]

These X11 Window Managers are under development and experimental.
For a pretty good list of available Window Managers and comparisons,
see http://www.PLiG.org/xwinman/

To test one of these, extract the dist archive from / as root

In order to use the newly installed window manager from within
your CDE X session, you will need to add something like the following
to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file :

!
! To start Enlightenment as your X11 Window Manager use this
!
Dtsession*wmStartupCommand: /usr/local/bin/enlightenment
Dtsession*waitWmTimeout: 1

or

!
! To start Fvwm95 as your X11 Window Manager use this
!
Dtsession*wmStartupCommand: /usr/local/bin/fvwm95
Dtsession*waitWmTimeout: 1

Alternatively, you can set your system up so that the additional
window managers are recognized by dtlogin and startup scripts are
provided. Users need to do nothing to use these new window managers
(although in many cases, users will want to personally configure
the window manager via a preferences file in their home directory).

To set your system up to work with the new window managers, extract
the file WmAddInit.tar.gz from / as root. Prior to this extraction,
you should back up the file /etc/dt/config/C/Xresources if it exists.

Note that if a user has a $HOME/.xinitrc or $HOME/.xsession then that
will override the default startup scripts extracted from WmAddInit.tar.gz
and located in /usr/local/dt/config.

=================================DtwmAddInit============================

Included here also is the file DtwmAddInit.tar.gz which contains dtwm
and CDE initialization and configuration files to be extracted into
a user's home directory. To do this, execute the commands :
	$ cd
	$ gzcat <path-to-archive>/DtwmAddInit.tar.gz | tar xf -

Before extracting these files, you can backup your current versions
by downloading the file DtwmAddInit.sh and executing it. Your original
configuration files, if any, will be archived in $HOME/DtwmBackInit.tar.
