SCO Skunkware 99 contains packages suitable for installation on 
SCO OpenServer 5 and UnixWare 7 systems with the Software Manager
(/etc/custom on OpenServer and pkgadd on UnixWare).
In order for the UnixWare 7 packages to be useful on
UnixWare 2.x, the appropriate compatibility package will be needed.
<P>
SCO Skunkware 99 is both an installation media (recognizable by custom,
pkgadd and PackageMgr) and a mountable filesystem. In the text that follows, 
the string
<I>mount-point</I> will refer to the full pathname of the CD-ROM mount point
(for example, you may choose to mount the CD-ROM on /usr/skunkware in which
case <I>mount-point</I> would refer to /usr/skunkware).
<P>
<B>Installation on SCO OpenServer 5 or UnixWare 7</B>
<P>
The following is repeated in the Skunkware 99 release notes in the section
"<A HREF="relnotes.html#installing">Installing the Skunkware 99 Software</A>".
<P>
To install the SCO Skunkware 99 software, mount the CDROM and run the
INSTALL program:
<PRE>
UnixWare 7
   # mount -r -f cdfs /dev/cdrom/cdrom1 /&lt;mount-point&gt;
OpenServer 5
   # mount -r /dev/cd0 /&lt;mount-point&gt;
Either
   # /&lt;mount-point&gt;/INSTALL
</PRE>
This is the recommended Skunkware 99 installation procedure.
The INSTALL program will detect which platform you are installing on,
(possibly) ask some questions and install all the available packaged files 
for that platform.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The installation of all the Skunkware 99 components requires several hundred
Megabytes of free space on the partition used by /usr/local (UnixWare 7)
or /opt/K/SKUNK99 (OpenServer).
<P>
Almost all of the files in the Skunwkare 99 distribution will be installed
in /usr/local. Typically the /usr/local directory is on
the root filesystem. Therefore, you may wish to move the existing 
/usr/local hierarchy to a filesystem with sufficient disk space and create a 
symbolic link from /usr/local. For instance, assuming you had created a /u 
filesystem with plenty of space, prior to installing Skunkware 99:
<PRE>
   # mv /usr/local /u/local
   # ln -s /u/local /usr/local
</PRE>
On SCO OpenServer, the custom installed Skunkware 99 files will reside
in /opt/K/SKUNK99. Therefore to install these in an alternate filesystem,
<PRE>
   # mkdir /u/SKUNK99
	 # ln -s /u/SKUNK99 /opt/K/SKUNK99
</PRE>
Setting the appropriate symbolic link up prior to installing Skunkware 99
can avoid potential serious problems with consuming the root filesystem
free disk space and/or inodes.
<P>
Further platform-specific installation instructions are available in the 
<A HREF="relnotes.html">Skunkware 99 Release Notes</A>:
<P>
After completing the installation of the Skunkware 99 components you desire,
you may wish to add /usr/local/bin to your PATH and /usr/local/man to your
MANPATH. You may also wish to add /usr/local/java to your CLASSPATH. It should
not be necessary to add /usr/local/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH as the
Skunkware 99 shared libraries have been built with the appropriate flags.
<P>
To query the system about installed Skunkware 99 packages, issue the command:
<PRE>
UnixWare
   # pkginfo -c skunkware
OpenServer
   # /etc/custom -p SKUNK99:default -l
</PRE>
<P>
The Skunkware 99 components intended for installation on UnixWare 7 are
in pkgadd-installable file system format. What this means is that you
can install these Skunkware 99 components by issuing the command:
<PRE>
UnixWare
   # pkgadd -d /dev/cdrom/cdrom1
OpenServer
   # /etc/custom
	 (select the CD-ROM device)
</PRE>
(where cdrom1 indicates the CD-ROM device node for the drive in which
the Skunkware CD-ROM has been inserted - the exact name of this node may
vary from system to system).
<P>
To install an individual package, execute the command:
<PRE>
UnixWare
   # pkgadd -d /dev/cdrom/cdrom1 package_name
OpenServer
   # /etc/custom -p SKUNK99:default:package_name -i -m /dev/rcd0
</PRE>
        where "package_name" is the name of the desired component.
  <P>      
For a list of all the pkg installable components see the file 
<A HREF="COMPONENTS.html">COMPONENTS.html</A>.
<P>
You may also invoke pkgadd with the mount-point as an argument.
For instance, if the Skunkware 99 CD-ROM has been mounted on /mnt, then the
Skunkware 99 software can be installed by issuing the command:
<PRE>
    # pkgadd -d /mnt glibs xpm qtfree Eterm speechtoo xpdf xlockmore glib all
</PRE>
or, to select packages to install:
<PRE>
    # pkgadd -d /mnt
</PRE>
<P>
The Skunkware components are installed into /usr/local and in total consume 
several hundred Megabytes of disk space.
<P>
On UnixWare, an interactive graphical installation can be performed by running 
/usr/X/bin/PackageMgr (with owner permissions):
<P>
Select "CD-ROM" from the "Install from" Combo Box.
<P>
Wait for the Packages to be scanned then select the Packages you want
installed and press the install button.
<P>
On OpenServer, an interactive graphical installation can be performed by
running the Software Manager (/etc/custom).
<HR>
<P>
This cdrom is built as a mountable filesystem, and may be mounted
to view, use, or install.  To mount the cdrom, use the mount(ADM)
command with the mount point of your choice.
<BR>
OpenServer :
<PRE>
    # mount -r /dev/cd0 /<I>mount-point</I>
</PRE>
    or
<BR>
UnixWare :
<PRE>
    # mount -r -f cdfs /dev/cdrom/cdrom1 /<I>mount-point</I>
</PRE>
