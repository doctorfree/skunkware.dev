The files *built.tar.gz contain gzip'd tar archives of
source hierarchies compiled on SCO UnixWare X.X
(the SCO Forum Gemini Beta operating system based on
System V Release 5 UNIX).

To install, extract the gzip'd archive, cd into the
subdirectory, and (as root) run the command "make install".

For example :

	# gzcat binutils-2.8.1-built.tar.gz | tar xf -
	# cd binutils-2.8.1
	# make install
