I've included my personal dtwmrc here for your perusal.
It sorta shows what all you can do to personalize your
default UnixWare 7 window manager environment.

This file should be viewed as a guide or template or something.
There's lots of stuff in it that probably doesn't exist on
your system (although if you install Skunkware 7 you may end
up with most of it functional).

This file goes in $HOME/.dt/ as the file dtwmrc

Once it (or something like it) is installed, your dtwm root window
will provide you with cascading menus. Try clicking the left, middle
and right mouse buttons on the root window.

The main root menu in this file uses the bitmap sco-logosm.xbm
which i have also included here as sco-logosm.xbm.gz. Install it
in /usr/include/X11/bitmaps as sco-logosm.xbm after uncompressing
with gunzip.

Turns out dtwm and pmwm use the same format rc files so you may be
able to use this dtwmrc with Panorama (pmwm) as well. Just rename
it to $HOME/.pmwmrc and try it out.
