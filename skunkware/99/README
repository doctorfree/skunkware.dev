To install the Skunkware 7 software, mount the CD-ROM and run the
INSTALL command :

    # mount -r -f cdfs /dev/cdrom/c0b0t0l0 /mnt
    # /mnt/INSTALL

The precise name of the cdrom device node may vary from system to system.

A full installation consumes well over 400 MB. The files are installed in
/usr/local. You may wish to make /usr/local a symbolic link to a filesystem
with sufficient space. If you do so, you should move any existing /usr/local
first (e.g. /usr/local/lib/netscape). For example :

    # mv /usr/local /u/local
    # ln -s /u/local /usr/local
