This directory contains useful Java classes, tools, applets and applications.
Please contribute additional packages by dropping them off in /pub/incoming
and e-mailing rr@sco.com. You may also request specific packages via e-mail.

The initial guidelines for the creation of these packages are fairly simple.
    - All packages contain both the source (.java) and class files (.class)
    - All packages are installed by root with the command :
        # cd / ; gzcat <path-to-archive>/foo.tar.gz | tar xf -
    - All packages contain a README describing the contents, documentation,
      original location of source, author, installation, use, testing and
      name/e-mail of contributor.
    - The README should be submitted separately and as part of the archive
    - All packages should install in /usr/local if possible.
      + Java classes in /usr/local/java/package-name
      + Shell script front-ends, utilities, command-line interfaces
        in /usr/local/bin
    - If possible, provide a shell script front-end to applications which
      checks the CLASSPATH and sets it if necessary. For instance :
            # Change this to point to your own Java classes directory.
            MY_CLASSPATH=/usr/local/java
            if [ "$CLASSPATH" = "" ] ; then
                CLASSPATH="$MY_CLASSPATH"
                export CLASSPATH
            else
                echo $CLASSPATH | grep $MY_CLASSPATH > /dev/null || {
                    CLASSPATH="$CLASSPATH:$MY_CLASSPATH"
                }
            fi
    - Man pages in /usr/local/man/man[123456789n] and formatted man pages in
      /usr/local/man/cat[123456789n]
 
    - Additional documentation in /usr/local/info or /usr/local/htdocs

Please feel free to comment on these guidelines. Suggestions welcome.

Right now the Java FTP site on johndoe.pdev.sco.com contains the following :

Acme.tar.gz
===========

These Java classes were downloaded from Jef Poskanzer's ACME Laboratories.
The ACME Labs home page is at http://www.acme.com/ and includes some
remarkably useful freeware.

In addition to the Acme class library, i have also downloaded and packaged
up a few of Jef's Java applications. These include :

    WebCat  - fetch URLs and write them to stdout 
    WebList - make a list of the files in a web subtree 
    WebCopy - copy a remote web subtree to the local disk 
    WebGrep - search a web subtree for a pattern 
    WebPost - post a web query and write the results to stdout 
    ToPpm   - dump out an image URL as PPM 
    ToGif   - dump out an image URL as GIF 

Also included is the Java application wrapper script JavaWrapper and
a sample shell script i wrote called webget which front-ends the
action of WebCat.

The Acme class library gets extracted, by default, into /usr/local/java/Acme.
The Java applications get extracted into /usr/local/java and the shell
script wrappers get extracted into /usr/local/bin.

The JavaWrapper script checks to see if your CLASSPATH environment variable
is set. If not, it sets it to /usr/local/java. If set, it checks to see
if /usr/local/java is a component and, if not, appends that.

Many other useful and fun things are at ACME Laboratories.

If you have questions about the packaging of these classess, you may
address them to me, Ron Record, via rr@sco.com.
