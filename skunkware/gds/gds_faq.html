<ul>
<li>
Why don't static constructors and destructors work in C++? <p>
If you have SCO OpenServer 5.0.0, you should install 
<a href="ftp://ftp.sco.com/tls/"> TLS597 </a> after 
installing the GNU dev sys.     This corrects
several problems with the system startup and teardown files.
This is believed to be unnecessary on systems that identify themselves
as anything greater than 3.2v5.0.0 with a uname -X.
<P>
<li>Where are all the headers for libg++?<P>

The cut of the installable images for the 95.4b version as it appears
on Skunkware '96 was faulty.  You can should update to the 95.4c version
of the  gds that corrects this problem.   It's available at

<a href="ftp://www.dgii.com/users/robertl/scods/"> Robert's Master Site </a>
or

<li> What does it take to make a .so with these tools? <p>
When attempting to build a .so, just forget about the -shared flag
to gcc. It does Bad Things.  If you use it, you get something like 
the following :
<PRE>
  	$ gcc -b elf -shared sub1.o sub2.o -o libsub.so
  	relocations referenced
  	        from file(s):
  	        /usr/ccs/lib/crt.o
  	        sub1.o
  	        sub2.o
  	fatal error: relocations remain against allocatable but non-writable
  	section: .text
</PRE>
Instead, use the following flags (similar to what you would do with SCO CC) :
<PRE>
            SCO CC          GCC
        ==============  ===============
Make things to go into .so
        -belf -KPIC         -belf -fpic

Make a .so
        -belf -G -KPIC      -belf -G -fpic

Use a .so
        -dy -KPIC           -belf 
</pre>

<li>
        Where can I get version 2.7.2 for SCO OpenServer?
<p>

        FSF Version 2.7.anything doesn't support SCO OpenServer.   My binary
        kits are built around the Cygnus quarterly releases, not the stock
        FSF version.   These two trees closely track each other, but do
        leapfrog from time to time.
	<p>

        I have eyeballed the diffs between 2.7.2 and the underlying
        version I used and remain unconvinced that there are
        any significant differences that affect x86 targets.
	<p>

        FSF 2.7.2.1 still doesn't support SCO OpenServer, but does fix some
        esoteric problems with wild (-O3 and up) optimization levels
	on x86 targets.
	<p>

        If you just really can't stand having those version
        numbers being different thatn the FSF releases, your options
        in increasing level of masochism, are:
<ul>
<li>
                Get over it.  Use the GDS kit.   It works.
<li>
                Wait for FSF 2.8.0.
<li>
                Snag the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.dgii.com/users/robertl/scods/patches">
patches used to create the tree </a>
                and smoosh them into a FSF version of your choice.
                Don't even think about bothering me if you can't make
                it work.
</ul>
<p>




<li>This compiler is broken.  When are you going to fix it?<P>

While I've had a lot of good feedback from all over the world from 
people that have found this tool useful, I've also had one or two
people get really abusive with me about it.   If you think you've
found a problem boil it to the bare minimum code necessary to recreate
it, include self-contained source, expected output, the compiler invocation
used, and so on.   Post the request for help in comp.unix.sco.programmer.
I will most likely see the post there.

<p>The surest way to not get me to help with your question is to name
some nifty 50 Gb package from the Net and tell me "it doesn't work."

<p>
Being rude with me isn't going to help your case either.   I'll just
give you a refund on what you paid me for the package. :-)
