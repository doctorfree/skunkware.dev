SCO Online Support - Technical Library Supplements - Skunkware 96 subset
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a collection of TLSs for SCO OpenServer created since the
last set that was included on Skunkware 5.  For a full, complete,
and up to date list, consult the ~/Skunk* directories at
ftp.sco.com or www.sco.com.


General info on TLSs:
---------------------

The files in TLS are offered for experimental or educational use.  They
are provided "as-is" to knowledgeable users as a courtesy.  The TLSs
are NOT supported by SCO Support department.   Please do not contact
the friendly folks in the Support department about these files; rather,
direct your comments to the original authors (where named), or to me.

In some cases, these are components or updates to existing SCO
Software.  Some of the programs here may be compiled or derived
from freely available copyrighted sources.  Other material may be
educational or supplementary documentation.  All use of this
material is the sole responsibility of the user, and you MUST
observe the copyright and licensing restrictions that are
provided in the cover letters, documentation, and code.

For other archive sites, consult the periodically posted list of
SCO-related ftp sites in one of the SCO-related Usenet newsgroups
or on Compuserve SCOFORUM.

Usually, you will need a licensed SCO operating system to use
these files, and any SCO-owned code here is provided to you under
the terms of your SCO software license(s).  You will also need a
good understanding of how to use the SCO system, and a certain
amount of daredevil, thrillseeking enjoyment of interesting and
colorful results.

The available supplements are listed below.

These files can also be downloaded interactively from the SCO Online
Support BBS.  Follow the menus in the "software toolchest"
selection.  We support kermit, Xmodem, Ymodem and Zmodem.

These files are also accessible via anonymous uucp and by
anonymous ftp, and of course with a suitably configured Internet
web browser at http://www.sco.com

Generally, we name the TLS distribution files like this:
  
       tlsxxx.1   = binary floppy image, volume 1
       tlsxxx.1.Z = same thing, but compressed
       tlsxxx.ltr = cover letter, ascii file - install info, etc.
       tlsxxx.c   = source code file
       tlsxxx.doc.Z = documentation and other propaganda
       tlsxxx.tar.Z = tar archive file, compressed.
       tlsxxx.tar*  = tar archive file                 
       tlsxxx.ps    = postscript file
       <something else> = miscellaneous documentation, etc.
       tls5xx.*     = TLS targetting SCO OpenServer Release 5
       tls5xx.custom = custom installable file for OpenServer Release 5
  
Files ending in .Z have been reduced in size by the SCO compress
utility.  The compress and uncompress utilities are included with
SCO XENIX releases 2.3.0 and later, SCO UNIX, and SCO Open
Desktop.  In some cases, we have compressed using the -H option
(LZH algorithm).  Your version of compress in SCO UNIX version
4.0 or later understands this.  If you have an older compress
utility, you may need to download the newer version of compress
in tls031.  The compressed floppy images need to be uncompressed
before you dd them onto a floppy or install from them as
media images.

Occasionally, we may post TLSs with filenames ending in .gz.
These are compressed with the GNU gzip program.  You can obtain
gzip from the Skunkware cd-rom, or in the /Skunk* directories
here.

We do not compress all floppy images.  Some SCO distributions
have files that are already compressed and to compress again is
counterproductive.  Some TLS files may just be tar files, not floppy
images.  In some cases the uucp g protocol may raise alarms when used
with certain modems that perform data compression.  If you get
uucp alarms, try turning off data compression in your modem, if it is
used.

There are a few gaps in the numbering, due to TLSs not yet ready,
withdrawn, and other assorted reasons.  Also, you may see some
numbers "reserved" for future additions.

Anyone is welcome to redistribute this notice to other newsgroups or
customers.  If you have comments about these distributions, feel free to
contact me.  E-mail _strongly_ preferred.  In some cases, authors have
provided their names and indicated willingness to correspond about the
TLSs.   Check the cover letters for author info.
