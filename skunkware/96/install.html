Installation Notes
</H1>
</CENTER>
<B>Note: These installation notes pertain to the SCO Skunkware 96 CD-ROM</B>
<BR>
For information on ordering this free CD, <A HREF="info.html">see info.html</A>.
<P>
Many of the SCO Skunkware 96 software packages can be installed using
SCO custom. To install using custom, as root execute the SCO custom
utility (/etc/custom). Select "Software -> Install New" from the main
menu. Next, select "Continue" to install from the local host. In the
"Media Device" pull-down menu, select "Media Images" and then "Continue".
Type in the location of the SCO Skunkware 96 CD-ROM mount point followed
by "/inst/All" (e.g. /cdrom/inst/All or /mnt/inst/All).
<P>
If you wish to install all of the SCO Skunkware 96 custom-installable
packages onto your hard disk, select "Full" (requires 80 Mb free disk
space in /opt which is typically on the root filesystem).
<P>
If you would like to view the list of custom-installable componenents, 
select "Partial". Select the package you would like to install and 
click "Install".
<P>
Alternatively, the Bourne Shell script
<A HREF="INSTALL">INSTALL</A> illustrates how to install individual
packages non-interactively via the SCO custom command line.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Many other software packages have not been packaged for installation
with SCO custom. Several of these can be installed by unpacking the
built source distribution and, as root, issuing the command "make install".
For instance, to install the INN InterNetNews system, perform the following
as root (assuming the SCO Skunkware 96 CD-ROM is mounted on /cdrom) :
<PRE>
	# cd /tmp
	# gzcat /cdrom/src/Tools/inn-1.4sec.tar.gz | tar xf -
	# cd inn-1.4sec
	# make install
</PRE>
Note that this assumes you have already installed the gzcat utility
(available on SCO Skunkware 96 as a custom installable package).
<P>
In order to easily access many of the installed SCO Skunkware 96
components, you may wish to add /usr/local/bin to your PATH and
/usr/local/man to your MANPATH. For instance, a Bourne shell user
could add the following to their $HOME/.profile :
<PRE>
	PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
	MANPATH=$MANPATH:/usr/local/man
	export PATH MANPATH
</PRE>
The system administrator can set these on a system-wide basis by
modifying the files /etc/default/login and /etc/default/man.
<P>
Finally, almost all of the software packages included on this CD-ROM
contain a README and/or INSTALL file containing instructions for obtaining,
extracting, building, and installing the software. In many cases, i have
also provided a ReadMe.html document relating this information as well.
I have tried to leave these descriptive documents (and man pages)
unextracted in the respective source directory. For instance, to read about
the Washington University FTP Server (wu-ftpd), see
<A HREF="src/Tools/wu-ftpd-2.4/">the wu-ftpd-2.4 source directory</A>.
To install wu-ftpd, see
<A HREF="src/Tools/wu-ftpd-2.4.tar.gz">the wu-ftpd-2.4 compressed archive</A>
and follow instructions similar to that given above for inn-1.4.
