I'm not convinced this port of Argus works correctly 100% of the time; I ran
into a few bugs in the code in porting and had to add assorted ntohs/ntohl 
calls in other places.  The "solaris2.5-uwe.patch" and "solaris_patches.readme"
patches seem to fix #3.

                                     NOTES

1) To install Argus add the following line to /etc/services:

   monitor         561/tcp         # Argus server process

2) when using ra -S machine you must wait some minutes for the timers to
   expire before you get data.  
   Each time you do a ra -S to connect to the machine the argus_mdi process
   resets its timers again (viewable with the -D -d options).

3) when using ra to print out the information the name1.port1  <->  name2.port2
   seems to be reversed in some circumstances.  The arrow points to the 
   destination machine according to the documentation.
  
   code works for ICMP packets - no problems seen.
   code works for UDP packets.

   Unfortunately, the code has many different checks for specific port 
   ranges for port/ip address/mac address reversal:
   TCP port 20(ftp-data)    ra
   TCP port 6000-6010 (X)   ra
   TCP port 20(ftp-data)    services
   TCP port 6000 only       services

   the routine reformat_datum() checks for both TCP and UDP:

   TCP port 20

   UDP:
               if (((sport == 53) && (dport != 53)) ||
                   ((sport == 2049) && (dport != 2049)) ||
                   ((sport >= 7000) && (sport < 7010)) ||
                   ((sport >= 6000) && (sport < 6010)))


   Be aware that packets whose ports fall into these ranges may be displayed
   incorrectly... 

4) the policy program is not included with this distribution.  I couldn't
   find it. :-(

5) ra -I seems to be broken.
