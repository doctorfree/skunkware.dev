ARPWATCH
</H1>
<HR>
</CENTER>
Arpwatch runs as a daemon, passively watching all ARP and RARP frames on 
the network.  When it finds a new machine or notices changes in the IP
address or MAC address it sends root mail.  
<P>
To actively probe each IP address in your local network to obtain its 
MAC address use another program like getethers (use Archie to find 
the current location of getethers) or just ping the broadcast address.
<P>
Arpwatch does not send any ARP requests or replies on the wire.
Arpwatch assumes sendmail has been installed and configured and exists as
/usr/lib/sendmail.
<P>
Installing arpwatch data files
<PRE>
mkdir -p /usr/operator/arpwatch
touch /usr/operator/arpwatch/arp.dat
cp ethercodes.dat /usr/operator/arpwatch
arpwatch
</PRE>
arpwatch logs any failures or unusual events to /usr/adm/syslog in addition
to sending root mail.  Errors have logging level arpwatch.error while 
all others are arpwatch.info.
<P>
If arpwatch sees a frame from outside your PCAP_IPMASK it will append a
"bogon" message to syslog.
If arpwatch detects a new machine or a NIC with a new IP address it
will send mail to root similar to the following:
<PRE>
     From root Tue Sep 12 21:05:50 1995
     Received: (root@localhost) by monitor.sco.com (8.6.8.1/SCA-6.6)
      id VAA02025 for root; Tue, 12 Sep 1995 21:05:50 GMT
     Return-Path: <root>
     Date: Tue, 12 Sep 1995 21:05:50 GMT
     Message-Id: <199509122105.VAA02025@monitor.sco.com>
     From: arpwatch (Arpwatch)
     To: root
     Subject: new station (xxx.uss.sco.COM)

            hostname: xxx.uss.sco.COM
          ip address: 132.147.2.123
    ethernet address: 2:60:8c:ab:f5:78
     ethernet vendor: 3Com IBM PC; Imagen; Valid; Cisco; Macintosh
           timestamp: Tuesday, September 12, 1995 14:05:50 -224178912 (PDT)
</PRE>
arpwatch writes new entries to /usr/operator/arpwatch/arp.dat.
If you have two NICs on the same network and PCAP_IPADDR/PCAP_IPMASK on the 
second NIC are the same as the IP address and netmask on the other NIC, 
ping the broadcast address of the first NIC.  
This will quickly fill up the arp cache on the local machine (arp -a to view)
as well as /usr/operator/arpwatch/arp.dat.
<P>
Lastly, if there is a flurry of activity that causes arpwatch to invoke
sendmail many times in rapid succession, arpwatch instructs sendmail to 
queue the mail for delivery at a later date.  This minimizes the load 
on the machine.
