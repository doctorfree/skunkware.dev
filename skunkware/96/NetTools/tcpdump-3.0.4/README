                                  -------

What media, frames and protocols does the SCO port of tcpdump-3.0.4 support?

Frames: AppleTalk, ARP, DECNET, IP, IPX, RARP in an Ethernet type II,
        SNAP, 802.3, or FDDI frame

Protocols: TCP UDP BOOTP DNS EGP ICMP NFS NTP OSPF RIP SNMP SunRPC TFTP


ftp'ed version 3.0.4 from ftp.ee.lbl.gov.
Added new -X option to print hex and ascii.
Applied T/TCP diffs from http://www.noao.edu/~rstevens/ttcp.html
Added many IPX-related enhancements:
- print network information in hex not decimal.
- changed decimal to hex in IPX printfs
- always IPX print {network, node, socket} triplet.
- add nflag/vflag support
- enhance existing SAP socket support to print a larger list of possible
- servers.  Complete list cannot be included in this distribution for
- legal reasons.  ftp.novell.com:/pub/netwire/ndevsup/14/DSAP1?.EXE
- add NCP socket support for all function/subfunction types with hashing
- based on function number for speed.
- add NDS support
- add NetBIOS socket support
- add diagnostics socket support
- add serialization socket support
- With IPX nflag means a) numeric and b) fast.  don't do any lookups from
  a number to its corresponding text if this flag is set.
- With IPX vflag means "don't worry how much data you present"; the user
  has an infinite-column display.  You'll get the most descriptive
  information, especially if it's NCP or NDS related.




                              RUNNING TCPDUMP
                              ---------------

tcpdump will start on the first NIC found in /dev/mdi that is not in use.
If there are multiple available NICs, you can specify which one to
use by running tcpdump with the -i option.  See tcpdump.1 for more information.

tcpdump statistics
------------------
When you stop tcpdump you will see statistics similar to

4 packets received by filter
2 packets dropped by kernel

If you are using the bpf STREAMS driver for filtering, each frame sent up
from the MDI driver to bpf will increment the "received frame" statistic.
If the bpf filter routine does not accept the frame (i.e. you only want to
show certain types of frames) OR bpf encounters a STREAMS
failure (see allocb(K)), then the "packets dropped by kernel" statistic
will increment.

If you are using user level filtering, the "received by" statistic represents
the number of frames received from the MDI driver.  If the user level filter
does not accept the frame as valid based on your filter then the
"packets dropped by kernel" statistic will increment.
