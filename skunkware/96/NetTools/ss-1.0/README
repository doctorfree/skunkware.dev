ss is a no-frills tool to show internal information about STREAMS on your 
system.  It shows all queues from the stream head and those queues which are
not reachable from the stream head, as well as any flow control
and (if possible) the responsible process or TCP/IP connection.  

Aside from being an educational tool, ss can be used to determine if STREAMS 
blocks aren't being released to the system because they're stuck in a 
full queue somewhere.  This can happen when TCP can't send any more 
data without exceeding the window size.  netstat -a will show this in 
the "Send-Q" column too.  NOTE: STREAMS blocks that are allocated with 
allocb(K) and not freed (freeb(K)) and not stuck on a queue will *not* 
show up with ss -- there's no way to know which driver is still using 
them (or lost track of them).

you can get the same information from crash(ADM)'s "queue" and "stream"
commands.  The flags are the same as crash and represent the following
from /usr/include/sys/stream.h:

en = QENAB
wr = QWANTR
ww = QWANTW
fl = QFULL
rr = QREADR
us = QUSE
ne = QNOENB

ss doesn't have any options.  It assumes /unix and /dev/kmem.

An early ODT3.0 version is buried on SLS net382e (ftp from ftp.sco.com in 
/SLS), although you must tar it off manually.
