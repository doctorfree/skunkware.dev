Changes description for NetTools package:

2.2: few changes:

  sockinfo2.7:
     - restrict -T and -U to root only.  Also included is a version
       for ODT3.0.  Note that ODT3.0 doesn't support as many options.
  ss:
     - added.  Shows all queues from stream head and queues not reachable from
       stream head.  useful to see protocol stacks and any streams blocks
       "stuck" due to flow control on the queue.  Tries to show process name.
       ODT3.0 version buried on SLS net382e although you must tar it off 
       manually.

  tcpdump:
     - removed -X option; integrated ASCII & hex frame output into -x and also
       when frame is "unknown".  Output similar to hd(C).

2.1: general performance improvements everywhere.

  sockinfo2.6:
     -  added unix domain socket support with -u option
  tcpdump-3.0.4:
     bugfixes:
     - the -F option no longer requires an absolute pathname. 

     enhancements: 
     - changed decimal to hex in IPX printfs
     - always print {network, node, socket} triplet.
     - add nflag/vflag support
     - enhance existing SAP socket support to print a larger list of possible
       servers.  Complete list cannot be included in this distribution for 
       legal reasons.  ftp.novell.com:/pub/netwire/ndevsup/14/DSAP1?.EXE
     - add NCP socket support for all function/subfunction types with hashing
       based on function number for speed.
     - add NDS support
     - add NetBIOS socket support
     - add diagnostics socket support
     - add serialization socket support
     + With ipx nflag means a) numeric and b) fast.  don't do any lookups from
       a number to its corresponding text if this flag is set.
     + With ipx vflag means "don't worry how much data you present"; the user 
       has an infinite-column display.  You'll get the most descriptive 
       information, especially if it's NCP or NDS related.

   argus-1.5:
     bugfixes:
     - applied "solaris2.5-uwe.patch" patch by hand (except -I "Buggy" patch)
     - applied "solaris_patches_readme" patch by hand
     both patches were obtained from the CMU ftp site.

   bpf:
     bugfixes:
     - typo when setting low water mark on queue.  fixed.

2.0: added argus, sockinfo, and courtney.  rework distribution.
     tcpdump : upgrade of source to 3.0.4 from 3.0.2 (no code changes - purely
               cosmetic)
               add T/TCP diffs to tcpdump from
               http://www.noao.edu/~rstevens/ttcp.tcpdump.diffs
               change printfs of IPX network from decimal to hex
     arpwatch: fix SIGCLD bug which created zombies.
     tcpdump : print IPX network in hex.
     tcpdump : add new -X option to print frame in both hex and printable ascii.

1.2.1: arpwatch: fixed bug which caused it to terminate after 30 minutes.

1.2: libpcap: check release of OS in libpcap.
     tcpdump: fix printing of ethernet header name from /etc/ethers
              when using -e option.

1.1: change timestamp to 100Hz resolution to match kernel.
     fix bug when printing certain tcp headers.
