Sockinfo
</H1>
</CENTER>
sockinfo lets the system administrator or programmer obtain more information
on TCP, UDP, ICMP, RAW, and IGMP protocol control blocks (PCB) in a format 
similar to netstat(TC).  sockinfo identifies and shows:
<UL>
<LI> the process, file descriptor in the process, user, and tty device 
  (if present) associated with the PCB.
<LI> all TCP options (SO_KEEPALIVE, SO_LINGER, etc.) set on the connection.
<LI> TCP external state information like ESTABLISHED or SYN_SENT as well as
  internal state like ISCONNECTED and CANTRCVMORE.
<LI> TCP timers in effect.  You can watch retransmissions, keepalive timers, and
  other timers expire.
<LI> TCP internal parameters (sequence numbers, window sizes, etc.).
<LI> where the last UDP packet was sent to and how long ago that was.
<LI> the route and interface the PCB is currently using.
<LI> when route was added to routing table and how it was added.
<LI> any process sending ICMP packets.
<LI> any process sending RAW packets.
<LI> any process sending IGMP packets (OpenServer 5.0 only)
<LI> lines pertaining to netbios.
<LI> lines pertaining to in-kernel NFS (these are guesses on ODT3.0 but 
  accurate on OpenServer 5.0).
<LI> UNIX domain sockets
<LI> the upstream driver 
(socket for BSD socket programs, timod for TLI programs, 
ktmod for NFS, or netbios)
</UL>
sockinfo can also limit its output to one particular process or PCB and
display the information at fixed intervals for further analysis.
<P>
sockinfo has been compiled for SCO UNIX 3.2.4.2/TCP1.2.1 (ODT3.0, OSES3.0)
as well as Open Server 5.0.
<P>
sockinfo requires read access on /unix and /dev/kmem in order to obtain the
above information.
<P>
Installing sockinfo:
<HR>
sockinfo can be copied into and run from any directory.  Copy sockinfo to 
an appropriate directory (such as /bin or /opt/SCO/TLS/) and type:
<PRE>
# chgrp mem sockinfo
# chmod 2511 sockinfo
</PRE>
This allows any user to run sockinfo without being root.  If you make sockinfo
setuid root users will not be able to use the -h or -n options; these are
reserved for user root.  Note that sockinfo does not need to be setuid root
to work and making sockinfo setgid mem as described above is preferred.
<P>
Running sockinfo:
<HR>
type sockinfo without any arguments to see a usage line.  
<P>
Interpreting sockinfo output:
<HR>
While sockinfo mimics netstat as much as possible, some fields with some
options may be unfamiliar to the user.  When in doubt, grep for the field
name in /usr/include/sys, /usr/include/sys/net, or /usr/include/sys/netinet.
Sockinfo shows fields values literally:  some information such as
dates or aging information may not be correct until data has actually been
sent, or a process may not exist for all PCB's, etc.
<P>
Caveat for -h option on OpenServer 5.0:
<HR>
As root, if you use the -h "hurry" option on OpenServer 5.0 you will obtain more
accurate information if you are concerned with timers or are trying to monitor
a process which is rapidly manipulating/creating connections.  To do this, 
sockinfo will have substantially higher priority than other user processes as 
shown with ps -efl; this will degrade the performance of other runnable 
processes on the machine.  This effect is worse when using the -l "loop" option
since sockinfo will only stop running for the number of "interval" seconds you 
specify.  In fact, with -h -l 0, sockinfo will completely "hog" the CPU and 
prevent nearly all other user processes from running!
To lessen this effect, set the environment variable SOCKINFO_PRIORITY 
to an integer number between 1 and 127 before running sockinfo. 
The value 1 means sockinfo will have a low priority while 127 means that 
sockinfo will have an extremely high priority as far as the scheduler is 
concerned.  You will see the new process priority with ps -efl.
<P>
OpenServer 5.0 note:
<HR>
If a dynamic kernel table size grows while sockinfo is running you may see 
strange behaviour.  restart sockinfo and the problem will disappear.  
I intend to add dynamic table support in a future release.
<P>
The format used to display TCP control block information will be cleaned up 
in a future release.
<P>
For performance reasons, sockinfo will not work if kernel auditing is active.
<P>
Due to licensing restrictions, source for sockinfo is not available.
<P>
I am interested in feedback(good and bad!) as well as any bugs you find.
