<P>
The <DFN>empty target</DFN> is a variant of the phony target; it is used to hold
commands for an action that you request explicitly from time to time.
Unlike a phony target, this target file can really exist; but the file's
contents do not matter, and usually are empty.
<P>
The purpose of the empty target file is to record, with its
last-modification time, when the rule's commands were last executed.  It
does so because one of the commands is a <CODE>touch</CODE> command to update the
target file.
<P>
The empty target file must have some dependencies.  When you ask to remake
the empty target, the commands are executed if any dependency is more
recent than the target; in other words, if a dependency has changed since
the last time you remade the target.  Here is an example:
<P>
<PRE>
print: foo.c bar.c
        lpr -p $?
        touch print
<A NAME="IDX171"></A>
<A NAME="IDX172"></A>
<A NAME="IDX173"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
With this rule, <SAMP>`make print'</SAMP> will execute the <CODE>lpr</CODE> command if
either source file has changed since the last <SAMP>`make print'</SAMP>.  The
automatic variable <SAMP>`$?'</SAMP> is used to print only those files that have
changed (see section <A HREF="make_95.html#SEC94">Automatic Variables</A>).
