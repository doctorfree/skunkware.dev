<P>
You may have noticed that in most of the macro definition examples shown
above, each occurrence of a macro argument name had parentheses around it.
In addition, another pair of parentheses usually surround the entire macro
definition.  Here is why it is best to write macros that way.
<P>
Suppose you define a macro as follows,
<P>
<PRE>
#define ceil_div(x, y) (x + y - 1) / y
</PRE>
<P>
whose purpose is to divide, rounding up.  (One use for this operation is
to compute how many <SAMP>`int'</SAMP> objects are needed to hold a certain
number of <SAMP>`char'</SAMP> objects.)  Then suppose it is used as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
a = ceil_div (b &#38; c, sizeof (int));
</PRE>
<P>
This expands into
<P>
<PRE>
a = (b &#38; c + sizeof (int) - 1) / sizeof (int);
</PRE>
<P>
which does not do what is intended.  The operator-precedence rules of
C make it equivalent to this:
<P>
<PRE>
a = (b &#38; (c + sizeof (int) - 1)) / sizeof (int);
</PRE>
<P>
But what we want is this:
<P>
<PRE>
a = ((b &#38; c) + sizeof (int) - 1)) / sizeof (int);
</PRE>
<P>
Defining the macro as
<P>
<PRE>
#define ceil_div(x, y) ((x) + (y) - 1) / (y)
</PRE>
<P>
provides the desired result.
<P>
However, unintended grouping can result in another way.  Consider
<SAMP>`sizeof ceil_div(1, 2)'</SAMP>.  That has the appearance of a C expression
that would compute the size of the type of <SAMP>`ceil_div (1, 2)'</SAMP>, but in
fact it means something very different.  Here is what it expands to:
<P>
<PRE>
sizeof ((1) + (2) - 1) / (2)
</PRE>
<P>
This would take the size of an integer and divide it by two.  The precedence
rules have put the division outside the <SAMP>`sizeof'</SAMP> when it was intended
to be inside.
<P>
Parentheses around the entire macro definition can prevent such problems.
Here, then, is the recommended way to define <SAMP>`ceil_div'</SAMP>:
<P>
<PRE>
#define ceil_div(x, y) (((x) + (y) - 1) / (y))
</PRE>
<P>
