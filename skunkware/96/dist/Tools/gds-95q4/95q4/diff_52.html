<P>
You can select all unmerged changes from <VAR>older</VAR> to <VAR>yours</VAR> for merging
into <VAR>mine</VAR> with the <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--ed'</SAMP> option.  You can
select only the nonoverlapping unmerged changes with <SAMP>`-3'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--easy-only'</SAMP>, and you can select only the overlapping changes with
<SAMP>`-x'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--overlap-only'</SAMP>.
<P>
The <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-3'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP> options select only
<DFN>unmerged changes</DFN>, i.e. changes where <VAR>mine</VAR> and <VAR>yours</VAR>
differ; they ignore changes from <VAR>older</VAR> to <VAR>yours</VAR> where
<VAR>mine</VAR> and <VAR>yours</VAR> are identical, because they assume that such
changes have already been merged.  If this assumption is not a safe
one, you can use the <SAMP>`-A'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--show-all'</SAMP> option
(see section <A HREF="diff_53.html#SEC53">Marking Conflicts</A>).
<P>
Here is the output of the command <CODE>diff3</CODE> with each of these three
options (see section <A HREF="diff_47.html#SEC47">A Third Sample Input File</A>, for the complete contents of the files).
Notice that <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> outputs the union of the disjoint sets of changes
output by <SAMP>`-3'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP>.
