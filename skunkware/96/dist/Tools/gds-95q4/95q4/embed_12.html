<H3><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="embed_toc.html#TOC12">Compiling on Hitachi H8/300 targets</A></H3>
<P>
The Hitachi H8/300 target family toolchain controls variances in code 
generation directly from the command line.
<P>
When you run <CODE>GCC</CODE>, you can use command-line options to 
choose whether to take advantage of the extra Hitachi H8/300 machine 
instructions, and whether to generate code for hardware or software floating 
point.
<P>
<H3>Using C++ for the Hitachi H8/300</H3>
<P>
This special release includes support for the C++ language.  This
support may in certain circumstances add up to 5K to the size of your
executables.
<P>
The new C++ support involves new startup code that runs C++
initializers before <SAMP>`main()'</SAMP> is invoked.  If you have a replacement for
the file <TT>`crt0.o'</TT> (or if you call <SAMP>`main()'</SAMP> yourself) you must call
<SAMP>`_main()'</SAMP> before calling <SAMP>`main()'</SAMP>.  
<P>
You may need to run these C++ initializers even if you do not write in
C++ yourself.  This could happen, for instance, if you are linking
against a third-party library which itself was written in C++.  You
may not be able to tell that it was written in C++ because you are
calling it with C entry points prototyped in a C header file.  Without
these initializers, functions written in C++ may malfunction.
<P>
If you are not using any third-party libraries, or are otherwise
certain that you will not require any C++ constructors you may
suppress them by adding the following definition to your program:
<P>
<PRE>
  int __main() {}
