<P>
The keyword <CODE>__alignof__</CODE> allows you to inquire about how an object
is aligned, or the minimum alignment usually required by a type.  Its
syntax is just like <CODE>sizeof</CODE>.
<P>
For example, if the target machine requires a <CODE>double</CODE> value to be
aligned on an 8-byte boundary, then <CODE>__alignof__ (double)</CODE> is 8.
This is true on many RISC machines.  On more traditional machine
designs, <CODE>__alignof__ (double)</CODE> is 4 or even 2.
<P>
Some machines never actually require alignment; they allow reference to any
data type even at an odd addresses.  For these machines, <CODE>__alignof__</CODE>
reports the <EM>recommended</EM> alignment of a type.
<P>
When the operand of <CODE>__alignof__</CODE> is an lvalue rather than a type, the
value is the largest alignment that the lvalue is known to have.  It may
have this alignment as a result of its data type, or because it is part of
a structure and inherits alignment from that structure.  For example, after
this declaration:
<P>
<PRE>
struct foo { int x; char y; } foo1;
</PRE>
<P>
the value of <CODE>__alignof__ (foo1.y)</CODE> is probably 2 or 4, the same as
<CODE>__alignof__ (int)</CODE>, even though the data type of <CODE>foo1.y</CODE>
does not itself demand any alignment.<P>
A related feature which lets you specify the alignment of an object is
<CODE>__attribute__ ((aligned (<VAR>alignment</VAR>)))</CODE>; see the following
section.
