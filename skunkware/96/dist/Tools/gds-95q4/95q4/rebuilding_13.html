<H2><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="rebuilding_toc.html#SEC12">The Heterogeneous Updateable Toolkit</A></H2>

<P>
The process described here combines the use of the <SAMP>`--prefix'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`--exec-prefix'</SAMP> options to <CODE>configure</CODE> (see section <A HREF="rebuilding_3.html#SEC2">Options to <CODE>configure</CODE></A>) with the creation of strategic
symbolic links in the installation directory.  See section <A HREF="rebuilding_20.html#SEC19">How your Developer's Kit was built</A>, for an example of this process.

</P>
<P>
In the following examples, the variable <VAR>release</VAR> refers to a given
Cygnus Support release number, such as <SAMP>`progressive-94q4'</SAMP> (many of
the examples simply use <SAMP>`94q4'</SAMP>).  The variable <VAR>hosttype</VAR>
refers to the configure name for the given host type, such as
<SAMP>`sparc-sun-sunos4.1.3'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="rebuilding_4.html#SEC3">Specifying names for hosts and targets</A>).  These values are on the distribution tape
label.

</P>
<P>
In order for the Developer's Kit to be accessible in a heterogeneous
network environment, it must be configured, compiled, and installed on
each <STRONG>host type</STRONG> (one installation for the Sun4s on the network, one
for the DECstations, etc.), using the configuration paradigm discussed
below (for a more general discussion, see section <A HREF="rebuilding_19.html#SEC18">Building and installing the HUT</A>).  The symbolic links must also be
set up on each host.
