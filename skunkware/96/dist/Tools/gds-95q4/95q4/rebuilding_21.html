<H2><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="rebuilding_toc.html#SEC20">Possible build variations</A></H2>

<P>
There are several permutations of variations in building the Cygnus
Support Developer's Kit.  In this section we try to discuss the majority
of the possibilities.  Feel free to contact Cygnus Support with any
questions or problems.

</P>
<P>
In these examples, we assume the source code has been extracted from the
tape into <TT>`/usr/local/src'</TT> on a Sun 4 running SunOS 4.1.3.
Examples are shown using a Bourne-compatible shell (<CODE>sh</CODE>,
<CODE>bash</CODE>, <CODE>ksh</CODE>).  Sample command lines which are too long to
fit on the printed page are wrapped as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/94q4 \
    --exec-prefix=/usr/local/94q4/H-sun4 \
    --srcdir=/usr/local/src
</PRE>

<P>
Such lines are intended to be typed on one single command line.

</P>
<P>
Examples show a <VAR>release</VAR> number of <SAMP>`94q4'</SAMP>, and (often) a
<VAR>hosttype</VAR> of <CODE>sun4</CODE>.  In practice, we recommend the values
<SAMP>`progressive-94q4'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`sparc-sun-sunos4.1.3'</SAMP>, respectively;
see section <A HREF="rebuilding_20.html#SEC19">How your Developer's Kit was built</A>.  The values
are shortened here to make the examples fit on the printed page.

</P>
<P>
The examples also show the creation of two links.  The links aren't
necessary, but they do provide an easy way to make your Developer's Kit
easily updateable and accessible in a heterogeneous environment.

</P>
<P>
The first is a link to make updating easier, so that when you upgrade
the Developer's Kit you only need to switch that link to bring it
online.  The second link allows the creation of several toolkits in a
heterogeneous network; each different host can have a link to the
toolkit configured for the host's architecture and operating system.
See section <A HREF="rebuilding_13.html#SEC12">The Heterogeneous Updateable Toolkit</A>.
