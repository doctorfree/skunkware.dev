<DT><EM>Command Window</EM>
<DD>The command window provides access to the standard GDB command
interpreter.  In nearly all cases, commands typed into this window
behave exactly as for a non-windowing GDB. 

Note that not all changes to GDB are be reflected in this window.
For instance, if you type a <SAMP>`step'</SAMP> command, then click on the
<SAMP>`step'</SAMP> menu item in the source window, then type another
<SAMP>`step'</SAMP> command, the command buffer shows only two steps, although
you have actually done three.  GDB places an ellipsis (...) in
the command buffer when operations in other windows are done, as a
reminder that the command buffer is incomplete.  The command window has
no status line or button box.

<EM>(This example screen is the initial Command Window from the Unix version
of the GDB GUI.)</EM>

<DT><EM>Files Window</EM>
<DD>The Files Window lists all of the files that were used to build the
executable.

Clicking in the bar in the left margin expands/contracts the display of
included files and symbols defined by the file.


<DT><EM>Source Window</EM>
<DD>A source window displays a single file of source code.

The left margin includes an indicator for the current PC, breakpoints
and potential breakpoints, and (optionally) line numbers.
