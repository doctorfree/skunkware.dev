<P>
The C subroutine library depends on a handful of subroutine calls for
operating system services.  If you use the C library on a system that
complies with the POSIX.1 standard (also known as IEEE 1003.1), most of
these subroutines are supplied with your operating system.
<P>
If some of these subroutines are not provided with your system--in
the extreme case, if you are developing software for a "bare board"
system, without an OS--you will at least need to provide do-nothing
stubs (or subroutines with minimal functionality) to allow your
programs to link with the subroutines in <CODE>libc.a</CODE>.
