Here is a summary of the options you can use on the <CODE>ld</CODE> command
line:
<P>

</PRE>
<P>
This plethora of command-line options may seem intimidating, but in
actual practice few of them are used in any particular context.
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
For instance, a frequent use of <CODE>ld</CODE> is to link standard Unix
object files on a standard, supported Unix system.  On such a system, to
link a file <CODE>hello.o</CODE>:
<P>
<PRE>
ld -o <VAR>output</VAR> /lib/crt0.o hello.o -lc
</PRE>
<P>
This tells <CODE>ld</CODE> to produce a file called <VAR>output</VAR> as the
result of linking the file <CODE>/lib/crt0.o</CODE> with <CODE>hello.o</CODE> and
the library <CODE>libc.a</CODE>, which will come from the standard search
directories.  (See the discussion of the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option below.)
<P>
The command-line options to <CODE>ld</CODE> may be specified in any order, and
may be repeated at will.  Repeating most options with a
different argument will either have no further effect, or override prior
occurrences (those further to the left on the command line) of that
option.  
<P>
The exceptions--which may meaningfully be used more than once--are
<SAMP>`-A'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> (or its synonym <SAMP>`-format'</SAMP>), <SAMP>`-defsym'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-L'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-R'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-u'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`-('</SAMP> (or its
synonym <SAMP>`--start-group'</SAMP>)..
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>
<P>
The list of object files to be linked together, shown as <VAR>objfile</VAR>...,
may follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line options, except that
an <VAR>objfile</VAR> argument may not be placed between an option and
its argument.
<P>
Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but you can
specify other forms of binary input files using <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-R'</SAMP>,
and the script command language.  If <EM>no</EM> binary input files at all
are specified, the linker does not produce any output, and issues the
message <SAMP>`No input files'</SAMP>.
<P>
If the linker can not recognize the format of an object file, it will
assume that it is a linker script.  A script specified in this way
augments the main linker script used for the link (either the default
linker script or the one specified by using <SAMP>`-T'</SAMP>).  This feature
permits the linker to link against a file which appears to be an object
or an archive, but actually merely defines some symbol values, or uses
<CODE>INPUT</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP</CODE> to load other objects.  See section <A HREF="ld_5.html#SEC5">Command Language</A>.
<P>
For options whose names are a single letter,
option arguments must either follow the option letter without intervening
whitespace, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the
option that requires them.
<P>
For options whose names are multiple letters, either one dash or two can
precede the option name; for example, <SAMP>`--oformat'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-oformat'</SAMP> are equivalent.  Arguments to multiple-letter options
must either be separated from the option name by an equals sign, or be
given as separate arguments immediately following the option that
requires them.  For example, <SAMP>`--oformat srec'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`--oformat=srec'</SAMP> are equivalent.  Unique abbreviations of the names
of multiple-letter options are accepted.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-A<VAR>architecture</VAR></CODE>
<DD>In the current release of <CODE>ld</CODE>, this option is useful only for the
Intel 960 family of architectures.  In that <CODE>ld</CODE> configuration, the
<VAR>architecture</VAR> argument identifies the particular architecture in
the 960 family, enabling some safeguards and modifying the
archive-library search path.  See section <A HREF="ld_25.html#SEC25"><CODE>ld</CODE> and the Intel 960 family</A>, for details.

Future releases of <CODE>ld</CODE> may support similar functionality for
other architecture families.

<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
<DT><CODE>-b <VAR>input-format</VAR></CODE>
<DD><CODE>ld</CODE> may be configured to support more than one kind of object
file.  If your <CODE>ld</CODE> is configured this way, you can use the
<SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> option to specify the binary format for input object files
that follow this option on the command line.  Even when <CODE>ld</CODE> is
configured to support alternative object formats, you don't usually need
to specify this, as <CODE>ld</CODE> should be configured to expect as a
default input format the most usual format on each machine.
<VAR>input-format</VAR> is a text string, the name of a particular format
supported by the BFD libraries.  (You can list the available binary
formats with <SAMP>`objdump -i'</SAMP>.)  <SAMP>`-format <VAR>input-format</VAR>'</SAMP>
has the same effect, as does the script command <CODE>TARGET</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="ld_26.html#SEC26">BFD</A>.

You may want to use this option if you are linking files with an unusual
binary format.  You can also use <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> to switch formats explicitly (when
linking object files of different formats), by including
<SAMP>`-b <VAR>input-format</VAR>'</SAMP> before each group of object files in a
particular format.  

The default format is taken from the environment variable
<CODE>GNUTARGET</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="ld_4.html#SEC4">Environment Variables</A>.
You can also define the input
format from a script, using the command <CODE>TARGET</CODE>; see section <A HREF="ld_22.html#SEC22">Option Commands</A>.

<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
<DT><CODE>-Bstatic</CODE>
<DD>Do not link against shared libraries.  This is only meaningful on
platforms for which shared libraries are supported.

<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<DT><CODE>-Bdynamic</CODE>
<DD>Link against dynamic libraries.  This is only meaningful on platforms
for which shared libraries are supported.  This option is normally the
default on such platforms.

<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
<DT><CODE>-Bsymbolic</CODE>
<DD>When creating a shared library, bind references to global symbols to the
definition within the shared library, if any.  Normally, it is possible
for a program linked against a shared library to override the definition
within the shared library.  This option is only meaningful on ELF
platforms which support shared libraries.

<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
<DT><CODE>-c <VAR>MRI-commandfile</VAR></CODE>
<DD>For compatibility with linkers produced by MRI, <CODE>ld</CODE> accepts script
files written in an alternate, restricted command language, described in
section <A HREF="ld_30.html#SEC30">MRI Compatible Script Files</A>.  Introduce MRI script files with
the option <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP>; use the <SAMP>`-T'</SAMP> option to run linker
scripts written in the general-purpose <CODE>ld</CODE> scripting language.
If <VAR>MRI-cmdfile</VAR> does not exist, <CODE>ld</CODE> looks for it in the directories
specified by any <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> options.

<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
<DT><CODE>-d</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-dc</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-dp</CODE>
<DD>These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are supported for
compatibility with other linkers.  They
assign space to common symbols even if a relocatable output file is
specified (with <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>).  The script command
<CODE>FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION</CODE> has the same effect.  See section <A HREF="ld_22.html#SEC22">Option Commands</A>.

<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
<DT><CODE>-defsym <VAR>symbol</VAR>=<VAR>expression</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Create a global symbol in the output file, containing the absolute
address given by <VAR>expression</VAR>.  You may use this option as many
times as necessary to define multiple symbols in the command line.  A
limited form of arithmetic is supported for the <VAR>expression</VAR> in this
context: you may give a hexadecimal constant or the name of an existing
symbol, or use <CODE>+</CODE> and <CODE>-</CODE> to add or subtract hexadecimal
constants or symbols.  If you need more elaborate expressions, consider
using the linker command language from a script (see section <A HREF="ld_13.html#SEC13">Assignment: Defining Symbols</A>).  <EM>Note:</EM>  there should be no
white space between <VAR>symbol</VAR>, the equals sign ("<KBD>=</KBD>"), and
<VAR>expression</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
<DT><CODE>-dynamic-linker <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Set the name of the dynamic linker.  This is only meaningful when
generating dynamically linked ELF executables.  The default dynamic
linker is normally correct; don't use this unless you know what you are
doing.

<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
<DT><CODE>-embedded-relocs</CODE>
<DD>This option is only meaningful when linking MIPS embedded PIC code,
generated by the -membedded-pic option to the GNU compiler and
assembler.  It causes the linker to create a table which may be used at
runtime to relocate any data which was statically initialized to pointer
values.  See the code in testsuite/ld-empic for details.

<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
<DT><CODE>-e <VAR>entry</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Use <VAR>entry</VAR> as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your
program, rather than the default entry point. See section <A HREF="ld_21.html#SEC21">The Entry Point</A>, for a
discussion of defaults and other ways of specifying the
entry point.

<A NAME="IDX30"></A>
<DT><CODE>-F</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-F<VAR>format</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Ignored.  Some older linkers used this option throughout a compilation
toolchain for specifying object-file format for both input and output
object files.  The mechanisms <CODE>ld</CODE> uses for this purpose (the
<SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-format'</SAMP> options for input files, <SAMP>`-oformat'</SAMP>
option or the <CODE>TARGET</CODE> command in linker scripts for output files,
the <CODE>GNUTARGET</CODE> environment variable) are more flexible, but
<CODE>ld</CODE> accepts the <SAMP>`-F'</SAMP> option for compatibility with scripts
written to call the old linker.

<A NAME="IDX31"></A>
<DT><CODE>-format <VAR>input-format</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Synonym for <SAMP>`-b <VAR>input-format</VAR>'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX32"></A>
<DT><CODE>-g</CODE>
<DD>Ignored.  Provided for compatibility with other tools.

<A NAME="IDX34"></A>
<A NAME="IDX33"></A>
<DT><CODE>-G<VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-G <VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP register to
<VAR>size</VAR> under MIPS ECOFF.  Ignored for other object file formats.

<A NAME="IDX36"></A>
<A NAME="IDX37"></A>
<A NAME="IDX35"></A>
<DT><CODE>-help</CODE>
<DD>Print a summary of the command-line options on the standard output and exit.

<A NAME="IDX39"></A>
<A NAME="IDX38"></A>
<DT><CODE>-i</CODE>
<DD>Perform an incremental link (same as option <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>).

<A NAME="IDX41"></A>
<A NAME="IDX40"></A>
<DT><CODE>-l<VAR>ar</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Add archive file <VAR>archive</VAR> to the list of files to link.  This 
option may be used any number of times.  <CODE>ld</CODE> will search its
path-list for occurrences of <CODE>lib<VAR>ar</VAR>.a</CODE> for every <VAR>archive</VAR>
specified.

<A NAME="IDX43"></A>
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>
<DT><CODE>-L<VAR>searchdir</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-L <VAR>searchdir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Add path <VAR>searchdir</VAR> to the list of paths that <CODE>ld</CODE> will search
for archive libraries and <CODE>ld</CODE> control scripts.  You may use this
option any number of times.

The default set of paths searched (without being specified with
<SAMP>`-L'</SAMP>) depends on which emulation mode <CODE>ld</CODE> is using, and in
some cases also on how it was configured.  See section <A HREF="ld_4.html#SEC4">Environment Variables</A>.

The paths can also be specified in a link script with the
<CODE>SEARCH_DIR</CODE> command.

<A NAME="IDX45"></A>
<A NAME="IDX44"></A>
<DT><CODE>-M</CODE>
<DD>Print (to the standard output) a link map--diagnostic information
about where symbols are mapped by <CODE>ld</CODE>, and information on global
common storage allocation.

<A NAME="IDX47"></A>
<A NAME="IDX46"></A>
<DT><CODE>-Map <VAR>mapfile</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Print to the file <VAR>mapfile</VAR> a link map--diagnostic information
about where symbols are mapped by <CODE>ld</CODE>, and information on global
common storage allocation.

<A NAME="IDX49"></A>
<A NAME="IDX48"></A>
<DT><CODE>-m<VAR>emulation</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-m <VAR>emulation</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Emulate the <VAR>emulation</VAR> linker.  You can list the available
emulations with the <SAMP>`--verbose'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-V'</SAMP> options.  The default
depends on how your <CODE>ld</CODE> was configured.

<A NAME="IDX51"></A>
<A NAME="IDX52"></A>
<A NAME="IDX50"></A>
<DT><CODE>-N</CODE>
<DD>Set the text and data sections to be readable and writable.  Also, do
not page-align the data segment.  If the output format supports Unix
style magic numbers, mark the output as <CODE>OMAGIC</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX54"></A>
<A NAME="IDX55"></A>
<A NAME="IDX53"></A>
<DT><CODE>-n</CODE>
<DD>Set the text segment to be read only, and mark the output as
<CODE>NMAGIC</CODE> if possible.

<A NAME="IDX57"></A>
<A NAME="IDX56"></A>
<DT><CODE>-noinhibit-exec</CODE>
<DD>Retain the executable output file whenever it is still usable.
Normally, the linker will not produce an output file if it encounters
errors during the link process; it exits without writing an output file
when it issues any error whatsoever.

<A NAME="IDX59"></A>
<A NAME="IDX58"></A>
<DT><CODE>-no-keep-memory</CODE>
<DD><CODE>ld</CODE> normally optimizes for speed over memory usage by caching the
symbol tables of input files in memory.  This option tells <CODE>ld</CODE> to
instead optimize for memory usage, by rereading the symbol tables as
necessary.  This may be required if <CODE>ld</CODE> runs out of memory space
while linking a large executable.

<A NAME="IDX61"></A>
<A NAME="IDX60"></A>
<DT><CODE>-o <VAR>output</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Use <VAR>output</VAR> as the name for the program produced by <CODE>ld</CODE>; if this
option is not specified, the name <TT>`a.out'</TT> is used by default.  The
script command <CODE>OUTPUT</CODE> can also specify the output file name.

<A NAME="IDX62"></A>
<DT><CODE>-oformat <VAR>output-format</VAR></CODE>
<DD><CODE>ld</CODE> may be configured to support more than one kind of object
file.  If your <CODE>ld</CODE> is configured this way, you can use the
<SAMP>`-oformat'</SAMP> option to specify the binary format for the output
object file.  Even when <CODE>ld</CODE> is configured to support alternative
object formats, you don't usually need to specify this, as <CODE>ld</CODE>
should be configured to produce as a default output format the most
usual format on each machine.  <VAR>output-format</VAR> is a text string, the
name of a particular format supported by the BFD libraries.  (You can
list the available binary formats with <SAMP>`objdump -i'</SAMP>.)  The script
command <CODE>OUTPUT_FORMAT</CODE> can also specify the output format, but
this option overrides it.  See section <A HREF="ld_26.html#SEC26">BFD</A>.

<A NAME="IDX64"></A>
<A NAME="IDX63"></A>
<DT><CODE>-R <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Read symbol names and their addresses from <VAR>filename</VAR>, but do not
relocate it or include it in the output.  This allows your output file
to refer symbolically to absolute locations of memory defined in other
programs.
 
<A NAME="IDX66"></A>
<A NAME="IDX67"></A>
<A NAME="IDX65"></A>
<DT><CODE>-relax</CODE>
<DD>An option with machine dependent effects.  
Currently this option is only supported on the H8/300 and the Intel 960.
See section <A HREF="ld_24.html#SEC24"><CODE>ld</CODE> and the H8/300</A>.
See section <A HREF="ld_25.html#SEC25"><CODE>ld</CODE> and the Intel 960 family</A>.

On some platforms, the <SAMP>`-relax'</SAMP> option performs global optimizations that
become possible when the linker resolves addressing in the program, such
as relaxing address modes and synthesizing new instructions in the
output object file.  

On platforms where this is not supported, <SAMP>`-relax'</SAMP> is accepted, but
ignored.

<A NAME="IDX69"></A>
<A NAME="IDX70"></A>
<A NAME="IDX68"></A>
<DT><CODE>-retain-symbols-file <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Retain <EM>only</EM> the symbols listed in the file <VAR>filename</VAR>,
discarding all others.  <VAR>filename</VAR> is simply a flat file, with one
symbol name per line.  This option is especially useful in environments
(such as VxWorks)
where a large global symbol table is accumulated gradually, to conserve
run-time memory.

<SAMP>`-retain-symbols-file'</SAMP> does <EM>not</EM> discard undefined symbols,
or symbols needed for relocations.

You may only specify <SAMP>`-retain-symbols-file'</SAMP> once in the command
line.  It overrides <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-S'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX72"></A>
<A NAME="IDX71"></A>
<DT><CODE>-rpath <VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Add a directory to the runtime library search path.  This is only
meaningful when linking an ELF executable with shared objects.  All
-rpath arguments are concatenated and passed to the runtime linker,
which uses them to locate shared objects at runtime.

<A NAME="IDX74"></A>
<A NAME="IDX75"></A>
<A NAME="IDX73"></A>
<DT><CODE>-r</CODE>
<DD>Generate relocatable output--i.e., generate an output file that can in
turn serve as input to <CODE>ld</CODE>.  This is often called <DFN>partial
linking</DFN>.  As a side effect, in environments that support standard Unix
magic numbers, this option also sets the output file's magic number to
<CODE>OMAGIC</CODE>.
If this option is not specified, an absolute file is produced.  When
linking C++ programs, this option <EM>will not</EM> resolve references to
constructors; to do that, use <SAMP>`-Ur'</SAMP>.

This option does the same thing as <SAMP>`-i'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX77"></A>
<A NAME="IDX76"></A>
<DT><CODE>-S</CODE>
<DD>Omit debugger symbol information (but not all symbols) from the output file.

<A NAME="IDX79"></A>
<A NAME="IDX78"></A>
<DT><CODE>-s</CODE>
<DD>Omit all symbol information from the output file.

<A NAME="IDX81"></A>
<A NAME="IDX80"></A>
<DT><CODE>-soname <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_SONAME field to
the specified name.  When an executable is linked with a shared object
which has a DT_SONAME field, then when the executable is run the dynamic
linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by the DT_SONAME
field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.

<A NAME="IDX82"></A>
<A NAME="IDX83"></A>
<DT><CODE>-shared</CODE>
<DD>Create a shared library.  This is currently only supported on ELF
platforms.

<A NAME="IDX84"></A>
<DT><CODE>-sort-common</CODE>
<DD>Normally, when <CODE>ld</CODE> places the global common symbols in the
appropriate output sections, it sorts them by size.  First come all the
one byte symbols, then all the two bytes, then all the four bytes, and
then everything else.  This is to prevent gaps between symbols due to
alignment constraints.  This option disables that sorting.

<A NAME="IDX85"></A>
<DT><CODE>-split-by-reloc <VAR>count</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Trys to creates extra sections in the output file so that no single output section
in the file contains more than <VAR>count</VAR> relocations.  This
is useful when generating huge relocatable for downloading into
certain real time kernels with the COFF object file format; since
COFF cannot represent more than 65535 relocations in a single section.
Note that this will fail to work with object file formats which do not
support arbitrary sections.  The linker will not split up individual input
sections for redistribution,  so if a single input section contains
more than <VAR>count</VAR> relocations one output section will contain that
many relocations.

<A NAME="IDX86"></A>
<DT><CODE>-split-by-file</CODE>
<DD>Similar to -split-by-reloc but creates a new output section for each
input file.

<DT><CODE>-stats</CODE>
<DD>Compute and display statistics about the operation of the linker,
such as execution time and memory usage.

<A NAME="IDX88"></A>
<A NAME="IDX89"></A>
<A NAME="IDX90"></A>
<A NAME="IDX87"></A>
<DT><CODE>-Tbss <VAR>org</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-Tdata <VAR>org</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-Ttext <VAR>org</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Use <VAR>org</VAR> as the starting address for--respectively--the
<CODE>bss</CODE>, <CODE>data</CODE>, or the <CODE>text</CODE> segment of the output file.
<VAR>org</VAR> must be a single hexadecimal integer;
for compatibility with other linkers, you may omit the leading
<SAMP>`0x'</SAMP> usually associated with hexadecimal values.

<A NAME="IDX92"></A>
<A NAME="IDX91"></A>
<DT><CODE>-T <VAR>commandfile</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-T<VAR>commandfile</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Read link commands from the file <VAR>commandfile</VAR>.  These commands
replace <CODE>ld</CODE>'s default link script (rather than adding
to it), so <VAR>commandfile</VAR> must specify everything necessary to describe
the target format.  See section <A HREF="ld_5.html#SEC5">Command Language</A>.  If <VAR>commandfile</VAR> does not
exist, <CODE>ld</CODE> looks for it in the directories specified by any
preceding <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> options.  Multiple <SAMP>`-T'</SAMP> options accumulate.

<A NAME="IDX94"></A>
<A NAME="IDX95"></A>
<A NAME="IDX93"></A>
<DT><CODE>-t</CODE>
<DD>Print the names of the input files as <CODE>ld</CODE> processes them.

<A NAME="IDX97"></A>
<A NAME="IDX96"></A>
<DT><CODE>-traditional-format</CODE>
<DD>For some targets, the output of <CODE>ld</CODE> is different in some ways from
the output of some existing linker.  This switch requests <CODE>ld</CODE> to
use the traditional format instead.

<A NAME="IDX98"></A>
For example, on SunOS, <CODE>ld</CODE> combines duplicate entries in the
symbol string table.  This can reduce the size of an output file with
full debugging information by over 30 percent.  Unfortunately, the SunOS
<CODE>dbx</CODE> program can not read the resulting program (<CODE>gdb</CODE> has no
trouble).  The <SAMP>`-traditional-format'</SAMP> switch tells <CODE>ld</CODE> to not
combine duplicate entries.

<A NAME="IDX100"></A>
<A NAME="IDX99"></A>
<DT><CODE>-u <VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Force <VAR>symbol</VAR> to be entered in the output file as an undefined symbol.
Doing this may, for example, trigger linking of additional modules from
standard libraries.  <SAMP>`-u'</SAMP> may be repeated with different option
arguments to enter additional undefined symbols.

<A NAME="IDX102"></A>
<A NAME="IDX101"></A>
<DT><CODE>-Ur</CODE>
<DD>For anything other than C++ programs, this option is equivalent to
<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>: it generates relocatable output--i.e., an output file that can in
turn serve as input to <CODE>ld</CODE>.  When linking C++ programs, <SAMP>`-Ur'</SAMP>
<EM>does</EM> resolve references to constructors, unlike <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>.
It does not work to use <SAMP>`-Ur'</SAMP> on files that were themselves linked
with <SAMP>`-Ur'</SAMP>; once the constructor table has been built, it cannot
be added to.  Use <SAMP>`-Ur'</SAMP> only for the last partial link, and
<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> for the others.

<A NAME="IDX104"></A>
<A NAME="IDX103"></A>
<DT><CODE>--verbose</CODE>
<DD>Display the version number for <CODE>ld</CODE> and list the linker emulations
supported.  Display which input files can and cannot be opened.

<A NAME="IDX106"></A>
<A NAME="IDX107"></A>
<A NAME="IDX105"></A>
<DT><CODE>-v</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-V</CODE>
<DD>Display the version number for <CODE>ld</CODE>.  The <CODE>-V</CODE> option also
lists the supported emulations.

<A NAME="IDX108"></A>
<DT><CODE>-version</CODE>
<DD>Display the version number for <CODE>ld</CODE> and exit.

<A NAME="IDX110"></A>
<A NAME="IDX111"></A>
<A NAME="IDX109"></A>
<DT><CODE>-warn-common</CODE>
<DD>Warn when a common symbol is combined with another common symbol or with
a symbol definition.  Unix linkers allow this somewhat sloppy practice,
but linkers on some other operating systems do not.  This option allows
you to find potential problems from combining global symbols.
Unfortunately, some C libraries use this practice, so you may get some
warnings about symbols in the libraries as well as in your programs.

There are three kinds of global symbols, illustrated here by C examples:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`int i = 1;'</SAMP>
<DD>A definition, which goes in the initialized data section of the output
file.

<DT><SAMP>`extern int i;'</SAMP>
<DD>An undefined reference, which does not allocate space.
There must be either a definition or a common symbol for the
variable somewhere.

<DT><SAMP>`int i;'</SAMP>
<DD>A common symbol.  If there are only (one or more) common symbols for a
variable, it goes in the uninitialized data area of the output file.
The linker merges multiple common symbols for the same variable into a
single symbol.  If they are of different sizes, it picks the largest
size.  The linker turns a common symbol into a declaration, if there is
a definition of the same variable.
</DL>

The <SAMP>`-warn-common'</SAMP> option can produce five kinds of warnings.  Each
warning consists of a pair of lines: the first describes the symbol just
encountered, and the second describes the previous symbol encountered
with the same name.  One or both of the two symbols will be a common
symbol.

<OL>
<DT><CODE></CODE>
<DD>Turning a common symbol into a reference, because there is already a
definition for the symbol.
<PRE>
<VAR>file</VAR>(<VAR>section</VAR>): warning: common of `<VAR>symbol</VAR>'
   overridden by definition
<VAR>file</VAR>(<VAR>section</VAR>): warning: defined here
</PRE>

<DT><CODE></CODE>
<DD>Turning a common symbol into a reference, because a later definition for
the symbol is encountered.  This is the same as the previous case,
except that the symbols are encountered in a different order.
<PRE>
<VAR>file</VAR>(<VAR>section</VAR>): warning: definition of `<VAR>symbol</VAR>'
   overriding common
<VAR>file</VAR>(<VAR>section</VAR>): warning: common is here
</PRE>

<DT><CODE></CODE>
<DD>Merging a common symbol with a previous same-sized common symbol.
<PRE>
<VAR>file</VAR>(<VAR>section</VAR>): warning: multiple common
   of `<VAR>symbol</VAR>'
<VAR>file</VAR>(<VAR>section</VAR>): warning: previous common is here
</PRE>

<DT><CODE></CODE>
<DD>Merging a common symbol with a previous larger common symbol.
<PRE>
<VAR>file</VAR>(<VAR>section</VAR>): warning: common of `<VAR>symbol</VAR>'
   overridden by larger common
<VAR>file</VAR>(<VAR>section</VAR>): warning: larger common is here
</PRE>

<DT><CODE></CODE>
<DD>Merging a common symbol with a previous smaller common symbol.  This is
the same as the previous case, except that the symbols are
encountered in a different order.
<PRE>
<VAR>file</VAR>(<VAR>section</VAR>): warning: common of `<VAR>symbol</VAR>'
   overriding smaller common
<VAR>file</VAR>(<VAR>section</VAR>): warning: smaller common is here
</PRE>
</OL>

<A NAME="IDX112"></A>
<DT><CODE>-warn-constructors</CODE>
<DD>Warn if any global constructors are used.  This is only useful for a few
object file formats.  For formats like COFF or ELF, the linker can not
detect the use of global constructors.

<A NAME="IDX114"></A>
<A NAME="IDX115"></A>
<A NAME="IDX113"></A>
<DT><CODE>-warn-once</CODE>
<DD>Only warn once for each undefined symbol, rather than once per module
which refers to it.

<A NAME="IDX117"></A>
<A NAME="IDX116"></A>
For each archive mentioned on the command line, include every object
file in the archive in the link, rather than searching the archive for
the required object files.  This is normally used to turn an archive
file into a shared library, forcing every object to be included in the
resulting shared library.

<A NAME="IDX119"></A>
<A NAME="IDX120"></A>
<A NAME="IDX118"></A>
<DT><CODE>-X</CODE>
<DD>Delete all temporary local symbols.  For most targets, this is all local
symbols whose names begin with <SAMP>`L'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
<A NAME="IDX121"></A>
<DT><CODE>-x</CODE>
<DD>Delete all local symbols.

<A NAME="IDX124"></A>
<A NAME="IDX123"></A>
<DT><CODE>-y <VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Print the name of each linked file in which <VAR>symbol</VAR> appears.  This
option may be given any number of times.  On many systems it is necessary
to prepend an underscore.

This option is useful when you have an undefined symbol in your link but
don't know where the reference is coming from.

<A NAME="IDX126"></A>
<A NAME="IDX125"></A>
<DT><CODE>-( <VAR>archives</VAR> -)</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>--start-group <VAR>archives</VAR> --end-group</CODE>
<DD>The <VAR>archives</VAR> should be a list of archive files.  They may be
either explicit file names, or <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> options.

The specified archives are searched repeatedly until no new undefined
references are created.  Normally, an archive is searched only once in
the order that it is specified on the command line.  If a symbol in that
archive is needed to resolve an undefined symbol referred to by an
object in an archive that appears later on the command line, the linker
would not be able to resolve that reference.  By grouping the archives,
they all be searched repeatedly until all possible references are
resolved.

Using this option has a significant performance cost.  It is best to use
it only when there are unavoidable circular references between two or
more archives.
