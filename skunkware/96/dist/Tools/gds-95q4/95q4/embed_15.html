<P>
The first three words of arguments are passed in registers <SAMP>`R0'</SAMP>
through <SAMP>`R2'</SAMP>.  All remaining arguments are pushed onto the stack,
last to first, so that the lowest numbered argument not passed in a
register is at the lowest address in the stack.  The registers are
always filled, so a double word argument starting in <SAMP>`R2'</SAMP> would
have the most significant word in <SAMP>`R2'</SAMP> and the least significant
word on the stack.
<P>
When a function is compiled with the default options, it must return
with registers <SAMP>`R3'</SAMP> through <SAMP>`R6'</SAMP> unchanged.  Registers
<SAMP>`R0'</SAMP> through <SAMP>`R2'</SAMP> are
volatile.
<P>
Note that functions compiled with different calling conventions cannot
be run together without some care.
