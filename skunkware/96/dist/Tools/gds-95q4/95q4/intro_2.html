These manuals may be included in a hardcopy format in this Cygnus

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CITE>GNU gprof</CITE>

<P>

<P>
You have the freedom to copy the manuals, like the software they cover;
each manual's copyright statement includes the necessary permissions.
The manuals themselves are also free software, and the source code for
them is also available on the tape.
<P>
<H3>Conventions</H3>
<P>
Our manuals use these conventions to help you distinguish commands,
filenames, and other program-specific objects from the descriptive text.
 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>Typewriter-text</CODE>
<DD>Indicates text that is a literal example of a piece of a program, such
as environmental variable names like <CODE>EDITOR</CODE>. It will also
indicate keyboard characters you should type, or other literal bits of
text from a program, such as filenames or examples.

<DT><KBD>key-name</KBD>
<DD>Indicates the conventional name for a special key on a keyboard, such as
<KBD>RET</KBD> or <KBD>DEL</KBD>.

<DT><VAR>generic-name</VAR>
<DD>Stands for another piece of text. For example, in the command
description "To delete the file named <VAR>filename</VAR>, type <CODE>rm
<VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>."  <VAR>filename</VAR> stands for the file you want to
delete, no matter what you've named it.
