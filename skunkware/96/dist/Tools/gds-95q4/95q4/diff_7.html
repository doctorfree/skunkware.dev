<P>
To ignore insertions and deletions of lines that match a regular
expression, use the <SAMP>`-I <VAR>regexp</VAR>'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--ignore-matching-lines=<VAR>regexp</VAR>'</SAMP> option.  You should escape
regular expressions that contain shell metacharacters to prevent the
shell from expanding them.  For example, <SAMP>`diff -I '^[0-9]''</SAMP> ignores
all changes to lines beginning with a digit.
<P>
However, <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> only ignores the insertion or deletion of lines that
contain the regular expression if every changed line in the hunk--every
insertion and every deletion--matches the regular expression.  In other
words, for each nonignorable change, <CODE>diff</CODE> prints the complete set
of changes in its vicinity, including the ignorable ones.
<P>
You can specify more than one regular expression for lines to ignore by
using more than one <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> option.  <CODE>diff</CODE> tries to match each
line against each regular expression, starting with the last one given.
