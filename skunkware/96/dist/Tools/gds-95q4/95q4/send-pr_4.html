<P>
The format of a PR is designed to reflect the nature of PRMS as a
database.  Information is arranged into <DFN>fields</DFN>, and kept in
individual records (Problem Reports).
<P>
Problem Report fields are denoted by a keyword which begins with
<SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP> and ends with <SAMP>`:'</SAMP>, as in <SAMP>`&#62;Confidential:'</SAMP>.  Fields
belong to one of three data types:
<P>
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>ENUMERATED
<DD>One of a specific set of values, which vary according to the field.  The
value for each keyword must be on the same line as the keyword.  These
values are not configurable (yet).

For each ENUMERATED keyword, the possible choices are listed in the
<CODE>send-pr</CODE> template as a comment.
The following fields are ENUMERATED format; see the descriptions of
fields below for explanations of each field in detail:

<PRE>
&#62;Confidential:   &#62;Severity:       &#62;Priority:
&#62;Class:          &#62;State:          &#62;Number:
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
<DT>TEXT
<DD>One single line of text which must begin and end on the same line (i.e.,
before a newline) as the keyword.  See the descriptions of fields below
for explanations of each field in detail.  The following fields are
TEXT format:

<PRE>
&#62;Submitter-Id:   &#62;Originator:     &#62;Synopsis:
&#62;Category:       &#62;Release:        &#62;Responsible:
&#62;Arrival-Date:
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
<DT>MULTITEXT
<DD>Text of any length may occur in this field.  MULTITEXT may span
multiple lines and may also include blank lines.  A MULTITEXT field
ends only when another keyword appears.  See the descriptions of fields
below for explanations of each field in detail.  

The following fields are MULTITEXT format:

<PRE>
&#62;Organization:   &#62;Environment:    &#62;Description:
&#62;How-To-Repeat:  &#62;Fix:            &#62;Audit-Trail:
&#62;Unformatted:
</PRE>

</DL>
<P>
A Problem Report contains two different types of fields: <DFN>Mail
Header</DFN> fields, which are used by the mail handler for delivery, and
<DFN>Problem Report</DFN> fields, which contain information relevant to the
Problem Report and its submitter.  A Problem Report is essentially a
specially formatted electronic mail message.
<P>
The following is an example Problem Report.  Mail headers are at the
top, followed by PRMS fields, which begin with <SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP> and end
with <SAMP>`:'</SAMP>.  The <SAMP>`Subject:'</SAMP> line in the mail header and the
<SAMP>`&#62;Synopsis:'</SAMP> field are usually duplicates of each other.
