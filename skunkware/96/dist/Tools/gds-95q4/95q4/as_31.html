A <DFN>string</DFN> is written between double-quotes.  It may contain
double-quotes or null characters.  The way to get special characters
into a string is to <DFN>escape</DFN> these characters: precede them with
a backslash <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> character.  For example <SAMP>`\\'</SAMP> represents
one backslash:  the first <CODE>\</CODE> is an escape which tells
<CODE>as</CODE> to interpret the second character literally as a backslash
(which prevents <CODE>as</CODE> from recognizing the second <CODE>\</CODE> as an
escape character).  The complete list of escapes follows.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><KBD>\b</KBD>
<DD>Mnemonic for backspace; for ASCII this is octal code 010.

<A NAME="IDX120"></A>
<A NAME="IDX119"></A>
<DT><KBD>\f</KBD>
<DD>Mnemonic for FormFeed; for ASCII this is octal code 014.

<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
<A NAME="IDX121"></A>
<DT><KBD>\n</KBD>
<DD>Mnemonic for newline; for ASCII this is octal code 012.

<A NAME="IDX124"></A>
<A NAME="IDX123"></A>
<DT><KBD>\r</KBD>
<DD>Mnemonic for carriage-Return; for ASCII this is octal code 015.

<A NAME="IDX126"></A>
<A NAME="IDX125"></A>
<DT><KBD>\t</KBD>
<DD>Mnemonic for horizontal Tab; for ASCII this is octal code 011.

<A NAME="IDX128"></A>
<A NAME="IDX127"></A>
<DT><KBD>\ <VAR>digit</VAR> <VAR>digit</VAR> <VAR>digit</VAR></KBD>
<DD>An octal character code.  The numeric code is 3 octal digits.
For compatibility with other Unix systems, 8 and 9 are accepted as digits:
for example, <CODE>\008</CODE> has the value 010, and <CODE>\009</CODE> the value 011.

<A NAME="IDX130"></A>
<A NAME="IDX129"></A>
<DT><KBD>\<CODE>x</CODE> <VAR>hex-digit</VAR> <VAR>hex-digit</VAR></KBD>
<DD>A hex character code.  The numeric code is 2 hexadecimal digits.  Either
upper or lower case <CODE>x</CODE> works.

<A NAME="IDX132"></A>
<A NAME="IDX131"></A>
<DT><KBD>\\</KBD>
<DD>Represents one <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> character.

<A NAME="IDX134"></A>
<A NAME="IDX133"></A>
<DT><KBD>\"</KBD>
<DD>Represents one <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> character.  Needed in strings to represent
this character, because an unescaped <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> would end the string.

<DT><KBD>\ <VAR>anything-else</VAR></KBD>
<DD>Any other character when escaped by <KBD>\</KBD> gives a warning, but
assembles as if the <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> was not present.  The idea is that if
you used an escape sequence you clearly didn't want the literal
interpretation of the following character.  However <CODE>as</CODE> has no
other interpretation, so <CODE>as</CODE> knows it is giving you the wrong
code and warns you of the fact.
</DL>
<P>
Which characters are escapable, and what those escapes represent,
varies widely among assemblers.  The current set is what we think
the BSD 4.2 assembler recognizes, and is a subset of what most C
compilers recognize.  If you are in doubt, do not use an escape
sequence.
