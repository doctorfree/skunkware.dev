<P>
If <CODE>make</CODE> gets a fatal signal while a command is executing, it may
delete the target file that the command was supposed to update.  This is
done if the target file's last-modification time has changed since
<CODE>make</CODE> first checked it.
<P>
The purpose of deleting the target is to make sure that it is remade from
scratch when <CODE>make</CODE> is next run.  Why is this?  Suppose you type
<KBD>Ctrl-c</KBD> while a compiler is running, and it has begun to write an
object file <TT>`foo.o'</TT>.  The <KBD>Ctrl-c</KBD> kills the compiler, resulting
in an incomplete file whose last-modification time is newer than the source
file <TT>`foo.c'</TT>.  But <CODE>make</CODE> also receives the <KBD>Ctrl-c</KBD> signal
and deletes this incomplete file.  If <CODE>make</CODE> did not do this, the next
invocation of <CODE>make</CODE> would think that <TT>`foo.o'</TT> did not require
updating--resulting in a strange error message from the linker when it
tries to link an object file half of which is missing.
<A NAME="IDX294"></A>
<P>
You can prevent the deletion of a target file in this way by making the
special target <CODE>.PRECIOUS</CODE> depend on it.  Before remaking a target,
<CODE>make</CODE> checks to see whether it appears on the dependencies of
<CODE>.PRECIOUS</CODE>, and thereby decides whether the target should be deleted
if a signal happens.  Some reasons why you might do this are that the
target is updated in some atomic fashion, or exists only to record a
modification-time (its contents do not matter), or must exist at all
times to prevent other sorts of trouble.
