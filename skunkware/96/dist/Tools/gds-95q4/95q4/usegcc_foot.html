Prior to release 2 of the compiler,
there was a separate <CODE>g++</CODE> compiler.  That version was based on GNU
CC, but not integrated with it.  Versions of <CODE>g++</CODE> with a
<SAMP>`1.<VAR>xx</VAR>'</SAMP> version number--for example, <CODE>g++</CODE> version 1.37
or 1.42--are much less reliable than the versions integrated with <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.  Moreover, combining G++ <SAMP>`1.<VAR>xx</VAR>'</SAMP> with a version 2 <CODE>gcc</CODE> will
simply not work.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="usegcc_60.html#REF2">(2)</A></H3>
The analogous feature in
Fortran is called an assigned goto, but that name seems inappropriate in
C, where one can do more than simply store label addresses in label
variables.

A file's <DFN>basename</DFN>
was the name stripped of all leading path information and of trailing
suffixes, such as <SAMP>`.h'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`.C'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`.cc'</SAMP>.
