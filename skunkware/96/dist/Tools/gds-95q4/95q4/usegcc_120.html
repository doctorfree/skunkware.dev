<P>
GNU CC needs to install corrected versions of some system header files.
This is because most target systems have some header files that won't
work with GNU CC unless they are changed.  Some have bugs, some are
incompatible with ANSI C, and some depend on special features of other
compilers.
<P>
Installing GNU CC automatically creates and installs the fixed header
files, by running a program called <CODE>fixincludes</CODE> (or for certain
targets an alternative such as <CODE>fixinc.svr4</CODE>).  Normally, you
don't need to pay attention to this.  But there are cases where it
doesn't do the right thing automatically.

If you update the system's header files, such as by installing a new
system version, the fixed header files of GNU CC are not automatically
updated.  The easiest way to update them is to reinstall GNU CC.  (If
you want to be clever, look in the makefile and you can find a
shortcut.)

<LI>
On some systems, in particular SunOS 4, header file directories contain
machine-specific symbolic links in certain places.  This makes it
possible to share most of the header files among hosts running the
same version of SunOS 4 on different machine models.

The programs that fix the header files do not understand this special
way of using symbolic links; therefore, the directory of fixed header
files is good only for the machine model used to build it.

In SunOS 4, only programs that look inside the kernel will notice the
difference between machine models.  Therefore, for most purposes, you
need not be concerned about this.

It is possible to make separate sets of fixed header files for the
different machine models, and arrange a structure of symbolic links so
as to use the proper set, but you'll have to do this by hand.

<LI>
On Lynxos, GNU CC by default does not fix the header files.  This is
because bugs in the shell cause the <CODE>fixincludes</CODE> script to fail.

This means you will encounter problems due to bugs in the system header
files.  It may be no comfort that they aren't GNU CC's fault, but it
does mean that there's nothing for us to do about them.
