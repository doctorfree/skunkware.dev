<P>
The <CODE>diff3</CODE> command compares three files and outputs descriptions
of their differences.  Its arguments are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
diff3 <VAR>options</VAR>... <VAR>mine</VAR> <VAR>older</VAR> <VAR>yours</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
The files to compare are <VAR>mine</VAR>, <VAR>older</VAR>, and <VAR>yours</VAR>.
At most one of these three file names may be <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>,
which tells <CODE>diff3</CODE> to read the standard input for that file.
<P>
An exit status of 0 means <CODE>diff3</CODE> was successful, 1 means some
conflicts were found, and 2 means trouble.
