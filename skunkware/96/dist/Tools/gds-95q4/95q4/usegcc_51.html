<TITLE>Using GNU CC - Cross Headers</TITLE>

<P>
If you are cross-compiling a standalone program or a program for an
embedded system, then you may not need any header files except the few
that are part of GNU CC (and those of your program).  However, if you
intend to link your program with a standard C library such as
<TT>`libc.a'</TT>, then you probably need to compile with the header files
that go with the library you use.
<P>
The GNU C compiler does not come with these files, because (1) they are
system-specific, and (2) they belong in a C library, not in a compiler.
<P>
If the GNU C library supports your target machine, then you can get the
header files from there (assuming you actually use the GNU library when
you link your program).
<P>
If your target machine comes with a C compiler, it probably comes with
suitable header files also.  If you make these files accessible from the host
machine, the cross-compiler can use them also.
<P>
Otherwise, you're on your own in finding header files to use when
cross-compiling.
<P>
When you have found suitable header files, put them in
<TT>`/usr/local/<VAR>target</VAR>/include'</TT>, before building the cross
compiler.  Then installation will run fixincludes properly and install
the corrected versions of the header files where the compiler will use
them.
<P>
Provide the header files before you build the cross-compiler, because
the build stage actually runs the cross-compiler to produce parts of
<TT>`libgcc.a'</TT>.  (These are the parts that <EM>can</EM> be compiled with
GNU CC.)  Some of them need suitable header files.
<P>
Here's an example showing how to copy the header files from a target
machine.  On the target machine, do this:
<P>
<PRE>
(cd /usr/include; tar cf - .) &#62; tarfile
</PRE>
<P>
Then, on the host machine, do this:
<P>
<PRE>
ftp <VAR>target-machine</VAR>
lcd /usr/local/<VAR>target</VAR>/include
get tarfile
quit
tar xf tarfile
</PRE>
