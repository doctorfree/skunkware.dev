<P>
GNU <CODE>diff</CODE> runs quite efficiently; however, in some circumstances
you can cause it to run faster or produce a more compact set of changes.
There are two ways that you can affect the performance of GNU
<CODE>diff</CODE> by changing the way it compares files.
<P>
Performance has more than one dimension.  These options improve one
aspect of performance at the cost of another, or they improve
performance in some cases while hurting it in others.
<P>
The way that GNU <CODE>diff</CODE> determines which lines have changed always
comes up with a near-minimal set of differences.  Usually it is good
enough for practical purposes.  If the <CODE>diff</CODE> output is large, you
might want <CODE>diff</CODE> to use a modified algorithm that sometimes
produces a smaller set of differences.  The <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--minimal'</SAMP> option does this; however, it can also cause
<CODE>diff</CODE> to run more slowly than usual, so it is not the default
behavior.
<P>
When the files you are comparing are large and have small groups of
changes scattered throughout them, you can use the <SAMP>`-H'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--speed-large-files'</SAMP> option to make a different modification to
the algorithm that <CODE>diff</CODE> uses.  If the input files have a constant
small density of changes, this option speeds up the comparisons without
changing the output.  If not, <CODE>diff</CODE> might produce a larger set of
differences; however, the output will still be correct.
<P>
Normally <CODE>diff</CODE> discards the prefix and suffix that is common to
both files before it attempts to find a minimal set of differences.
This makes <CODE>diff</CODE> run faster, but occasionally it may produce
non-minimal output.  The <SAMP>`--horizon-lines=<VAR>lines</VAR>'</SAMP> option
prevents <CODE>diff</CODE> from discarding the last <VAR>lines</VAR> lines of the
prefix and the first <VAR>lines</VAR> lines of the suffix.  This gives
<CODE>diff</CODE> further opportunities to find a minimal output.
