<P>
If you find our Developer's Kit distribution useful, please feel free to
give or sell copies of the software and documentation to anyone you
like.
<P>
In this release, we've assembled the most current editions of these
software development tools, tested them, made sure they work well
together, and made them easy to install. The installation tape comes
with binaries already compiled for your system, and we've made them easy
to reconfigure and recompile from source.
<P>
These tools are free software; they are part of the GNU project,
produced by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  "GNU" is
the name of the FSF's evolving operating system (in speech, the
`G' is sounded).  Cygnus Support collaborates with the FSF in
developing these tools. (For more information on the relationship
between Cygnus Support and the FSF, please see
section <A HREF="intro_8.html#SEC8">Cygnus Support and the FSF</A>.)
<P>
Cygnus Support exists to help our clients exploit their freedom in
using, adapting, or enhancing this software.  Cygnus products are
<DFN>free software</DFN>, protected by the GNU General Public License
(<DFN>GPL</DFN>).  The GPL gives you the freedom to copy or adapt
any program it licenses--but every person getting a copy also gets with
it the freedom to modify that copy (which means that they must have
access to the source code), and the freedom to distribute further
copies.  Traditional software companies use copyrights to limit your
freedoms; the GPL is designed to preserve your freedoms.
<P>
Fundamentally, the General Public License is a license which grants you
these freedoms, and only imposes restrictions to ensure that no one can
take these freedoms away from anyone else.
<P>
For full details, see the <STRONG>LICENSE</STRONG> section in this manual set,
or the file <TT>`COPYING'</TT> in the top level of the source code
distribution.
