<P>
For large systems, it is often desirable to put sources in a separate
directory from the binaries.  The <DFN>directory search</DFN> features of
<CODE>make</CODE> facilitate this by searching several directories
automatically to find a dependency.  When you redistribute the files
among directories, you do not need to change the individual rules,
just the search paths.
