<H2><A NAME="SEC99" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC99">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</A></H2>
<P>
<DFN>Suffix rules</DFN> are the old-fashioned way of defining implicit rules for
<CODE>make</CODE>.  Suffix rules are obsolete because pattern rules are more
general and clearer.  They are supported in GNU <CODE>make</CODE> for
compatibility with old makefiles.  They come in two kinds:
<DFN>double-suffix</DFN> and <DFN>single-suffix</DFN>.<P>
A double-suffix rule is defined by a pair of suffixes: the target suffix
and the source suffix.  It matches any file whose name ends with the
target suffix.  The corresponding implicit dependency is made by
replacing the target suffix with the source suffix in the file name.  A
two-suffix rule whose target and source suffixes are <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> is equivalent to the pattern rule <SAMP>`%.o : %.c'</SAMP>.
<P>
A single-suffix rule is defined by a single suffix, which is the source
suffix.  It matches any file name, and the corresponding implicit
dependency name is made by appending the source suffix.  A single-suffix
rule whose source suffix is <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> is equivalent to the pattern rule
<SAMP>`% : %.c'</SAMP>.
<P>
Suffix rule definitions are recognized by comparing each rule's target
against a defined list of known suffixes.  When <CODE>make</CODE> sees a rule
whose target is a known suffix, this rule is considered a single-suffix
rule.  When <CODE>make</CODE> sees a rule whose target is two known suffixes
concatenated, this rule is taken as a double-suffix rule.
<P>
For example, <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> are both on the default list of
known suffixes.  Therefore, if you define a rule whose target is
<SAMP>`.c.o'</SAMP>, <CODE>make</CODE> takes it to be a double-suffix rule with source
suffix <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> and target suffix <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP>.  Here is the old-fashioned
way to define the rule for compiling a C source file:<P>
<PRE>
.c.o:
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $&#60;
</PRE>
<P>
Suffix rules cannot have any dependencies of their own.  If they have any,
they are treated as normal files with funny names, not as suffix rules.
Thus, the rule:
<P>
<PRE>
.c.o: foo.h
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $&#60;
</PRE>
<P>
tells how to make the file <TT>`.c.o'</TT> from the dependency file
<TT>`foo.h'</TT>, and is not at all like the pattern rule:
<P>
<PRE>
%.o: %.c foo.h
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $&#60;
</PRE>
<P>
which tells how to make <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> files from <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> files, and makes all
<SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> files using this pattern rule also depend on <TT>`foo.h'</TT>.
<P>
Suffix rules with no commands are also meaningless.  They do not remove
previous rules as do pattern rules with no commands (see section <A HREF="make_98.html#SEC97">Canceling Implicit Rules</A>).  They simply enter the suffix or pair of suffixes concatenated as
a target in the data base.<A NAME="IDX821"></A>
<P>
The known suffixes are simply the names of the dependencies of the special
target <CODE>.SUFFIXES</CODE>.  You can add your own suffixes by writing a rule
for <CODE>.SUFFIXES</CODE> that adds more dependencies, as in:
<P>
<PRE>
.SUFFIXES: .hack .win
</PRE>
<P>
which adds <SAMP>`.hack'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`.win'</SAMP> to the end of the list of suffixes.
<P>
If you wish to eliminate the default known suffixes instead of just adding
to them, write a rule for <CODE>.SUFFIXES</CODE> with no dependencies.  By
special dispensation, this eliminates all existing dependencies of
<CODE>.SUFFIXES</CODE>.  You can then write another rule to add the suffixes you
want.  For example,
<P>
<PRE>
.SUFFIXES:            # Delete the default suffixes
.SUFFIXES: .c .o .h   # Define our suffix list
</PRE>
<P>
The <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--no-builtin-rules'</SAMP> flag causes the default
list of suffixes to be empty.
<A NAME="IDX822"></A>
<P>
The variable <CODE>SUFFIXES</CODE> is defined to the default list of suffixes
before <CODE>make</CODE> reads any makefiles.  You can change the list of suffixes
with a rule for the special target <CODE>.SUFFIXES</CODE>, but that does not alter
this variable.
