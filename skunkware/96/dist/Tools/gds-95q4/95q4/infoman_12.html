<P>
A <DFN>mode line</DFN> is a line of inverse video which appears at the bottom
of an info window.  It describes the contents of the window just above
it; this information includes the name of the file and node appearing in
that window, the number of screen lines it takes to display the node,
and the percentage of text that is above the top of the window.  It can
also tell you if the indirect tags table for this info file needs to be
updated, and whether or not the info file was compressed when stored on
disk.
<P>
Here is a sample mode line for a window containing an uncompressed file
named <TT>`dir'</TT>, showing the node <SAMP>`Top'</SAMP>.
<P>
<PRE>
-----Info: (dir)Top, 40 lines --Top-------------------------
            ^^   ^   ^^^        ^^
          (file)Node #lines    where
</PRE>
<P>
When a node comes from a file which is compressed on disk, this is
indicated in the mode line with two small <SAMP>`z'</SAMP>'s.  In addition, if
the info file containing the node has been split into subfiles, the name
of the subfile containing the node appears in the modeline as well:
<P>
<PRE>
--zz-Info: (emacs)Top, 291 lines --Top-- Subfile: emacs-1.Z-
</PRE>
<P>
When Info makes a node internally, such that there is no corresponding
info file on disk, the name of the node is surrounded by asterisks
(<SAMP>`*'</SAMP>).  The name itself tells you what the contents of the window
are; the sample mode line below shows an internally constructed node
showing possible completions:

-----Info: *Completions*, 7 lines --All---------------------
