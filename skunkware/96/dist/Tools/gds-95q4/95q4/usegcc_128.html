<P>
The GNU compiler can produce two kinds of diagnostics: errors and
warnings.  Each kind has a different purpose:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<EM>Errors</EM> report problems that make it impossible to compile your
program.  GNU CC reports errors with the source file name and line
number where the problem is apparent.

<LI>
<EM>Warnings</EM> report other unusual conditions in your code that
<EM>may</EM> indicate a problem, although compilation can (and does)
proceed.  Warning messages also report the source file name and line
number, but include the text <SAMP>`warning:'</SAMP> to distinguish them
from error messages.
</UL>
<P>
Warnings may indicate danger points where you should check to make sure
that your program really does what you intend; or the use of obsolete
features; or the use of nonstandard features of GNU C or C++.  Many
warnings are issued only if you ask for them, with one of the <SAMP>`-W'</SAMP>
options (for instance, <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP> requests a variety of useful
warnings).
<P>
GNU CC always tries to compile your program if possible; it never
gratuitously rejects a program whose meaning is clear merely because
(for instance) it fails to conform to a standard.  In some cases,
however, the C and C++ standards specify that certain extensions are
forbidden, and a diagnostic <EM>must</EM> be issued by a conforming
compiler.  The <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> option tells GNU CC to issue warnings in
such cases; <SAMP>`-pedantic-errors'</SAMP> says to make them errors instead.
This does not mean that <EM>all</EM> non-ANSI constructs get warnings
or errors.
<P>
See section <A HREF="usegcc_12.html#SEC15">Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</A>, for
more detail on these and related command-line options.
