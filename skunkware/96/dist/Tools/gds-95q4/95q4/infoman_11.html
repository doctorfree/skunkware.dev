<P>
A <DFN>window</DFN> is a place to show the text of a node.  Windows have a
view area where the text of the node is displayed, and an associated
<DFN>mode line</DFN>, which briefly describes the node being viewed.
<P>
GNU Info supports multiple windows appearing in a single screen; each
window is separated from the next by its modeline.  At any time, there
is only one <DFN>active</DFN> window, that is, the window in which the cursor
appears.  There are commands available for creating windows, changing
the size of windows, selecting which window is active, and for deleting
windows.
