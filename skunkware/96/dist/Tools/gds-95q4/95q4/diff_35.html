<P>
The RCS output format is designed specifically for use by the Revision
Control System, which is a set of free programs used for organizing
different versions and systems of files.  Use the <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--rcs'</SAMP> option to select this output format.  It is like the
forward <CODE>ed</CODE> format (see section <A HREF="diff_34.html#SEC34">Forward <CODE>ed</CODE> Scripts</A>), but it can represent
arbitrary changes to the contents of a file because it avoids the
forward <CODE>ed</CODE> format's problems with lines consisting of a single
period and with incomplete lines.  Instead of ending text sections with
a line consisting of a single period, each command specifies the number
of lines it affects; a combination of the <SAMP>`a'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`d'</SAMP>
commands are used instead of <SAMP>`c'</SAMP>.  Also, if the second file ends
in a changed incomplete line, then the output also ends in an
incomplete line.

Here is the output of <SAMP>`diff -n lao tzu'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="diff_11.html#SEC11">Two Sample Input Files</A>, for the complete contents of the two files):

They both may be called deep and profound.
Deeper and more profound,
The door of all subtleties!
