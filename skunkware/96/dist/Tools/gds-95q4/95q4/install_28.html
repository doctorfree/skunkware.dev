<P>
We do not recommend using the cross-development kit with less than four
(4) megabytes of RAM.
<P>
We provide a MS-DOS extender with the cross-development kit for
MS-DOS which swaps programs to disk when MS-DOS runs out of
memory.  To avoid excessive swapping you must have at least 2
megabytes of RAM to run G++ on a PC with MS-DOS.
<P>
If you've got more than 2 megabytes, the extra memory can be used as a
disk cache to significantly improve performance.
