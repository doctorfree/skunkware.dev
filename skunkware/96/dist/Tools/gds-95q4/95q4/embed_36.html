<P>
GDB needs to know these things to talk to your MIPS:
<P>
<OL>

<LI>
what serial device connects your host to your MIPS board (the first
serial device available on your host is the default).

<LI>
what speed to use over the serial device.
</OL>
<P>
<CODE>mips-idt-ecoff-gdb</CODE> uses the MIPS remote serial protocol to
connect your development host machine to the target board.  On the
target board itself, the IDT program <CODE>IDT/sim</CODE> implements the
same protocol.  (<CODE>IDT/sim</CODE> runs automatically whenever the board is
powered up.)
<P>
Use these GDB commands to specify the connection to your target board:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>target mips <VAR>port</VAR></CODE>
<DD>To run a program on the board, start up GDB with the name of your
program as the argument.  To connect to the board, use the command
<SAMP>`target mips <VAR>port</VAR>'</SAMP>, where <VAR>port</VAR> is the name of the
serial port connected to the board.  If the program has not already been
downloaded to the board, you may use the <CODE>load</CODE> command to download
it.  You can then use all the usual GDB commands.

For example, this sequence connects to the target board through a serial
port, and loads and runs a program called <VAR>prog</VAR> through the
debugger:

<PRE>
host$ mips-idt-ecoff-gdb <VAR>prog</VAR>
GDB is free software and ...
(gdb) target mips /dev/ttyb
...
(gdb) load
...
(gdb) run
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>target mips <VAR>hostname</VAR>:<VAR>portnumber</VAR></CODE>
<DD>You can specify a TCP/IP connection instead of a serial port, using the syntax
<CODE><VAR>hostname</VAR>:<VAR>portnumber</VAR></CODE> (assuming your IDT board is
connected so that this makes sense; for instance, to a serial line
managed by a terminal concentrator).
</DL>
<P>
GDB also supports these special commands for IDT/MIPS
targets:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>set mipsfpu off</CODE>
<DD>If your target board does not support the MIPS floating point
coprocessor, you should use the command <SAMP>`set mipsfpu off'</SAMP> (you may
wish to put this in your <TT>`.gdbinit'</TT> file).  This tells GDB
how to find the return value of functions which return floating point
values.  It also allows GDB to avoid saving the floating point
registers when calling functions on the board.

If you neglect to do this, calls into your program, such as 
<SAMP>`print strlen("abc")'</SAMP>, will fail.

<DT><CODE>set remotedebug <VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD>You can see some debugging information about communications with the board
by setting the <CODE>remotedebug</CODE> variable.  If you set it to 1 using
<SAMP>`set remotedebug 1'</SAMP> every packet will be displayed.  If you set it
to 2 every character will be displayed.  You can check the current value
at any time with the command <SAMP>`show remotedebug'</SAMP>.
