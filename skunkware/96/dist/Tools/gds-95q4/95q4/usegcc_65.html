Compound expressions, conditional expressions and casts are allowed as
lvalues provided their operands are lvalues.  This means that you can take
their addresses or store values into them.
<P>
Standard C++ allows compound expressions and conditional expressions as
lvalues, and permits casts to reference type, so use of this extension
is deprecated for C++ code.
<P>
For example, a compound expression can be assigned, provided the last
expression in the sequence is an lvalue.  These two expressions are
equivalent:
<P>
<PRE>
(a, b) += 5
a, (b += 5)
</PRE>
<P>
Similarly, the address of the compound expression can be taken.  These two
expressions are equivalent:
<P>
<PRE>
&#38;(a, b)
a, &#38;b
</PRE>
<P>
A conditional expression is a valid lvalue if its type is not void and the
true and false branches are both valid lvalues.  For example, these two
expressions are equivalent:
<P>
<PRE>
(a ? b : c) = 5
(a ? b = 5 : (c = 5))
</PRE>
<P>
A cast is a valid lvalue if its operand is an lvalue.  A simple
assignment whose left-hand side is a cast works by converting the
right-hand side first to the specified type, then to the type of the
inner left-hand side expression.  After this is stored, the value is
converted back to the specified type to become the value of the
assignment.  Thus, if <CODE>a</CODE> has type <CODE>char *</CODE>, the following two
expressions are equivalent:
<P>
<PRE>
(int)a = 5
(int)(a = (char *)(int)5)
</PRE>
<P>
An assignment-with-arithmetic operation such as <SAMP>`+='</SAMP> applied to a cast
performs the arithmetic using the type resulting from the cast, and then
continues as in the previous case.  Therefore, these two expressions are
equivalent:
<P>
<PRE>
(int)a += 5
(int)(a = (char *)(int) ((int)a + 5))
</PRE>
<P>
You cannot take the address of an lvalue cast, because the use of its
address would not work out coherently.  Suppose that <CODE>&#38;(int)f</CODE> were
permitted, where <CODE>f</CODE> has type <CODE>float</CODE>.  Then the following
statement would try to store an integer bit-pattern where a floating
point number belongs:
<P>
<PRE>
*&#38;(int)f = 1;
</PRE>
<P>
This is quite different from what <CODE>(int)f = 1</CODE> would do--that
would convert 1 to floating point and store it.  Rather than cause this
inconsistency, we think it is better to prohibit use of <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> on a cast.
<P>
If you really do want an <CODE>int *</CODE> pointer with the address of
<CODE>f</CODE>, you can simply write <CODE>(int *)&#38;f</CODE>.
