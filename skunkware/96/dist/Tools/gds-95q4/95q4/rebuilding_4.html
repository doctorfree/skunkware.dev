<P>
Your tape is labeled to indicate the host (and target, if applicable)
for which the binaries in the distribution are configured.  The
specifications used for hosts and targets in the <CODE>configure</CODE> script
are based on a three-part naming scheme, though the scheme is slightly
different between hosts and targets.
