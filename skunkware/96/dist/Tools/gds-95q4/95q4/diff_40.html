#ifndef TWO
The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way;
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
#endif /* not TWO */
The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
#ifndef TWO
The Named is the mother of all things.
#else /* TWO */
The named is the mother of all things.

#endif /* TWO */

  so we may see their subtlety,
And let there always be being,
  so we may see their outcome.

But after they are produced,
  they have different names.
#ifdef TWO

The door of all subtleties!
#endif /* TWO */
