<P>
When compiling code for certain platforms (currently the Hitachi H8/300
and the Tandem ST-2000), you can instruct <CODE>gcc</CODE> that certain functions are
meant to be called from hardware interrupts.
<P>
To mark a function as callable from interrupt, include the line
<SAMP>`#pragma interrupt'</SAMP> somewhere before the beginning of the
function's definition.  (For maximum readability, you might place it
immediately before the definition of the appropriate function.)
<SAMP>`#pragma interrupt'</SAMP> will affect only the next function defined; if
you want to define more than one function with this property, include
<SAMP>`#pragma interrupt'</SAMP> before each of them.
<P>
When you define a function with <SAMP>`#pragma interrupt'</SAMP>, <CODE>gcc</CODE> alters its
usual calling convention, to provide the right environment when the
function is called from an interrupt.  <EM>Such functions cannot be
called in the usual way from your program</EM>.
<P>
You must use other facilities to actually associate these functions with
particular interrupts; <CODE>gcc</CODE> can only compile them in the appropriate way.
