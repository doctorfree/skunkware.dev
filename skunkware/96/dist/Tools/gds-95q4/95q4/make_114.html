<H2><A NAME="SEC113" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC113">Variables for Specifying Commands</A></H2>
<P>
Makefiles should provide variables for overriding certain commands, options,
and so on.
<P>
In particular, you should run most utility programs via variables.
Thus, if you use Bison, have a variable named <CODE>BISON</CODE> whose default
value is set with <SAMP>`BISON = bison'</SAMP>, and refer to it with
<CODE>\$(BISON)</CODE> whenever you need to use Bison.
<P>
File management utilities such as <CODE>ln</CODE>, <CODE>rm</CODE>, <CODE>mv</CODE>, and
so on, need not be referred to through variables in this way, since users
don't need to replace them with other programs.
<P>
Each program-name variable should come with an options variable that is
used to supply options to the program.  Append <SAMP>`FLAGS'</SAMP> to the
program-name variable name to get the options variable name--for
example, <CODE>BISONFLAGS</CODE>.  (The name <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> is an exception to
this rule, but we keep it because it is standard.)  Use <CODE>CPPFLAGS</CODE>
in any compilation command that runs the preprocessor, and use
<CODE>LDFLAGS</CODE> in any compilation command that does linking as well as
in any direct use of <CODE>ld</CODE>.
<P>
If there are C compiler options that <EM>must</EM> be used for proper
compilation of certain files, do not include them in <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>.
Users expect to be able to specify <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> freely themselves.
Instead, arrange to pass the necessary options to the C compiler
independently of <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>, by writing them explicitly in the
compilation commands or by defining an implicit rule, like this:
<P>
<PRE>
CFLAGS = -g
ALL_CFLAGS = -I. $(CFLAGS)
.c.o:
        $(CC) -c $(CPPFLAGS) $(ALL_CFLAGS) $&#60;
</PRE>
<P>
Do include the <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> option in <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>, because that is not
<EM>required</EM> for proper compilation.  You can consider it a default
that is only recommended.  If the package is set up so that it is
compiled with GCC by default, then you might as well include <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>
in the default value of <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> as well.
<P>
Put <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> last in the compilation command, after other variables
containing compiler options, so the user can use <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> to
override the others.
<P>
Every Makefile should define the variable <CODE>INSTALL</CODE>, which is the
basic command for installing a file into the system.
<P>
Every Makefile should also define the variables <CODE>INSTALL_PROGRAM</CODE>
and <CODE>INSTALL_DATA</CODE>.  (The default for each of these should be
<CODE>\$(INSTALL)</CODE>.)  Then it should use those variables as the commands
for actual installation, for executables and nonexecutables
respectively.  Use these variables as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
$(INSTALL_PROGRAM) foo $(bindir)/foo
$(INSTALL_DATA) libfoo.a $(libdir)/libfoo.a
</PRE>
<P>
Always use a file name, not a directory name, as the second argument of
the installation commands.  Use a separate command for each file to be
installed.
<P>
