<H2><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="usegcc_toc.html#TOC18">Options Controlling the Preprocessor</A></H2>
<P>
These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.
<P>
If you use the <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
Some of these options make sense only together with <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> because
they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
compilation.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-include <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Process <VAR>file</VAR> as input before processing the regular input file.
In effect, the contents of <VAR>file</VAR> are compiled first.  Any <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`-U'</SAMP> options on the command line are always processed before
<SAMP>`-include <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>, regardless of the order in which they are
written.  All the <SAMP>`-include'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-imacros'</SAMP> options are
processed in the order in which they are written.

<DT><CODE>-imacros <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Process <VAR>file</VAR> as input, discarding the resulting output, before
processing the regular input file.  Because the output generated from
<VAR>file</VAR> is discarded, the only effect of <SAMP>`-imacros <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>
is to make the macros defined in <VAR>file</VAR> available for use in the
main input.

Any <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-U'</SAMP> options on the command line are always
processed before <SAMP>`-imacros <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>, regardless of the order in
which they are written.  All the <SAMP>`-include'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-imacros'</SAMP>
options are processed in the order in which they are written.

<A NAME="IDX84"></A>
<DT><CODE>-idirafter <VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Add the directory <VAR>dir</VAR> to the second include path.  The directories
on the second include path are searched when a header file is not found
in any of the directories in the main include path (the one that
<SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> adds to).

<DT><CODE>-iprefix <VAR>prefix</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Specify <VAR>prefix</VAR> as the prefix for subsequent <SAMP>`-iwithprefix'</SAMP>
options.

<DT><CODE>-iwithprefix <VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Add a directory to the second include path.  The directory's name is
made by concatenating <VAR>prefix</VAR> and <VAR>dir</VAR>, where <VAR>prefix</VAR> was
specified previously with <SAMP>`-iprefix'</SAMP>.  If you have not specified a
prefix yet, the directory containing the installed passes of the
compiler is used as the default.

<DT><CODE>-iwithprefixbefore <VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Add a directory to the main include path.  The directory's name is made
by concatenating <VAR>prefix</VAR> and <VAR>dir</VAR>, as in the case of
<SAMP>`-iwithprefix'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>-isystem <VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Add a directory to the beginning of the second include path, marking it
as a system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment as
is applied to the standard system directories.

<DT><CODE>-nostdinc</CODE>
<DD>Do not search the standard system directories for header files.  Only
the directories you have specified with <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> options (and the
current directory, if appropriate) are searched.  See section <A HREF="usegcc_18.html#SEC21">Options for Directory Search</A>, for information on <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP>.

By using both <SAMP>`-nostdinc'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP>, you can limit the include-file
search path to only those directories you specify explicitly.

<DT><CODE>-undef</CODE>
<DD>Do not predefine any nonstandard macros.  (Including architecture flags).

<DT><CODE>-E</CODE>
<DD>Run only the C preprocessor.  Preprocess all the C source files
specified and output the results to standard output or to the
specified output file.

<DT><CODE>-C</CODE>
<DD>Tell the preprocessor not to discard comments.  Used with the
<SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> option.

<DT><CODE>-P</CODE>
<DD>Tell the preprocessor not to generate <SAMP>`#line'</SAMP> directives.
Used with the <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> option.

<A NAME="IDX86"></A>
<A NAME="IDX85"></A>
<DT><CODE>-M</CODE>
<DD>Tell the preprocessor to output a rule suitable for <CODE>make</CODE>
describing the dependencies of each object file.  For each source file,
the preprocessor outputs one <CODE>make</CODE>-rule whose target is the object
file name for that source file and whose dependencies are all the
<CODE>#include</CODE> header files it uses.  This rule may be a single line or
may be continued with <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>-newline if it is long.  The list of rules
is printed on standard output instead of the preprocessed C program.

<SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> implies <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP>.

Another way to specify output of a <CODE>make</CODE> rule is by setting
the environment variable <CODE>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</CODE> (see section <A HREF="usegcc_41.html#SEC44">Environment Variables Affecting GNU CC</A>).

<DT><CODE>-MM</CODE>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> but the output mentions only the user header files
included with <SAMP>`#include "<VAR>file</VAR>"'</SAMP>.  System header files
included with <SAMP>`#include &#60;<VAR>file</VAR>&#62;'</SAMP> are omitted.

<DT><CODE>-MD</CODE>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> but the dependency information is written to a file made by
replacing ".c" with ".d" at the end of the input file names.
This is in addition to compiling the file as specified---<SAMP>`-MD'</SAMP> does
not inhibit ordinary compilation the way <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> does.

In Mach, you can use the utility <CODE>md</CODE> to merge multiple dependency
files into a single dependency file suitable for using with the <SAMP>`make'</SAMP>
command.

<DT><CODE>-MMD</CODE>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`-MD'</SAMP> except mention only user header files, not system
header files.

<DT><CODE>-MG</CODE>
<DD>Treat missing header files as generated files and assume they live in the
same directory as the source file.  If you specify <SAMP>`-MG'</SAMP>, you
must also specify either <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-MM'</SAMP>.  <SAMP>`-MG'</SAMP> is not
supported with <SAMP>`-MD'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-MMD'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>-H</CODE>
<DD>Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other normal
activities.

<DT><CODE>-A<VAR>question</VAR>(<VAR>answer</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Assert the answer <VAR>answer</VAR> for <VAR>question</VAR>, in case it is tested
with a preprocessing conditional such as <SAMP>`#if
#<VAR>question</VAR>(<VAR>answer</VAR>)'</SAMP>.  <SAMP>`-A-'</SAMP> disables the standard
assertions that normally describe the target machine.

<DT><CODE>-D<VAR>macro</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Define macro <VAR>macro</VAR> with the string <SAMP>`1'</SAMP> as its definition.

<DT><CODE>-D<VAR>macro</VAR>=<VAR>defn</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Define macro <VAR>macro</VAR> as <VAR>defn</VAR>.  All instances of <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> on
the command line are processed before any <SAMP>`-U'</SAMP> options.

<DT><CODE>-U<VAR>macro</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Undefine macro <VAR>macro</VAR>.  <SAMP>`-U'</SAMP> options are evaluated after all
<SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> options, but before any <SAMP>`-include'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-imacros'</SAMP>
options.

<DT><CODE>-dM</CODE>
<DD>Tell the preprocessor to output only a list of the macro definitions
that are in effect at the end of preprocessing.  Used with the <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP>
option.

<DT><CODE>-dD</CODE>
<DD>Tell the preprocessing to pass all macro definitions into the output, in
their proper sequence in the rest of the output.

<DT><CODE>-dN</CODE>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`-dD'</SAMP> except that the macro arguments and contents are omitted.
Only <SAMP>`#define <VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP> is included in the output.

<DT><CODE>-trigraphs</CODE>
<DD>Support ANSI C trigraphs.  The <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> option also has this effect.

<DT><CODE>-Wp,<VAR>option</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Pass <VAR>option</VAR> as an option to the preprocessor.  If <VAR>option</VAR>
contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.
