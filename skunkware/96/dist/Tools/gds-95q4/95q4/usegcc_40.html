<H2><A NAME="SEC43" HREF="usegcc_toc.html#TOC43">Options for Code Generation Conventions</A></H2>
<P>
These machine-independent options control the interface conventions
used in code generation.
<P>
Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
of <SAMP>`-ffoo'</SAMP> would be <SAMP>`-fno-foo'</SAMP>.  In the table below, only
one of the forms is listed--the one which is not the default.  You
can figure out the other form by either removing <SAMP>`no-'</SAMP> or adding
it.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-fpcc-struct-return</CODE>
<DD>Return "short" <CODE>struct</CODE> and <CODE>union</CODE> values in memory like
longer ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less
efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability between
GNU CC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers.

The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends
on the target configuration macros.

Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment match
that of some integer type.

<DT><CODE>-freg-struct-return</CODE>
<DD>Use the convention that <CODE>struct</CODE> and <CODE>union</CODE> values are
returned in registers when possible.  This is more efficient for small
structures than <SAMP>`-fpcc-struct-return'</SAMP>.

If you specify neither <SAMP>`-fpcc-struct-return'</SAMP> nor its contrary
<SAMP>`-freg-struct-return'</SAMP>, GNU CC defaults to whichever convention is
standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, GNU CC
defaults to <SAMP>`-fpcc-struct-return'</SAMP>, except on targets where GNU CC
is the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the standard,
and we chose the more efficient register return alternative.

<DT><CODE>-fshort-enums</CODE>
<DD>Allocate to an <CODE>enum</CODE> type only as many bytes as it needs for the
declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the <CODE>enum</CODE> type
will be equivalent to the smallest integer type which has enough room.

<DT><CODE>-fshort-double</CODE>
<DD>Use the same size for <CODE>double</CODE> as for <CODE>float</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-fshared-data</CODE>
<DD>Requests that the data and non-<CODE>const</CODE> variables of this
compilation be shared data rather than private data.  The distinction
makes sense only on certain operating systems, where shared data is
shared between processes running the same program, while private data
exists in one copy per process.

<DT><CODE>-fno-common</CODE>
<DD>Allocate even uninitialized global variables in the bss section of the
object file, rather than generating them as common blocks.  This has the
effect that if the same variable is declared (without <CODE>extern</CODE>) in
two different compilations, you will get an error when you link them.
The only reason this might be useful is if you wish to verify that the
program will work on other systems which always work this way.

<DT><CODE>-fno-ident</CODE>
<DD>Ignore the <SAMP>`#ident'</SAMP> directive.

<DT><CODE>-fno-gnu-linker</CODE>
<DD>Do not output global initializations (such as C++ constructors and
destructors) in the form used by the GNU linker (on systems where the GNU
linker is the standard method of handling them).  Use this option when
you want to use a non-GNU linker, which also requires using the
<CODE>collect2</CODE> program to make sure the system linker includes
constructors and destructors.  (<CODE>collect2</CODE> is included in the GNU CC
distribution.)  For systems which <EM>must</EM> use <CODE>collect2</CODE>, the
compiler driver <CODE>gcc</CODE> is configured to do this automatically.

<DT><CODE>-finhibit-size-directive</CODE>
<DD>Don't output a <CODE>.size</CODE> assembler directive, or anything else that
would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the 
two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This option is
used when compiling <TT>`crtstuff.c'</TT>; you should not need to use it
for anything else.

<DT><CODE>-fverbose-asm</CODE>
<DD>Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while
debugging the compiler itself).

<DT><CODE>-fvolatile</CODE>
<DD>Consider all memory references through pointers to be volatile.

<DT><CODE>-fvolatile-global</CODE>
<DD>Consider all memory references to extern and global data items to
be volatile.

<A NAME="IDX211"></A>
<A NAME="IDX210"></A>
<DT><CODE>-fpic</CODE>
<DD>Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in a shared
library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code accesses all
constant addresses through a global offset table (GOT).  If the GOT size
for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific maximum size, you
get an error message from the linker indicating that <SAMP>`-fpic'</SAMP> does
not work; in that case, recompile with <SAMP>`-fPIC'</SAMP> instead.  (These
maximums are 16k on the m88k, 8k on the Sparc, and 32k on the m68k and
RS/6000.  The 386 has no such limit.)

Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the 386, GNU CC supports PIC for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the IBM RS/6000 is always
position-independent.

The GNU assembler does not fully support PIC.  Currently, you must use
some other assembler in order for PIC to work.  We would welcome
volunteers to upgrade GAS to handle this; the first part of the job is
to figure out what the assembler must do differently.

<DT><CODE>-fPIC</CODE>
<DD>If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code,
suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the size of the
global offset table.  This option makes a difference on the m68k, m88k
and the Sparc.

Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.

<DT><CODE>-ffixed-<VAR>reg</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Treat the register named <VAR>reg</VAR> as a fixed register; generated code
should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame
pointer or in some other fixed role).

<VAR>reg</VAR> must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
are machine-specific and are defined in the <CODE>REGISTER_NAMES</CODE>
macro in the machine description macro file.

This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.

<DT><CODE>-fcall-used-<VAR>reg</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Treat the register named <VAR>reg</VAR> as an allocatable register that is
clobbered by function calls.  It may be allocated for temporaries or
variables that do not live across a call.  Functions compiled this way
will not save and restore the register <VAR>reg</VAR>.

Use of this flag for a register that has a fixed pervasive role in the
machine's execution model, such as the stack pointer or frame pointer,
will produce disastrous results.

This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.

<DT><CODE>-fcall-saved-<VAR>reg</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Treat the register named <VAR>reg</VAR> as an allocatable register saved by
functions.  It may be allocated even for temporaries or variables that
live across a call.  Functions compiled this way will save and restore
the register <VAR>reg</VAR> if they use it.

Use of this flag for a register that has a fixed pervasive role in the
machine's execution model, such as the stack pointer or frame pointer,
will produce disastrous results.

A different sort of disaster will result from the use of this flag for
a register in which function values may be returned.

This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.

<DT><CODE>-fpack-struct</CODE>
<DD>Pack all structure members together without holes.  Usually you would
not want to use this option, since it makes the code suboptimal, and
the offsets of structure members won't agree with system libraries.

<DT><CODE>+e0</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>+e1</CODE>
<DD>Control whether virtual function definitions in classes are used to
generate code, or only to define interfaces for their callers.  (C++
only).

These options are provided for compatibility with <CODE>cfront</CODE> 1.x
usage; the recommended alternative GNU C++ usage is in flux.  See section <A HREF="usegcc_106.html#SEC109">Declarations and Definitions in One Header</A>.

With <SAMP>`+e0'</SAMP>, virtual function definitions in classes are declared
<CODE>extern</CODE>; the declaration is used only as an interface
specification, not to generate code for the virtual functions (in this
compilation).

With <SAMP>`+e1'</SAMP>, G++ actually generates the code implementing virtual
functions defined in the code, and makes them publicly visible.

<DT><CODE>-funaligned-pointers</CODE>
<DD>Assume that all pointers contain unaligned addresses.  On machines where
unaligned memory accesses trap, this will result in much larger and slower
code for all pointer dereferences, but the code will work even if addresses
are unaligned.

<DT><CODE>-funaligned-struct-hack</CODE>
<DD>Always access structure fields using loads and stores of the declared size.
This option is useful for code that derefences pointers to unaligned
structures, but only accesses fields that are themselves aligned.  Without
this option, <CODE>gcc</CODE> may try to use a memory access larger than the field.
This might give an unaligned access fault on some hardware.

This option makes some invalid code work at the expense of disabling
some optimizations.  It is strongly recommended that this option not be
used.
