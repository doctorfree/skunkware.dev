<P>
Here is the output of <SAMP>`diff -c lao tzu'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="diff_11.html#SEC11">Two Sample Input Files</A>,
for the complete contents of the two files).  Notice that up to three
lines that are not different are shown around each line that is
different; they are the context lines.  Also notice that the first two
hunks have run together, because their contents overlap.

- The name that can be named is not the eternal name.

! The Named is the mother of all things.
  Therefore let there always be non-being,
    so we may see their subtlety,
  And let there always be being,

  The two are the same,
  But after they are produced,
    they have different names.
+ They both may be called deep and profound.
+ Deeper and more profound,
+ The door of all subtleties!
