<H2><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC35">Multiple Targets in a Rule</A></H2>
<P>
A rule with multiple targets is equivalent to writing many rules, each with
one target, and all identical aside from that.  The same commands apply to
all the targets, but their effects may vary because you can substitute the
actual target name into the command using <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP>.  The rule contributes
the same dependencies to all the targets also.
<P>
This is useful in two cases.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
You want just dependencies, no commands.  For example:

<PRE>
kbd.o command.o files.o: command.h
</PRE>

gives an additional dependency to each of the three object files
mentioned.

<LI>
Similar commands work for all the targets.  The commands do not need
to be absolutely identical, since the automatic variable <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP>
can be used to substitute the particular target to be remade into the
commands (see section <A HREF="make_95.html#SEC94">Automatic Variables</A>).  For example:

<PRE>
bigoutput littleoutput : text.g
        generate text.g -$(subst output,,$@) &#62; $@
<A NAME="IDX190"></A>
</PRE>

is equivalent to

<PRE>
bigoutput : text.g
        generate text.g -big &#62; bigoutput
littleoutput : text.g
        generate text.g -little &#62; littleoutput
</PRE>

Here we assume the hypothetical program <CODE>generate</CODE> makes two
types of output, one if given <SAMP>`-big'</SAMP> and one if given
<SAMP>`-little'</SAMP>.
See section <A HREF="make_74.html#SEC73">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</A>,
for an explanation of the <CODE>subst</CODE> function.
</UL>
<P>
Suppose you would like to vary the dependencies according to the target,
much as the variable <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP> allows you to vary the commands.
You cannot do this with multiple targets in an ordinary rule, but you can
do it with a <DFN>static pattern rule</DFN>.
See section <A HREF="make_38.html#SEC37">Static Pattern Rules</A>.
