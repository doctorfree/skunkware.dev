<P>
To substitute a variable's value, write a dollar sign followed by the name
of the variable in parentheses or braces: either <SAMP>`$(foo)'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`${foo}'</SAMP> is a valid reference to the variable <CODE>foo</CODE>.  This
special significance of <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> is why you must write <SAMP>`$$'</SAMP> to have
the effect of a single dollar sign in a file name or command.
<P>
Variable references can be used in any context: targets, dependencies,
commands, most directives, and new variable values.  Here is an
example of a common case, where a variable holds the names of all the
object files in a program:
<P>
<PRE>
objects = program.o foo.o utils.o
program : $(objects)
        cc -o program $(objects)

$(objects) : defs.h
</PRE>
<P>
Variable references work by strict textual substitution.  Thus, the rule
<P>
<PRE>
foo = c
prog.o : prog.$(foo)
        $(foo)$(foo) -$(foo) prog.$(foo)
</PRE>
<P>
could be used to compile a C program <TT>`prog.c'</TT>.  Since spaces before
the variable value are ignored in variable assignments, the value of
<CODE>foo</CODE> is precisely <SAMP>`c'</SAMP>.  (Don't actually write your makefiles
this way!)
<P>
A dollar sign followed by a character other than a dollar sign,
open-parenthesis or open-brace treats that single character as the
variable name.  Thus, you could reference the variable <CODE>x</CODE> with
<SAMP>`$x'</SAMP>.  However, this practice is strongly discouraged, except in
the case of the automatic variables (see section <A HREF="make_95.html#SEC94">Automatic Variables</A>).
