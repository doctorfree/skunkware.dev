<P>
Every Makefile should contain this line:
<P>
<PRE>
SHELL = /bin/sh
</PRE>
<P>
to avoid trouble on systems where the <CODE>SHELL</CODE> variable might be
inherited from the environment.  (This is never a problem with GNU
<CODE>make</CODE>.)
<P>
Different <CODE>make</CODE> programs have incompatible suffix lists and
implicit rules, and this sometimes creates confusion or misbehavior.  So
it is a good idea to set the suffix list explicitly using only the
suffixes you need in the particular Makefile, like this:
<P>
<PRE>
.SUFFIXES:
.SUFFIXES: .c .o
</PRE>
<P>
The first line clears out the suffix list, the second introduces all
suffixes which may be subject to implicit rules in this Makefile.
<P>
Don't assume that <TT>`.'</TT> is in the path for command execution.  When
you need to run programs that are a part of your package during the
make, please make sure that it uses <TT>`./'</TT> if the program is built as
part of the make or <TT>`$(srcdir)/'</TT> if the file is an unchanging part
of the source code.  Without one of these prefixes, the current search
path is used.  
<P>
The distinction between <TT>`./'</TT> and <TT>`$(srcdir)/'</TT> is important
when using the <SAMP>`--srcdir'</SAMP> option to <TT>`configure'</TT>.  A rule of
the form:
<P>
<PRE>
foo.1 : foo.man sedscript
        sed -e sedscript foo.man &#62; foo.1
</PRE>
<P>
will fail when the current directory is not the source directory,
because <TT>`foo.man'</TT> and <TT>`sedscript'</TT> are not in the current
directory.
<P>
When using GNU <CODE>make</CODE>, relying on <SAMP>`VPATH'</SAMP> to find the source
file will work in the case where there is a single dependency file,
since the <TT>`make'</TT> automatic variable <SAMP>`$&#60;'</SAMP> will represent the
source file wherever it is.  (Many versions of <CODE>make</CODE> set <SAMP>`$&#60;'</SAMP>
only in implicit rules.)  A makefile target like
<P>
<PRE>
foo.o : bar.c
        $(CC) -I. -I$(srcdir) $(CFLAGS) -c bar.c -o foo.o
</PRE>
<P>
should instead be written as
<P>
<PRE>
foo.o : bar.c
        $(CC) -I. -I$(srcdir) $(CFLAGS) -c $&#60; -o $@
</PRE>
<P>
in order to allow <SAMP>`VPATH'</SAMP> to work correctly.  When the target has
multiple dependencies, using an explicit <SAMP>`\$(srcdir)'</SAMP> is the easiest
way to make the rule work well.  For example, the target above for
<TT>`foo.1'</TT> is best written as:
<P>
<PRE>
foo.1 : foo.man sedscript
        sed -e $(srcdir)/sedscript $(srcdir)/foo.man &#62; $@
</PRE>
