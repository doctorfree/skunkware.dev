<DT><CODE>bin</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>source</CODE>
<DD>By default, <CODE>Install</CODE> extracts both source and binaries.  Instead
of relying on the default, you can use these options to specify exactly
what you want.  You need to do this if you want <EM>only</EM> binaries or
<EM>only</EM> source.

<CODE>Install</CODE> is designed to share files, wherever possible, between
installations for different hosts (of the same release).  If you get
Cygnus release tapes configured for different hosts, there is no need to
do a binary-only install of some of the tapes to save space on a shared
file system; <CODE>Install</CODE> arranges the files so that all hosts 
share the same source files.  Documentation files are shared as well.
Note that it is faster to extract the source code only once if you are
installing the Developer's Kit distribution for more than one host.

See section <A HREF="install_11.html#SEC11">Links for easy access and updating</A>, for a discussion of
how to manage the directory structure used for this purpose.

<DT><CODE>extract</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>fixincludes</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>test</CODE>
<DD>
In a cross-development configuration, only the <SAMP>`extract'</SAMP> step
is used.

In a native configuration--meant for developing software on the same
host where the Developer's Kit runs--a full installation includes up to
three things: (1) extracting software from the tape; (2) creating
ANSI-C conforming copies of your system's standard header files;
and (3) testing the installation.  You can execute these steps
separately by specifying <SAMP>`extract'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`fixincludes'</SAMP>, or
<SAMP>`test'</SAMP> on the <CODE>Install</CODE> command line.

In the native configuration, after you run <SAMP>`extract'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`fixincludes'</SAMP> is essential to the compiler.  <SAMP>`fixincludes'</SAMP>
<EM>does not change your system's original header files;</EM>
<CODE>Install</CODE> writes the converted copies in a separate,
<CODE>gcc</CODE>-specific directory.  See section <A HREF="install_10.html#SEC10">Why convert system header files?</A>, for more discussion of the <SAMP>`fixincludes'</SAMP>
step.  <CODE>Install</CODE> only attempts these last two steps if you run
it on the host for which the binaries were compiled.

When you run <SAMP>`extract'</SAMP>, <CODE>Install</CODE> creates a log file in
<TT>`/usr/cygnus/progressive-95q4/extraction.log'</TT>.
When you run <SAMP>`fixincludes'</SAMP>, <CODE>Install</CODE> creates a log file
in <TT>`/usr/cygnus/progressive-95q4/fixincludes.log'</TT>.

<SAMP>`test'</SAMP> (used only for the native configuration) is a
confidence-building step, and doesn't actually change the state of the
installed software.  The <SAMP>`test'</SAMP> step may not make sense, depending
on what other options you've specified--if you install only source,
there's nothing to test.

<DT><CODE>-tape=<VAR>device</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-tape=<VAR>tarfile</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Specify the <EM>non--rewinding</EM> device name for your tape drive as
<VAR>tape</VAR>.

If you extract the installation script and <VAR>tarfile</VAR> on some other
system, and transfer them to your host for installation, use the name of
the <CODE>tar</CODE> file instead of a device name with <SAMP>`-tape'</SAMP>.
See section <A HREF="install_15.html#SEC15">Installing with a remote tape drive</A>, for more discussion.

<DT><CODE>-installdir=<VAR>directory</VAR></CODE>
<DD>If you cannot or do not wish to install into <SAMP>`/usr/cygnus'</SAMP>, use
this option to specify an alternate <VAR>directory</VAR> for placing your
software--but beware: the software is configured to go in
<SAMP>`/usr/cygnus'</SAMP>, and you'll have to override or change that too.
See section <A HREF="install_16.html#SEC16">Running the programs</A>.
</DL>
<P>
If you specify a step that doesn't make sense, <CODE>Install</CODE> notices
the error, and exits (before doing anything at all) with an error
message, so you can try again.
