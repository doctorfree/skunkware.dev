<TITLE>Installation Notes - Invoking Install</TITLE>

Go to the <A HREF="install_1.html">first</A>, <A HREF="install_7.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="install_9.html">next</A>, <A HREF="install_37.html">last</A> section, <A HREF="install_toc.html">table of contents</A>.

<H3><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="install_toc.html#TOC8">Invoking the <CODE>Install</CODE> script</A></H3>
<P>
There are two kinds of command-line arguments to <CODE>Install</CODE>, which
you can use to direct its operation:
<UL>
<LI>
<EM>What form of the programs</EM> to install.  You can choose between
binaries (argument <CODE>bin</CODE>) and source code (<CODE>source</CODE>).  If you
don't specify either of these, <CODE>Install</CODE> assumes you want
<EM>both source and binaries</EM>.

<LI>
<EM>What installation actions</EM> to carry out. A full installation
involves up to
three
steps; <CODE>Install</CODE> has options to let you choose them explicitly.
The steps are

<OL>
<LI>
extracting source from the tape (option <CODE>extract</CODE>)

<LI>
writing copies of your system <SAMP>`include'</SAMP> files, adjusted for portability
(needed for the compilation tools; option <CODE>fixincludes</CODE>)

<LI>
running a simple test of the installed programs
(option <CODE>test</CODE>)
</OL>

The last two of these actions (<CODE>fixincludes</CODE> and <CODE>test</CODE>) are
<EM>not needed for cross-development</EM> configurations.  (A
cross-development configuration runs on a <DFN>host</DFN>, but is meant to
develop code for another platform, the <DFN>target</DFN>.  Cross development
tapes have <SAMP>`target = <VAR>target</VAR>'</SAMP> on the tape label.)

These two actions can only run on your host.  If you read the
tape on another machine, you must specify the <CODE>extract</CODE> option
explicitly, to indicate that you don't expect the 
other two actions
to run (and are aware of the need to run further installation steps on
your host).
</UL>
<P>
<CODE>Install</CODE> also has two command line options: <SAMP>`-tape'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-installdir'</SAMP>.  You can use these to adapt the installation to
your system.
