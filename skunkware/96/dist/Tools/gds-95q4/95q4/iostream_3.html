<P>
Per Bothner wrote most of the <CODE>iostream</CODE> library, but some portions
have their origins elsewhere in the free software community.  Heinz
Seidl wrote the IO manipulators.  The floating-point conversion software
is by David M. Gay of AT&#38;T.  Some code was derived from parts of BSD
4.4, which was written at the University of California, Berkeley.
<P>
The iostream classes are found in the <CODE>libio</CODE> library.  An early
version was originally distributed in <CODE>libg++</CODE>, and they are still
included there as well, for convenience if you need other <CODE>libg++</CODE>
classes.  Doug Lea was the original author of <CODE>libg++</CODE>, and some of
the file-management code still in <CODE>libio</CODE> is his.
<P>
Various people found bugs or offered suggestions.  Hongjiu Lu worked
hard to use the library as the default stdio implementation for Linux,
and has provided much stress-testing of the library.
