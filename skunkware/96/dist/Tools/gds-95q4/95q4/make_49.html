<P>
Recursive use of <CODE>make</CODE> means using <CODE>make</CODE> as a command in a
makefile.  This technique is useful when you want separate makefiles for
various subsystems that compose a larger system.  For example, suppose you
have a subdirectory <TT>`subdir'</TT> which has its own makefile, and you would
like the containing directory's makefile to run <CODE>make</CODE> on the
subdirectory.  You can do it by writing this:
<P>
<PRE>
subsystem:
        cd subdir; $(MAKE)
</PRE>
<P>
or, equivalently, this (see section <A HREF="make_86.html#SEC85">Summary of Options</A>):
<P>
<PRE>
subsystem:
        $(MAKE) -C subdir
<A NAME="IDX297"></A>
<A NAME="IDX298"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
You can write recursive <CODE>make</CODE> commands just by copying this example,
but there are many things to know about how they work and why, and about
how the sub-<CODE>make</CODE> relates to the top-level <CODE>make</CODE>.
