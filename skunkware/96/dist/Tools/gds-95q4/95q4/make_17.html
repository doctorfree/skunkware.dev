<P>
If the environment variable <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> is defined, <CODE>make</CODE>
considers its value as a list of names (separated by whitespace) of
additional makefiles to be read before the others.  This works much like
the <CODE>include</CODE> directive: various directories are searched for those
files (see section <A HREF="make_16.html#SEC15">Including Other Makefiles</A>).  In addition, the
default goal is never taken from one of these makefiles and it is not an
error if the files listed in <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> are not found.<A NAME="IDX89"></A>
<P>
The main use of <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> is in communication between recursive
invocations of <CODE>make</CODE> (see section <A HREF="make_49.html#SEC48">Recursive Use of <CODE>make</CODE></A>).  It usually is not desirable to set the environment
variable before a top-level invocation of <CODE>make</CODE>, because it is
usually better not to mess with a makefile from outside.  However, if
you are running <CODE>make</CODE> without a specific makefile, a makefile in
<CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> can do useful things to help the built-in implicit
rules work better, such as defining search paths (see section <A HREF="make_26.html#SEC25">Searching Directories for Dependencies</A>).
<P>
Some users are tempted to set <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> in the environment
automatically on login, and program makefiles to expect this to be done.
This is a very bad idea, because such makefiles will fail to work if run by
anyone else.  It is much better to write explicit <CODE>include</CODE> directives
in the makefiles.  See section <A HREF="make_16.html#SEC15">Including Other Makefiles</A>.
