<P>
A compound statement enclosed in parentheses may appear as an expression
in GNU C.  This allows you to use loops, switches, and local variables
within an expression.
<P>
Recall that a compound statement is a sequence of statements surrounded
by braces; in this construct, parentheses go around the braces.  For
example:
<P>
<PRE>
({ int y = foo (); int z;
   if (y &#62; 0) z = y;
   else z = - y;
   z; })
</PRE>
<P>
is a valid (though slightly more complex than necessary) expression
for the absolute value of <CODE>foo ()</CODE>.
<P>
The last thing in the compound statement should be an expression
followed by a semicolon; the value of this subexpression serves as the
value of the entire construct.  (If you use some other kind of statement
last within the braces, the construct has type <CODE>void</CODE>, and thus
effectively no value.)
<P>
This feature is especially useful in making macro definitions "safe" (so
that they evaluate each operand exactly once).  For example, the
"maximum" function is commonly defined as a macro in standard C as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>
#define max(a,b) ((a) &#62; (b) ? (a) : (b))
</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX248"></A>
But this definition computes either <VAR>a</VAR> or <VAR>b</VAR> twice, with bad
results if the operand has side effects.  In GNU C, if you know the
type of the operands (here let's assume <CODE>int</CODE>), you can define
the macro safely as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
#define maxint(a,b) \
  ({int _a = (a), _b = (b); _a &#62; _b ? _a : _b; })
</PRE>
<P>
Embedded statements are not allowed in constant expressions, such as
the value of an enumeration constant, the width of a bit field, or
the initial value of a static variable.
<P>
If you don't know the type of the operand, you can still do this, but you
must use <CODE>typeof</CODE> (see section <A HREF="usegcc_64.html#SEC67">Referring to a Type with <CODE>typeof</CODE></A>) or type naming (see section <A HREF="usegcc_63.html#SEC66">Naming an Expression's Type</A>).
