<P>
The <CODE>make</CODE> utility automatically determines which pieces of a large
program need to be recompiled, and issues commands to recompile them.
This manual describes GNU <CODE>make</CODE>, which was implemented by Richard
Stallman and Roland McGrath.  GNU <CODE>make</CODE> conforms to section 6.2 of
<CITE>IEEE Standard 1003.2-1992</CITE> (POSIX.2).

<P>
Our examples show C programs, since they are most common, but you can use
<CODE>make</CODE> with any programming language whose compiler can be run with a
shell command.  Indeed, <CODE>make</CODE> is not limited to programs.  You can
use it to describe any task where some files must be updated automatically
from others whenever the others change.
