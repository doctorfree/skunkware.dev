<P>
Often it is desirable to define a macro that expands into a compound
statement.  Consider, for example, the following macro, that advances a
pointer (the argument <SAMP>`p'</SAMP> says where to find it) across whitespace
characters:
<P>
<PRE>
#define SKIP_SPACES (p, limit)  \
{ register char *lim = (limit); \
  while (p != lim) {            \
    if (*p++ != ' ') {          \
      p--; break; }}}
</PRE>
<P>
Here Backslash-Newline is used to split the macro definition, which must
be a single line, so that it resembles the way such C code would be
laid out if not part of a macro definition.
<P>
A call to this macro might be <SAMP>`SKIP_SPACES (p, lim)'</SAMP>.  Strictly
speaking, the call expands to a compound statement, which is a complete
statement with no need for a semicolon to end it.  But it looks like a
function call.  So it minimizes confusion if you can use it like a function
call, writing a semicolon afterward, as in <SAMP>`SKIP_SPACES (p, lim);'</SAMP>
<P>
But this can cause trouble before <SAMP>`else'</SAMP> statements, because the
semicolon is actually a null statement.  Suppose you write
<P>
<PRE>
if (*p != 0)
  SKIP_SPACES (p, lim);
else ...
</PRE>
<P>
The presence of two statements--the compound statement and a null
statement--in between the <SAMP>`if'</SAMP> condition and the <SAMP>`else'</SAMP>
makes invalid C code.
<P>
The definition of the macro <SAMP>`SKIP_SPACES'</SAMP> can be altered to solve
this problem, using a <SAMP>`do ... while'</SAMP> statement.  Here is how:
<P>
<PRE>
#define SKIP_SPACES (p, limit)     \
do { register char *lim = (limit); \
     while (p != lim) {            \
       if (*p++ != ' ') {          \
         p--; break; }}}           \
while (0)
</PRE>
<P>
Now <SAMP>`SKIP_SPACES (p, lim);'</SAMP> expands into
<P>
<PRE>
do {...} while (0);
</PRE>
<P>
which is one statement.
