<P>
Your bug reports play an essential role in making GNU CC reliable.
<P>
When you encounter a problem, the first thing to do is to see if it is
already known.  See section <A HREF="usegcc_113.html#SEC116">Known Causes of Trouble with GNU CC</A>.  If it isn't known, then you should
report the problem.
<P>
Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem, or
it may not.  (If it does not, look in the service directory; see
section <A HREF="usegcc_134.html#SEC137">How To Get Help with GNU CC</A>.)  In any case, the principal function of a bug report is
to help the entire community by making the next version of GNU CC work
better.  Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of GNU CC.
<P>
Since the maintainers are very overloaded, we cannot respond to every
bug report.  However, if the bug has not been fixed, we are likely to
send you a patch and ask you to tell us whether it works. 
<P>
In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that makes for fixing the bug.
