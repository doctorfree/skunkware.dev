<H2><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="relnotes_toc.html#TOC17">New GCC syntax for function attributes</A></H2>
<P>
To declare that a function does not return, you must now use the
<SAMP>`__attribute__'</SAMP> keyword (with two leading and trailing
underbars) to write something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
void fatal () __attribute__ ((noreturn));
</PRE>
<P>
Unfortunately, this new syntax is not compatible with older versions of
GCC.  Here is an alternative syntax, which works in both the current
version and in some older versions:
<P>
<PRE>
typedef void voidfn ();
...
volatile voidfn fatal;
</PRE>
<P>
ANSI C does not permit the formerly used syntax, <SAMP>`volatile
void fatal ();'</SAMP>, to have this meaning.
<P>
Likewise, to declare that a function has no side effects, so that calls
may be deleted or combined, write something like this (which works only
with the latest GCC):
<P>
<PRE>
int computation () __attribute__ ((const));
</PRE>
<P>
or like this (which works in some older versions):
<P>
<PRE>
typedef int intfn ();
...
extern const intfn computation;
</PRE>
<P>
See section `Declaring Attributes of Functions' in <CITE>Using GNU CC</CITE>, for more discussion of function attributes.
