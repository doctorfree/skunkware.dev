<H2><A NAME="SEC89" HREF="usegcc_toc.html#TOC89">Specifying Attributes of Variables</A></H2>
<P>
The keyword <CODE>__attribute__</CODE> allows you to specify special
attributes of variables or structure fields.  This keyword is followed
by an attribute specification inside double parentheses.  Eight
attributes are currently defined for variables: <CODE>aligned</CODE>,
<CODE>mode</CODE>, <CODE>nocommon</CODE>, <CODE>packed</CODE>, <CODE>section</CODE>,
<CODE>transparent_union</CODE>, <CODE>unused</CODE>, and <CODE>weak</CODE>.  Other
attributes are available for functions (see section <A HREF="usegcc_79.html#SEC82">Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>) and
for types (see section <A HREF="usegcc_87.html#SEC90">Specifying Attributes of Types</A>).
<P>
You may also specify attributes with <SAMP>`__'</SAMP> preceding and following
each keyword.  This allows you to use them in header files without
being concerned about a possible macro of the same name.  For example,
you may use <CODE>__aligned__</CODE> instead of <CODE>aligned</CODE>.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX367"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>aligned (<VAR>alignment</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>This attribute specifies a minimum alignment for the variable or
structure field, measured in bytes.  For example, the declaration:

<PRE>
int x __attribute__ ((aligned (16))) = 0;
</PRE>

causes the compiler to allocate the global variable <CODE>x</CODE> on a
16-byte boundary.  On a 68040, this could be used in conjunction with
an <CODE>asm</CODE> expression to access the <CODE>move16</CODE> instruction which
requires 16-byte aligned operands.

You can also specify the alignment of structure fields.  For example, to
create a double-word aligned <CODE>int</CODE> pair, you could write:

<PRE>
struct foo { int x[2] __attribute__ 
                 ((aligned (8))); };
</PRE>

This is an alternative to creating a union with a <CODE>double</CODE> member
that forces the union to be double-word aligned.

It is not possible to specify the alignment of functions; the alignment
of functions is determined by the machine's requirements and cannot be
changed.  You cannot specify alignment for a typedef name because such a
name is just an alias, not a distinct type.

As in the preceding examples, you can explicitly specify the alignment
(in bytes) that you wish the compiler to use for a given variable or
structure field.  Alternatively, you can leave out the alignment factor
and just ask the compiler to align a variable or field to the maximum
useful alignment for the target machine you are compiling for.  For
example, you could write:

<PRE>
short array[3] __attribute__ ((aligned));
</PRE>

Whenever you leave out the alignment factor in an <CODE>aligned</CODE> attribute
specification, the compiler automatically sets the alignment for the declared
variable or field to the largest alignment which is ever used for any data
type on the target machine you are compiling for.  Doing this can often make
copy operations more efficient, because the compiler can use whatever
instructions copy the biggest chunks of memory when performing copies to
or from the variables or fields that you have aligned this way.

The <CODE>aligned</CODE> attribute can only increase the alignment; but you
can decrease it by specifying <CODE>packed</CODE> as well.  See below.

Note that the effectiveness of <CODE>aligned</CODE> attributes may be limited
by inherent limitations in your linker.  On many systems, the linker is
only able to arrange for variables to be aligned up to a certain maximum
alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum supported alignment may
be very very small.)  If your linker is only able to align variables
up to a maximum of 8 byte alignment, then specifying <CODE>aligned(16)</CODE>
in an <CODE>__attribute__</CODE> will still only provide you with 8 byte
alignment.  See your linker documentation for further information.

<A NAME="IDX368"></A>
<DT><CODE>mode (<VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>This attribute specifies the data type for the declaration--whichever
type corresponds to the mode <VAR>mode</VAR>.  This in effect lets you
request an integer or floating point type according to its width.

You may also specify a mode of <SAMP>`byte'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`__byte__'</SAMP> to
indicate the mode corresponding to a one-byte integer, <SAMP>`word'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`__word__'</SAMP> for the mode of a one-word integer, and <SAMP>`pointer'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`__pointer__'</SAMP> for the mode used to represent pointers.

<A NAME="IDX369"></A>
<DT><CODE>nocommon</CODE>
<DD>This attribute specifies requests GNU CC not to place a variable
"common" but instead to allocate space for it directly.  If you
specify the <SAMP>`-fno-common'</SAMP> flag, GNU CC will do this for all
variables.

Specifying the <CODE>nocommon</CODE> attribute for a variable provides an
initialization of zeros.  A variable may only be initialized in one
source file.

<A NAME="IDX370"></A>
<DT><CODE>packed</CODE>
<DD>The <CODE>packed</CODE> attribute specifies that a variable or structure field
should have the smallest possible alignment--one byte for a variable,
and one bit for a field, unless you specify a larger value with the
<CODE>aligned</CODE> attribute.

Here is a structure in which the field <CODE>x</CODE> is packed, so that it
immediately follows <CODE>a</CODE>:

<PRE>
struct foo
{
  char a;
  int x[2] __attribute__ ((packed));
};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX371"></A>
<DT><CODE>section ("section-name")</CODE>
<DD>Normally, the compiler places the objects it generates in sections like
<CODE>data</CODE> and <CODE>bss</CODE>.  Sometimes, however, you need additional sections,
or you need certain particular variables to appear in special sections,
for example to map to special hardware.  The <CODE>section</CODE>
attribute specifies that a variable (or function) lives in a particular
section.  For example, this small program uses several specific section names:

<PRE>
struct duart a __attribute__ 
         ((section ("DUART_A"))) = { 0 };
struct duart b __attribute__ 
         ((section ("DUART_B"))) = { 0 };
char stack[10000] __attribute__ 
         ((section ("STACK"))) = { 0 };
int init_data_copy __attribute__ 
         ((section ("INITDATACOPY"))) = 0;

main()
{
  /* Initialize stack pointer */
  init_sp (stack + sizeof (stack));

  /* Initialize initialized data */
  memcpy (&#38;init_data_copy, &#38;data, &#38;edata - &#38;data);

  /* Turn on the serial ports */
  init_duart (&#38;a);
  init_duart (&#38;b);
}
</PRE>

Use the <CODE>section</CODE> attribute with an <EM>initialized</EM> definition
of a <EM>global</EM> variable, as shown in the example.  GNU CC issues
a warning and otherwise ignores the <CODE>section</CODE> attribute in
uninitialized variable declarations.

You may only use the <CODE>section</CODE> attribute with a fully initialized
global definition because of the way linkers work.  The linker requires
each object be defined once, with the exception that uninitialized
variables tentatively go in the <CODE>common</CODE> (or <CODE>bss</CODE>) section
and can be multiply "defined".  You can force a variable to be
initialized with the <SAMP>`-fno-common'</SAMP> flag or the <CODE>nocommon</CODE>
attribute.

Some file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the <CODE>section</CODE>
attribute is not available on all platforms.
If you need to map the entire contents of a module to a particular
section, consider using the facilities of the linker instead.

<DT><CODE>transparent_union</CODE>
<DD>This attribute, attached to a function argument variable which is a
union, means to pass the argument in the same way that the first union
member would be passed.  You can also use this attribute on a
<CODE>typedef</CODE> for a union data type; then it applies to all function
arguments with that type.

<DT><CODE>unused</CODE>
<DD>This attribute, attached to a variable, means that the variable is meant
to be possibly unused.  GNU CC will not produce a warning for this
variable.

<DT><CODE>weak</CODE>
<DD>The <CODE>weak</CODE> attribute is described in See section <A HREF="usegcc_79.html#SEC82">Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>.
</DL>
<P>
To specify multiple attributes, separate them by commas within the
double parentheses: for example, <SAMP>`__attribute__ ((aligned (16),
packed))'</SAMP>.
