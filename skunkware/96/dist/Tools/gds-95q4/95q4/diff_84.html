<P>
Here are some ideas for improving GNU <CODE>diff</CODE> and <CODE>patch</CODE>.  The
GNU project has identified some improvements as potential programming
projects for volunteers.  You can also help by reporting any bugs that
you find.
<P>
If you are a programmer and would like to contribute something to the
GNU project, please consider volunteering for one of these projects.  If
you are seriously contemplating work, please write to
<SAMP>`gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu'</SAMP> to coordinate with other volunteers.
