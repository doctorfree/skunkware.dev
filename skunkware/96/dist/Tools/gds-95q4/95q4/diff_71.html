<P>
Below is a summary of all of the options that GNU <CODE>cmp</CODE> accepts.
Most options have two equivalent names, one of which is a single letter
preceded by <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, and the other of which is a long name preceded by
<SAMP>`--'</SAMP>.  Multiple single letter options (unless they take an
argument) can be combined into a single command line word: <SAMP>`-cl'</SAMP> is
equivalent to <SAMP>`-c -l'</SAMP>.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`-c'</SAMP>
<DD>Print the differing characters.  Display control characters as a
<SAMP>`^'</SAMP> followed by a letter of the alphabet and precede characters
that have the high bit set with <SAMP>`M-'</SAMP> (which stands for "meta").

<DT><SAMP>`--ignore-initial=<VAR>bytes</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>Ignore any differences in the the first <VAR>bytes</VAR> bytes of the input files.
Treat files with fewer than <VAR>bytes</VAR> bytes as if they are empty.

<DT><SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>
<DD>Print the (decimal) offsets and (octal) values of all differing bytes.

<DT><SAMP>`--print-chars'</SAMP>
<DD>Print the differing characters.  Display control characters as a
<SAMP>`^'</SAMP> followed by a letter of the alphabet and precede characters
that have the high bit set with <SAMP>`M-'</SAMP> (which stands for "meta").

<DT><SAMP>`--quiet'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`-s'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`--silent'</SAMP>
<DD>Do not print anything; only return an exit status indicating whether
the files differ.

<DT><SAMP>`--verbose'</SAMP>
<DD>Print the (decimal) offsets and (octal) values of all differing bytes.

<DT><SAMP>`-v'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`--version'</SAMP>
<DD>Output the version number of <CODE>cmp</CODE>.
