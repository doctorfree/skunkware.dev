<P>
Wildcards can be used in the commands of a rule, where they are expanded
by the shell.  For example, here is a rule to delete all the object files:
<P>
<PRE>
clean:
        rm -f *.o
<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
Wildcards are also useful in the dependencies of a rule.  With the
following rule in the makefile, <SAMP>`make print'</SAMP> will print all the
<SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> files that have changed since the last time you printed them:
<P>
<PRE>
print: *.c
        lpr -p $?
        touch print
</PRE>
<A NAME="IDX123"></A>
<A NAME="IDX124"></A>
<A NAME="IDX125"></A>
<P>
This rule uses <TT>`print'</TT> as an empty target file; see section <A HREF="make_34.html#SEC33">Empty Target Files to Record Events</A>.  (The automatic variable
<SAMP>`$?'</SAMP> is used to print only those files that have changed; see
section <A HREF="make_95.html#SEC94">Automatic Variables</A>.)<P>
Wildcard expansion does not happen when you define a variable.  Thus, if
you write this:
<P>
<PRE>
objects = *.o
</PRE>
<P>
then the value of the variable <CODE>objects</CODE> is the actual string
<SAMP>`*.o'</SAMP>.  However, if you use the value of <CODE>objects</CODE> in a target,
dependency or command, wildcard expansion will take place at that time.
To set <CODE>objects</CODE> to the expansion, instead use:
<P>
<PRE>
objects := $(wildcard *.o)
</PRE>
<P>
See section <A HREF="make_25.html#SEC24">The Function <CODE>wildcard</CODE></A>.
