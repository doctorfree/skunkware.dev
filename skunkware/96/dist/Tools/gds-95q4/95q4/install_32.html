<P>
The QIC-24 tape included with your Developer's Kit contains source
code for all the programs.
Most DOS systems cannot read this tape; you probably need to find a
Unix system to read it.
<P>
You need about 71 megabytes of free disk space to hold the source code.
To extract the source code into the current working directory on most
Unix machines, execute a command like this:
<P>
<PRE>
dd if=<VAR>tapedev</VAR> | compress -d | tar xvf -
</PRE>
<P>
<VAR>tapedev</VAR> stands for the device name for the tape drive.  For
example, on most Sun workstations, the device name for the QIC-24
tape drive is <TT>`/dev/rst8'</TT>.  Contact your system administrator for
the correct tape device for your system.
<P>
Please contact Cygnus Support at +1 415 903 1401 if you would like
the source code in another form.
