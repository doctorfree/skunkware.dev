<P>
To prepare to use <CODE>make</CODE>, you must write a file called
the <DFN>makefile</DFN> that describes the relationships among files
in your program and provides commands for updating each file.
In a program, typically, the executable file is updated from object
files, which are in turn made by compiling source files.<P>
Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files,
this simple shell command:
<P>
<PRE>
make
</PRE>
<P>
suffices to perform all necessary recompilations.  The <CODE>make</CODE> program
uses the makefile data base and the last-modification times of the files to
decide which of the files need to be updated.  For each of those files, it
issues the commands recorded in the data base.
<P>
You can provide command line arguments to <CODE>make</CODE> to control which
files should be recompiled, or how.  See section <A HREF="make_79.html#SEC78">How to Run <CODE>make</CODE></A>.
