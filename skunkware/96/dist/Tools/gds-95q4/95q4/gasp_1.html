<P>
The primary purpose of the GNU assembler is to assemble the output of
other programs--notably compilers.  When you have to hand-code
specialized routines in assembly, that means the GNU assembler is
an unfriendly processor: it has no directives for macros, conditionals,
or many other conveniences that you might expect.
<P>
In some cases you can simply use the C preprocessor, or a generalized
preprocessor like M4; but this can be awkward, since none of these
things are designed with assembly in mind.
<P>
GASP fills this need.  It is expressly designed to provide the
facilities you need with hand-coded assembly code.  Implementing it as a
preprocessor, rather than part of the assembler, allows the maximum
flexibility: you can use it with hand-coded assembly, without paying a
penalty of added complexity in the assembler you use for compiler
output.
<P>
Here is a small example to give the flavor of GASP.  This input to
