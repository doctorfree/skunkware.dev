<P>
You can specify the name to be used in the assembler code for a C
function or variable by writing the <CODE>asm</CODE> (or <CODE>__asm__</CODE>)
keyword after the declarator as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
int foo asm ("myfoo") = 2;
</PRE>
<P>
This specifies that the name to be used for the variable <CODE>foo</CODE> in
the assembler code should be <SAMP>`myfoo'</SAMP> rather than the usual
<SAMP>`_foo'</SAMP>.
<P>
On systems where an underscore is normally prepended to the name of a C
function or variable, this feature allows you to define names for the
linker that do not start with an underscore.
<P>
You cannot use <CODE>asm</CODE> in this way in a function <EM>definition</EM>; but
you can get the same effect by writing a declaration for the function
before its definition and putting <CODE>asm</CODE> there, like this:
<P>
<PRE>
extern func () asm ("FUNC");

func (x, y)
     int x, y;
...
</PRE>
<P>
It is up to you to make sure that the assembler names you choose do not
conflict with any other assembler symbols.  Also, you must not use a
register name; that would produce completely invalid assembler code.  GNU
CC does not as yet have the ability to store static variables in registers.
Perhaps that will be added.
