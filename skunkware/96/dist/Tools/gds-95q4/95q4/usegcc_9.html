<P>
C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes <SAMP>`.C'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`.cc'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`cpp'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`.cxx'</SAMP>; preprocessed C++ files use the
suffix <SAMP>`.ii'</SAMP>.  GNU CC recognizes files with these names and
compiles them as C++ programs even if you call the compiler the same way
as for compiling C programs (usually with the name <CODE>gcc</CODE>).

<P>
However, C++ programs often require class libraries as well as a
compiler that understands the C++ language--and under some
circumstances, you might want to compile programs from standard input,
or otherwise without a suffix that flags them as C++ programs.
<CODE>g++</CODE> is a program that calls GNU CC with the default language
set to C++, and automatically specifies linking against the GNU class
library libg++.

<A NAME="REF1" HREF="usegcc_foot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A> On many systems, the script <CODE>g++</CODE> is also
installed with the name <CODE>c++</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
<P>
When you compile C++ programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for C++ programs.
See section <A HREF="usegcc_10.html#SEC13">Options Controlling C Dialect</A>, for
explanations of options for languages related to C.
See section <A HREF="usegcc_11.html#SEC14">Options Controlling C++ Dialect</A>, for
explanations of options that are meaningful only for C++ programs.
