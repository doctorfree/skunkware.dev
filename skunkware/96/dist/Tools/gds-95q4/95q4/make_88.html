<H2><A NAME="SEC87" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC87">Using Implicit Rules</A></H2>
<P>
To allow <CODE>make</CODE> to find a customary method for updating a target file,
all you have to do is refrain from specifying commands yourself.  Either
write a rule with no command lines, or don't write a rule at all.  Then
<CODE>make</CODE> will figure out which implicit rule to use based on which
kind of source file exists or can be made.
<P>
For example, suppose the makefile looks like this:
<P>
<PRE>
foo : foo.o bar.o
        cc -o foo foo.o bar.o $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
</PRE>
<P>
Because you mention <TT>`foo.o'</TT> but do not give a rule for it, <CODE>make</CODE>
will automatically look for an implicit rule that tells how to update it.
This happens whether or not the file <TT>`foo.o'</TT> currently exists.
<P>
If an implicit rule is found, it can supply both commands and one or
more dependencies (the source files).  You would want to write a rule
for <TT>`foo.o'</TT> with no command lines if you need to specify additional
dependencies, such as header files, that the implicit rule cannot
supply.
<P>
Each implicit rule has a target pattern and dependency patterns.  There may
be many implicit rules with the same target pattern.  For example, numerous
rules make <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> files: one, from a <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> file with the C compiler;
another, from a <SAMP>`.p'</SAMP> file with the Pascal compiler; and so on.  The rule
that actually applies is the one whose dependencies exist or can be made.
So, if you have a file <TT>`foo.c'</TT>, <CODE>make</CODE> will run the C compiler;
otherwise, if you have a file <TT>`foo.p'</TT>, <CODE>make</CODE> will run the Pascal
compiler; and so on.
<P>
Of course, when you write the makefile, you know which implicit rule you
want <CODE>make</CODE> to use, and you know it will choose that one because you
know which possible dependency files are supposed to exist.
See section <A HREF="make_89.html#SEC88">Catalogue of Implicit Rules</A>,
for a catalogue of all the predefined implicit rules.
<P>
Above, we said an implicit rule applies if the required dependencies "exist
or can be made".  A file "can be made" if it is mentioned explicitly in
the makefile as a target or a dependency, or if an implicit rule can be
recursively found for how to make it.  When an implicit dependency is the
result of another implicit rule, we say that <DFN>chaining</DFN> is occurring.
See section <A HREF="make_91.html#SEC90">Chains of Implicit Rules</A>.
<P>
In general, <CODE>make</CODE> searches for an implicit rule for each target, and
for each double-colon rule, that has no commands.  A file that is mentioned
only as a dependency is considered a target whose rule specifies nothing,
so implicit rule search happens for it.  See section <A HREF="make_101.html#SEC100">Implicit Rule Search Algorithm</A>, for the
details of how the search is done.
<P>
Note that explicit dependencies do not influence implicit rule search.
For example, consider this explicit rule:
<P>
<PRE>
foo.o: foo.p
</PRE>
<P>
The dependency on <TT>`foo.p'</TT> does not necessarily mean that
<CODE>make</CODE> will remake <TT>`foo.o'</TT> according to the implicit rule to
make an object file, a <TT>`.o'</TT> file, from a Pascal source file, a
<TT>`.p'</TT> file.  For example, if <TT>`foo.c'</TT> also exists, the implicit
rule to make an object file from a C source file is used instead,
because it appears before the Pascal rule in the list of predefined
implicit rules (see section <A HREF="make_89.html#SEC88">Catalogue of Implicit Rules</A>).
<P>
If you do not want an implicit rule to be used for a target that has no
commands, you can give that target empty commands by writing a semicolon
(see section <A HREF="make_55.html#SEC54">Using Empty Commands</A>).
