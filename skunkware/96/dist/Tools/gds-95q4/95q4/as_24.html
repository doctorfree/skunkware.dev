<P>
The <CODE>as</CODE> internal preprocessor:
<A NAME="IDX83"></A>
<UL>
<LI>
adjusts and removes extra whitespace.  It leaves one space or tab before
the keywords on a line, and turns any other whitespace on the line into
a single space.

<A NAME="IDX84"></A>
<LI>
removes all comments, replacing them with a single space, or an
appropriate number of newlines.

<A NAME="IDX85"></A>
<LI>
converts character constants into the appropriate numeric values.
</UL>
<P>
It does not do macro processing, include file handling, or
anything else you may get from your C compiler's preprocessor.  You can
do include file processing with the <CODE>.include</CODE> directive
(see section <A HREF="as_91.html#SEC93"><CODE>.include "<VAR>file</CODE>"</VAR></A>).  You can use the GNU C compiler driver
to get other "CPP" style preprocessing, by giving the input file a
<SAMP>`.S'</SAMP> suffix.  See section `Options Controlling the Kind of Output' in <CITE>Using GNU CC</CITE>.
<P>
Excess whitespace, comments, and character constants
cannot be used in the portions of the input text that are not
preprocessed.
<A NAME="IDX86"></A>
<A NAME="IDX87"></A>
<A NAME="IDX88"></A>
<A NAME="IDX89"></A>
<P>
If the first line of an input file is <CODE>#NO_APP</CODE> or if you use the
<SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> option, whitespace and comments are not removed from the input file.
Within an input file, you can ask for whitespace and comment removal in
specific portions of the by putting a line that says <CODE>#APP</CODE> before the
text that may contain whitespace or comments, and putting a line that says
<CODE>#NO_APP</CODE> after this text.  This feature is mainly intend to support
<CODE>asm</CODE> statements in compilers whose output is otherwise free of comments
and whitespace.
