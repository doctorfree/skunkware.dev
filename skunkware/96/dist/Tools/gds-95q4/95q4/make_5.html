<P>
You need a file called a <DFN>makefile</DFN> to tell <CODE>make</CODE> what to do.
Most often, the makefile tells <CODE>make</CODE> how to compile and link a
program.

<P>
In this chapter, we will discuss a simple makefile that describes how to
compile and link a text editor which consists of eight C source files
and three header files.  The makefile can also tell <CODE>make</CODE> how to
run miscellaneous commands when explicitly asked (for example, to remove
certain files as a clean-up operation).  To see a more complex example
of a makefile, see section <A HREF="make_117.html#SEC116">Complex Makefile Example</A>.
<P>
When <CODE>make</CODE> recompiles the editor, each changed C source file
must be recompiled.  If a header file has changed, each C source file
that includes the header file must be recompiled to be safe.  Each
compilation produces an object file corresponding to the source file.
Finally, if any source file has been recompiled, all the object files,
whether newly made or saved from previous compilations, must be linked
together to produce the new executable editor.
