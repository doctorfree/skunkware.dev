<P>
The <SAMP>`-B'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`--ignore-blank-lines'</SAMP> options ignore insertions
or deletions of blank lines.  These options normally affect only lines
that are completely empty; they do not affect lines that look empty but
contain space or tab characters.  With these options, for example, a
file containing
<PRE>
1.  A point is that which has no part.

2.  A line is breadthless length.
-- Euclid, The Elements, I
</PRE>
is considered identical to a file containing
<PRE>
1.  A point is that which has no part.
2.  A line is breadthless length.
