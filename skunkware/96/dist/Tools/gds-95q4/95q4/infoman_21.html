<P>
If you have not used <SAMP>`--no-pointer-validate'</SAMP> to suppress
validation, Makeinfo will check the validity of the final info file.
Mostly, this means ensuring that nodes you have referenced really exist.
Here is a complete list of what is checked:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
If a node reference such as <CODE>Prev</CODE>, <CODE>Next</CODE> or <CODE>Up</CODE> is a
reference to a node in this file (i.e., not an external reference such
as <SAMP>`(DIR)'</SAMP>), then the referenced node must exist.

<LI>
In a given node, if the node referenced by the <CODE>Prev</CODE> is different
than the node referenced by the <CODE>Up</CODE>, then the node referenced by
the <CODE>Prev</CODE> must have a <CODE>Next</CODE> which references this node.

<LI>
Every node except <CODE>Top</CODE> must have an <CODE>Up</CODE> field.

<LI>
The node referenced by <CODE>Up</CODE> must contain a reference to this node,
other than a <CODE>Next</CODE> reference.  Obviously, this includes menu items
and followed references.

<LI>
If the <CODE>Next</CODE> reference is not the same as the <CODE>Next</CODE>
reference of the <CODE>Up</CODE> reference, then the node referenced by
<CODE>Next</CODE> must have a <CODE>Prev</CODE> reference pointing back at this
node.  This rule still allows the last node in a section to point to the
first node of the next chapter.
