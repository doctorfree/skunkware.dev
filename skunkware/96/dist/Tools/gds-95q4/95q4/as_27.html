<P>
A <DFN>symbol</DFN> is one or more characters chosen from the set of all
letters (both upper and lower case), digits and the three characters
<SAMP>`_.$'</SAMP>.
On most machines, you can also use <CODE>$</CODE> in symbol names; exceptions
are noted in section <A HREF="as_126.html#SEC128">Machine Dependent Features</A>.
No symbol may begin with a digit.  Case is significant.
There is no length limit: all characters are significant.  Symbols are
delimited by characters not in that set, or by the beginning of a file
(since the source program must end with a newline, the end of a file is
not a possible symbol delimiter).  See section <A HREF="as_43.html#SEC43">Symbols</A>.
