<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC11">Rules for Cleaning the Directory</A></H2>
<P>
Compiling a program is not the only thing you might want to write rules
for.  Makefiles commonly tell how to do a few other things besides
compiling a program: for example, how to delete all the object files
and executables so that the directory is <SAMP>`clean'</SAMP>.
<A NAME="IDX47"></A>
<P>
Here is how we
could write a <CODE>make</CODE> rule for cleaning our example editor:
<P>
<PRE>
clean:
        rm edit $(objects)
</PRE>
<P>
In practice, we might want to write the rule in a somewhat more
complicated manner to handle unanticipated situations.  We would do this:
<P>
<PRE>
.PHONY : clean
clean :
        -rm edit $(objects)
</PRE>
<P>
This prevents <CODE>make</CODE> from getting confused by an actual file
called <TT>`clean'</TT> and causes it to continue in spite of errors from
<CODE>rm</CODE>.  (See section <A HREF="make_32.html#SEC31">Phony Targets</A>, and section <A HREF="make_47.html#SEC46">Errors in Commands</A>.)
<P>
A rule such as this should not be placed at the beginning of the
makefile, because we do not want it to run by default!  Thus, in the
example makefile, we want the rule for <CODE>edit</CODE>, which recompiles
the editor, to remain the default goal.
<P>
Since <CODE>clean</CODE> is not a dependency of <CODE>edit</CODE>, this rule will not
run at all if we give the command <SAMP>`make'</SAMP> with no arguments.  In
order to make the rule run, we have to type <SAMP>`make clean'</SAMP>.
See section <A HREF="make_79.html#SEC78">How to Run <CODE>make</CODE></A>.
