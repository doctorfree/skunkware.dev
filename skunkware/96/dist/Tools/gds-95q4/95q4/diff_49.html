<P>
Groups of lines that differ in two or three of the input files are
called <DFN>diff3 hunks</DFN>, by analogy with <CODE>diff</CODE> hunks
(see section <A HREF="diff_3.html#SEC3">Hunks</A>).  If all three input files differ in a <CODE>diff3</CODE>
hunk, the hunk is called a <DFN>three-way hunk</DFN>; if just two input files
differ, it is a <DFN>two-way hunk</DFN>.
<P>
As with <CODE>diff</CODE>, several solutions are possible.  When comparing the
files <SAMP>`A'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`B'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`C'</SAMP>, <CODE>diff3</CODE> normally finds
<CODE>diff3</CODE> hunks by merging the two-way hunks output by the two
commands <SAMP>`diff A B'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`diff A C'</SAMP>.  This does not necessarily
minimize the size of the output, but exceptions should be rare.
<P>
For example, suppose <TT>`F'</TT> contains the three lines <SAMP>`a'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`b'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`f'</SAMP>, <TT>`G'</TT> contains the lines <SAMP>`g'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`g'</SAMP>, and <TT>`H'</TT> contains the lines <SAMP>`a'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`h'</SAMP>.  <SAMP>`diff3 F G H'</SAMP> might output the following:

<P>
because it found a two-way hunk containing <SAMP>`a'</SAMP> in the first and
third files and <SAMP>`g'</SAMP> in the second file, then the single line
<SAMP>`b'</SAMP> common to all three files, then a three-way hunk containing
the last line of each file.
