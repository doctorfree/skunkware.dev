<P>
Cygnus Support, founded in 1989, provides commercial support for free
software.  <EM>Why free software?</EM> Free software is fast, powerful,
and more portable than its proprietary counterparts.  It evolves faster
because users who want to make improvements are free to do so.
<P>
Cygnus Support has become the leading development organization of the
GNU tools, contributing more than 50% of ongoing development. In
addition to in-house development, Cygnus leverages the increasing
cumulative pool of functionality available as public domain software on
the Internet, creating a virtual community of developers. Building upon
and contributing to this effort, Cygnus raises the level of
functionality available to the entire industry.
<P>
The problem with free software has always been that your company's
programmers and engineers must spend time maintaining the tools as
well as using them, which ties up company resources. Cygnus frees up
those resources by supplying products and services, which allows you to
use state-of-the-art tools without the problems of maintenance. You can
now choose to use free software and get the advantages of powerful and
prompt support, combining the best of both.
<P>
Our team of experienced engineers include the leading architects for
G++, GDB, GAS, and BFD. We use one of the most comprehensive
bug-reporting and tracking software in the business, PRMS.
<P>
Because all our improvements are also free software, you can distribute
them widely within your organization, or to your customers, without
extra cost. No unwieldy licenses to manage, and no worries about buying
extra copies.
<P>
Cygnus makes sure that our customers' problems get solved the right way.
No grungy little programs, no klugey fixes that don't generalize, no
work-arounds that end up being features instead of temporary situations.
