<P>
A <DFN>Problem Report</DFN> is a message that describes a problem you are
having with a body of work.  <CODE>send-pr</CODE> organizes this message into
a form which can be understood and automatically processed by PRMS,
the GNU Problem Report Management System.  A Problem Report is
organized into <DFN>fields</DFN> which contain data describing you, your
organization, and the problem you are announcing (see section <A HREF="send-pr_4.html#SEC3">Problem Report format</A>).  Problem Reports go through several defined states in
their lifetimes, from <DFN>open</DFN> to <DFN>closed</DFN> (see section <A HREF="send-pr_3.html#SEC2">States of Problem Reports</A>).
