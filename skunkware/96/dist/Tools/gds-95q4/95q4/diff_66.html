<P>
Sometimes when comparing two directories, the first directory contains a
file that the second directory does not.  If you give <CODE>diff</CODE> the
<SAMP>`-N'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--new-file'</SAMP> option, it outputs a diff that deletes
the contents of this file.  By default, <CODE>patch</CODE> leaves an empty
file after applying such a diff.  The <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--remove-empty-files'</SAMP> option to <CODE>patch</CODE> deletes output files
that are empty after applying the diff.
