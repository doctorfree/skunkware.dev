<P>
<DFN>Stringification</DFN> means turning a code fragment into a string constant
whose contents are the text for the code fragment.  For example,
stringifying <SAMP>`foo (z)'</SAMP> results in <SAMP>`"foo (z)"'</SAMP>.
<P>
In the C preprocessor, stringification is an option available when macro
arguments are substituted into the macro definition.  In the body of the
definition, when an argument name appears, the character <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> before
the name specifies stringification of the corresponding actual argument
when it is substituted at that point in the definition.  The same argument
may be substituted in other places in the definition without
stringification if the argument name appears in those places with no
<SAMP>`#'</SAMP>.
<P>
Here is an example of a macro definition that uses stringification:
<P>
<PRE>
#define WARN_IF(EXP) \
do { if (EXP) \
        fprintf (stderr, "Warning: " #EXP "\n"); } \
while (0)
</PRE>
<P>
Here the actual argument for <SAMP>`EXP'</SAMP> is substituted once as given,
into the <SAMP>`if'</SAMP> statement, and once as stringified, into the
argument to <SAMP>`fprintf'</SAMP>.  The <SAMP>`do'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`while (0)'</SAMP> are
a kludge to make it possible to write <SAMP>`WARN_IF (<VAR>arg</VAR>);'</SAMP>,
which the resemblance of <SAMP>`WARN_IF'</SAMP> to a function would make
C programmers want to do; see section <A HREF="cpp_22.html#SEC23">Swallowing the Semicolon</A>.
<P>
The stringification feature is limited to transforming one macro argument
into one string constant: there is no way to combine the argument with
other text and then stringify it all together.  But the example above shows
how an equivalent result can be obtained in ANSI Standard C using the
feature that adjacent string constants are concatenated as one string
constant.  The preprocessor stringifies the actual value of <SAMP>`EXP'</SAMP> 
into a separate string constant, resulting in text like
<P>
<PRE>
do { if (x == 0) \
        fprintf (stderr, "Warning: " "x == 0" "\n"); } \
while (0)
</PRE>
<P>
but the C compiler then sees three consecutive string constants and
concatenates them into one, producing effectively
<P>
<PRE>
do { if (x == 0) \
        fprintf (stderr, "Warning: x == 0\n"); } \
while (0)
</PRE>
<P>
Stringification in C involves more than putting doublequote characters
around the fragment; it is necessary to put backslashes in front of all
doublequote characters, and all backslashes in string and character
constants, in order to get a valid C string constant with the proper
contents.  Thus, stringifying <SAMP>`p = "foo\n";'</SAMP> results in <SAMP>`"p =
\"foo\\n\";"'</SAMP>.  However, backslashes that are not inside of string or
character constants are not duplicated: <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP> by itself stringifies to
<SAMP>`"\n"'</SAMP>.
<P>
Whitespace (including comments) in the text being stringified is handled
according to precise rules.  All leading and trailing whitespace is ignored.
Any sequence of whitespace in the middle of the text is converted to
a single space in the stringified result.
