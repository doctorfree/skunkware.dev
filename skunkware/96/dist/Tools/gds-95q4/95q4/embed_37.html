<P>
Before you can use the Cygnus Developer's Kit to build your programs for
IDT boards, you need a C library and C run-time initialization
code.  Unless you already have suitable libraries of your own, you must
integrate the Cygnus C libraries with low-level code supplied by
IDT.  This low-level code initializes the C run-time environment,
and describes the hardware interface to the Cygnus C libraries.
<P>
To begin with, make sure you have the following C and assembly source
files from IDT:
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>C source files:</EM>
drv_8254.c         sys.c           
idt_int_hand.c     syscalls.c      
idtfpip.c          timer_int_hand.c
sbrk.c

<EM>C header files:</EM>
dpac.h             idtio.h         
excepthdr.h        idtmon.h        
fpip.h             iregdef.h       
i8254.h            saunder.h       
idt_entrypt.h      setjmp.h        
idtcpu.h        

<EM>Assembler files:</EM>
idt_csu.S          lnkexit.S   
idt_except.S       lnkhelp.S   
idtfpreg.S         lnkinstal.S 
idtmem.S           lnkio.S     
idttlb.S           lnkioctl.S  
idtwbf.S           lnkjmp.S    
lnkatb.S           lnkmem.S    
lnkcach.S          lnknimp.S   
lnkchar.S          lnkprint.S  
lnkcio.S           lnksbrk.S   
lnkcli.S           lnkstr.S    
</PRE>
<P>
Then follow these steps to integrate the low-level IDT code with
your Cygnus Developer's Kit:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
IDT supplies the C run-time initialization code in the file
<TT>`idt_csu.S'</TT>.  Since GNU CC expects to find the initialization
module under the name <CODE>crt0.o</CODE>, rename the source file to match:

<PRE>
$ mv idt_csu.S crt0.S
</PRE>

<LI>
Edit the contents of <TT>`crt0.S'</TT>.  A few more instructions are needed
to ensure correct initialization, and to ensure that your programs exit
cleanly.  At the end of the file (after a comment including the text
<SAMP>`END I/O initialization'</SAMP>), look for these lines:

<PRE>
        jal     main

ENDFRAME(start)
</PRE>

Insert <SAMP>`move ra,zero'</SAMP> before <SAMP>`jal main'</SAMP> to mark the top of the
stack for the debugger, and add two lines after the call to <CODE>main</CODE>
to call the <CODE>exit</CODE> routine (before the <SAMP>`ENDFRAME(start)'</SAMP>), so
that the end of the file looks like this:

<PRE>
        move    ra,zero
        jal     main

        move    a0,v0
        jal     exit

ENDFRAME(start)
</PRE>

<LI>
Edit <TT>`syscalls.c'</TT>, the interface to the low-level routines required
by the C library, to remove the leading underbar from two identifiers:

<OL>
<LI>
Rename <CODE>_kill</CODE> to <CODE>kill</CODE>;

<LI>
Rename <CODE>_getpid</CODE> to <CODE>getpid</CODE>.
</OL>

<LI>
Edit <TT>`lnksbrk.S'</TT> to remove the definition of <CODE>_init_sbrk</CODE>;
this definition is not needed, since it is available in <TT>`sbrk.c'</TT>.
Delete the lines marked with <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> at the left margin below:

<PRE>
        .text
 
-FRAME(_init_sbrk,sp,0,ra)
-       j       ra
-ENDFRAME(_init_sbrk)
-
-
-
 FRAME(_init_file,sp,0,ra)
        j       ra
 ENDFRAME(_init_file)
</PRE>

<LI>
Use your Cygnus Developer's Kit to assemble the <SAMP>`.S'</SAMP> files, like
this (use the compiler driver <CODE>gcc</CODE> to permit C preprocessing).

<EM>For concreteness, these example commands assume the <CODE>mips</CODE>
(big-endian) variant of the configuration; if you ordered tools
configured for little-endian object code, type <SAMP>`mipsel'</SAMP> wherever the
examples show <SAMP>`mips'</SAMP>.</EM>


<PRE>
$ mips-idt-ecoff-gcc -g -c *.S
</PRE>

<LI>
Compile the <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> files.

One particular C source file, <TT>`drv_8254.c'</TT> requires two special
preprocessor symbol definitions: <SAMP>`-DCLANGUAGE -DTADD=0xBF800000'</SAMP>.
<EM>Be careful to type the constant value for <SAMP>`TADD'</SAMP> accurately;</EM>
the correct value is essential to allow the IDT board to
communicate over its serial port.

The two special preprocessor definitions make no difference to the other
C source files, so you can compile them all with one call to the
compiler, like this:

<PRE>
$ mips-idt-ecoff-gcc -g -O \
   -DCLANGUAGE -DTADD=0xBF800000 -c *.c
</PRE>

(The example is split across two lines simply due to formatting
constraints; you can type it on a single line instead of two lines
linked by a <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>, of course.)

<LI>
Add the new object files to the C library archive, <TT>`libc.a'</TT>, from
your Cygnus Developer's Kit.  Assuming you installed the Kit in
<TT>`/usr/cygnus/'</TT> as we recommend:

<PRE>
$ mips-idt-ecoff-ar rvs /usr/cygnus/progressive-94q1/\
H-<VAR>host</VAR>/mips-idt-ecoff/lib/libc.a *.o 
</PRE>

As before, you can omit the <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> and type a single line.
<SAMP>`H-<VAR>host</VAR>'</SAMP> stands for the string that identifies your host
configuration; for example, on a SPARC computer running SunOS
4.1.3, you'd actually type <SAMP>`H-sparc-sun-sunos4.1.3'</SAMP>.
</OL>
<P>
<H3>Linking with the GOFAST library</H3>
<P>
The GOFAST library is available with two interfaces; <CODE>GCC</CODE>
<SAMP>`-msoft-float'</SAMP> output places all arguments in registers, which (for
subroutines using <CODE>double</CODE> arguments) is compatible with the
interface identified as "Interface 1: all arguments in registers" in
the GOFAST documentation.  For full compatibility with all
GOFAST subroutines, you need to make a slight modification to
some of the subroutines in the GOFAST library.  
<P>
details.
<P>
If you purchase and install the GOFAST library, you can link your
code to that library in a number of different ways, depending on where
and how you install the library.
<P>
To focus on the issue of linking, the following examples assume you've
already built object modules with appropriate options (including
<SAMP>`-msoft-float'</SAMP>).
<P>
This is the simplest case; it assumes that you've installed the GOFAST
library as the file <TT>`fp.a'</TT> in the same directory where you do
development, as shown in the GOFAST documentation:
<P>
<PRE>
$ mips-idt-ecoff-gcc -o <VAR>prog</VAR> <VAR>prog</VAR>.o ... -lc fp.a
</PRE>
<P>
In a shared development environment, this example may be more realistic;
it assumes you've installed the GOFAST library as
<TT>`<VAR>ussdir</VAR>/libgofast.a'</TT>, where <VAR>ussdir</VAR> is any convenient
directory on your development system.
<P>
<PRE>
$ mips-idt-ecoff-gcc -o program program.o ... \
  -lc -L<VAR>ussdir</VAR> -lgofast
</PRE>
<P>
Finally, you can eliminate the need for a <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> option with a little
more setup, using an environment variable like this (the example assumes
you use a command shell compatible with the Bourne shell):
<P>
<PRE>
$ LIBRARY_PATH=<VAR>ussdir</VAR>; export LIBRARY_PATH

$ mips-idt-ecoff-gcc -o program program.o ... -lc -lgofast
</PRE>
<P>
As for the previous example, the GOFAST library here is installed in
<TT>`<VAR>ussdir</VAR>/libgofast.a'</TT>.  The environment variable
<CODE>LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> instructs <CODE>GCC</CODE> to look for the library in
<VAR>ussdir</VAR>.  (The syntax shown here for setting the environment
variable is the Unix Bourne Shell (<TT>`/bin/sh'</TT>) syntax; adjust as 
needed for your system.)
<P>
Notice that all the variations on linking with the GOFAST library
explicitly include <SAMP>`-lc'</SAMP> <EM>before</EM> the GOFAST library.
<SAMP>`-lc'</SAMP> is the standard C subroutine library; normally, you don't
have to specify this, since linking with that library is automatic.
<P>
When you link with an alternate software floating-point library,
however, the order of linking is important.  In this situation, specify
<SAMP>`-lc'</SAMP> <EM>to the left</EM> of the GOFAST library, to ensure that
standard library subroutines also use the GOFAST floating-point code.
<P>
<H3>Full compatibility with the GOFAST library</H3>
<P>
The <CODE>GCC</CODE> calling convention for functions whose first and second
arguments have type <CODE>float</CODE> is not completely compatible with the
definitions of those functions in the GOFAST library, as shipped.
<P>
These functions are affected:
<P>
<PRE>
fpcmp   fpadd   fpsub   fpmul   fpdiv   fpfmod
fpacos  fpasin  fpatan  fpatan2 fppow
</PRE>
<P>
Since the GOFAST library is normally shipped with source, you can
make these functions compatible with the <CODE>GCC</CODE> convention by adding
this instruction to the beginning of each affected function, then
rebuilding the library:
<P>
<PRE>
        move    $5,$6
</PRE>
