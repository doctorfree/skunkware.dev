<P>
Computer users often find occasion to ask how two files differ.  Perhaps
one file is a newer version of the other file.  Or maybe the two files
started out as identical copies but were changed by different people.
<P>
You can use the <CODE>diff</CODE> command to show differences between two
files, or each corresponding file in two directories.  <CODE>diff</CODE>
outputs differences between files line by line in any of several
formats, selectable by command line options.  This set of differences is
often called a <DFN>diff</DFN> or <DFN>patch</DFN>.  For files that are identical,
<CODE>diff</CODE> normally produces no output; for binary (non-text) files,
<CODE>diff</CODE> normally reports only that they are different.
<P>
You can use the <CODE>cmp</CODE> command to show the offsets and line numbers
where two files differ.  <CODE>cmp</CODE> can also show all the characters
that differ between the two files, side by side.  Another way to compare
two files character by character is the Emacs command <KBD>M-x
compare-windows</KBD>.  See section `Other Window' in <CITE>The GNU Emacs Manual</CITE>, for more information on that command.
<P>
You can use the <CODE>diff3</CODE> command to show differences among three
files.  When two people have made independent changes to a common
original, <CODE>diff3</CODE> can report the differences between the original
and the two changed versions, and can produce a merged file that
contains both persons' changes together with warnings about conflicts.
<P>
You can use the <CODE>sdiff</CODE> command to merge two files interactively.
<P>
You can use the set of differences produced by <CODE>diff</CODE> to distribute
updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
to the complete files.  Given <CODE>diff</CODE> output, you can use the
<CODE>patch</CODE> program to update, or <DFN>patch</DFN>, a copy of the file.  If you
think of <CODE>diff</CODE> as subtracting one file from another to produce
their difference, you can think of <CODE>patch</CODE> as adding the difference
to one file to reproduce the other.
<P>
This manual first concentrates on making diffs, and later shows how to
use diffs to update files.

GNU <CODE>diff</CODE> was written by Mike Haertel, David Hayes, Richard
Stallman, Len Tower, and Paul Eggert.  Wayne Davison designed and
implemented the unified output format.  The basic algorithm is described
in "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations", Eugene W. Myers,
<CITE>Algorithmica</CITE> Vol. 1 No. 2, 1986, pp. 251--266; and in "A File
Comparison Program", Webb Miller and Eugene W. Myers,
<CITE>Software--Practice and Experience</CITE> Vol. 15 No. 11, 1985,
pp. 1025--1040.
The algorithm was independently discovered as described in
"Algorithms for Approximate String Matching",
E. Ukkonen, <CITE>Information and Control</CITE> Vol. 64, 1985, pp. 100--118.

GNU <CODE>diff3</CODE> was written by Randy Smith.  GNU <CODE>sdiff</CODE> was
written by Thomas Lord.  GNU <CODE>cmp</CODE> was written by Torbjorn Granlund
and David MacKenzie.
<P>
<CODE>patch</CODE> was written mainly by Larry Wall; the GNU enhancements were
written mainly by Wayne Davison and David MacKenzie.  Parts of this
manual are adapted from a manual page written by Larry Wall, with his
