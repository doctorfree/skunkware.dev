<P>
Symbol names begin with a letter or with one of <SAMP>`._'</SAMP>.  On most
machines, you can also use <CODE>$</CODE> in symbol names; exceptions are
noted in section <A HREF="as_126.html#SEC128">Machine Dependent Features</A>.  That character may be followed by any
string of digits, letters, dollar signs (unless otherwise noted in
section <A HREF="as_126.html#SEC128">Machine Dependent Features</A>), and underscores.
For the AMD 29K family, <SAMP>`?'</SAMP> is also allowed in the
body of a symbol name, though not at its beginning.
<P>
Case of letters is significant: <CODE>foo</CODE> is a different symbol name
than <CODE>Foo</CODE>.
<P>
Each symbol has exactly one name.  Each name in an assembly language program
refers to exactly one symbol.  You may use that symbol name any number of times
in a program.

<H3>Local Symbol Names</H3>
<A NAME="IDX186"></A>
<A NAME="IDX187"></A>
<A NAME="IDX188"></A>
<A NAME="IDX189"></A>
<P>
Local symbols help compilers and programmers use names temporarily.
There are ten local symbol names, which are re-used throughout the
program.  You may refer to them using the names <SAMP>`0'</SAMP> <SAMP>`1'</SAMP>
... <SAMP>`9'</SAMP>.  To define a local symbol, write a label of the form
<SAMP>`<B>N</B>:'</SAMP> (where <B>N</B> represents any digit).  To refer to the most
recent previous definition of that symbol write <SAMP>`<B>N</B>b'</SAMP>, using the
same digit as when you defined the label.  To refer to the next
definition of a local label, write <SAMP>`<B>N</B>f'</SAMP>---where <B>N</B> gives you
a choice of 10 forward references.  The <SAMP>`b'</SAMP> stands for
"backwards" and the <SAMP>`f'</SAMP> stands for "forwards".
<P>
Local symbols are not emitted by the current GNU C compiler.
<P>
There is no restriction on how you can use these labels, but
remember that at any point in the assembly you can refer to at most
10 prior local labels and to at most 10 forward local labels.
<P>
Local symbol names are only a notation device.  They are immediately
transformed into more conventional symbol names before the assembler
uses them.  The symbol names stored in the symbol table, appearing in
error messages and optionally emitted to the object file have these
parts:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>L</CODE>
<DD>All local labels begin with <SAMP>`L'</SAMP>. Normally both <CODE>as</CODE> and
<CODE>ld</CODE> forget symbols that start with <SAMP>`L'</SAMP>. These labels are
used for symbols you are never intended to see.  If you use the
<SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> option then <CODE>as</CODE> retains these symbols in the
object file. If you also instruct <CODE>ld</CODE> to retain these symbols,
you may use them in debugging.

<DT><CODE><VAR>digit</VAR></CODE>
<DD>If the label is written <SAMP>`0:'</SAMP> then the digit is <SAMP>`0'</SAMP>.
If the label is written <SAMP>`1:'</SAMP> then the digit is <SAMP>`1'</SAMP>.
And so on up through <SAMP>`9:'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>^A</CODE>
<DD>This unusual character is included so you do not accidentally invent
a symbol of the same name.  The character has ASCII value
<SAMP>`\001'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE><EM>ordinal number</EM></CODE>
<DD>This is a serial number to keep the labels distinct.  The first
<SAMP>`0:'</SAMP> gets the number <SAMP>`1'</SAMP>; The 15th <SAMP>`0:'</SAMP> gets the
number <SAMP>`15'</SAMP>; <EM>etc.</EM>.  Likewise for the other labels <SAMP>`1:'</SAMP>
through <SAMP>`9:'</SAMP>.
</DL>
<P>
For instance, the first <CODE>1:</CODE> is named <CODE>L1^A1</CODE>, the 44th
<CODE>3:</CODE> is named <CODE>L3^A44</CODE>.
