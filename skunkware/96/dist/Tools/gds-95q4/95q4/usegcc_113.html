<P>
This section describes known problems that affect users of GNU CC.  Most
of these are not GNU CC bugs per se--if they were, we would fix them.
But the result for a user may be like the result of a bug.
<P>
Some of these problems are due to bugs in other software, some are
missing features that are too much work to add, and some are places
where people's opinions differ as to what is best.

<LI><A HREF="usegcc_121.html#SEC124">Standard Libraries</A>: GNU C uses the system C library, which might not be 
                           compliant with the ISO/ANSI C standard.
