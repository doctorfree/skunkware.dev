<P>
There is some trickery concerning the <SAMP>`mul'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`imul'</SAMP>
instructions that deserves mention.  The 16-, 32-, and 64-bit expanding
multiplies (base opcode <SAMP>`0xf6'</SAMP>; extension 4 for <SAMP>`mul'</SAMP> and 5
for <SAMP>`imul'</SAMP>) can be output only in the one operand form.  Thus,
<SAMP>`imul %ebx, %eax'</SAMP> does <EM>not</EM> select the expanding multiply;
the expanding multiply would clobber the <SAMP>`%edx'</SAMP> register, and this
would confuse <CODE>gcc</CODE> output.  Use <SAMP>`imul %ebx'</SAMP> to get the
64-bit product in <SAMP>`%edx:%eax'</SAMP>.
<P>
We have added a two operand form of <SAMP>`imul'</SAMP> when the first operand
is an immediate mode expression and the second operand is a register.
This is just a shorthand, so that, multiplying <SAMP>`%eax'</SAMP> by 69, for
example, can be done with <SAMP>`imul $69, %eax'</SAMP> rather than <SAMP>`imul
$69, %eax, %eax'</SAMP>.
