<H1><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="intro_toc.html#TOC8">Cygnus Support and the FSF</A></H1>
<P>
Cygnus Support and the Free Software Foundation cooperate on major
projects, such as the port of the GNU development tools to Solaris
2.  We look forward to continuing such cooperation in the future.
<P>
Cygnus maintains many programs and libraries <EM>for</EM> the FSF:
G++, GDB, GAS, the linker, GPROF, the binary
utilities, LIBG++, and the Binary File Descriptor libraries.  In
addition, Cygnus and the FSF share sources for other programs on a
regular basis.
<P>
Both Cygnus and the FSF agree that free software is the best way to
meet the industry's technical needs.  However, Cygnus and the FSF
have different missions.  Cygnus, as a for-profit company, concentrates
on meeting its customers' needs.  The FSF concentrates on meeting
the internal needs of the GNU project.
<P>
Therefore, Cygnus may not accept into our source tree certain FSF
changes until they are reworked into a form acceptable for our
customers' needs--for example, changes that reduce performance or
reliability on the software platforms we support.  Conversely, the
FSF may not accept changes from Cygnus that improve support for
only a limited group of users (Cygnus customers).
<P>
Also, Cygnus sometimes supports non-FSF code.  Our C subroutine
library is an example.  The FSF's version carries licensing
restrictions which are impractical for customers who write code for
embedded systems; as a result, we developed our own subroutine library,
LIBC.  The Cygnus C subroutine library, although also freely
redistributable, does not carry the licensing restrictions that would
inconvenience these customers.
<P>
Finally, although the FSF makes every effort to provide
high-quality releases, its development requirements take priority.  The
FSF regards software testing as the user community's contribution
to the GNU project.  Cygnus releases go through a quality assurance
cycle which is in large part driven by our knowledge of customer
requirements.
