<P>
Below is a summary of all of the options that GNU <CODE>diff3</CODE>
accepts.  Multiple single letter options (unless they take an argument)
can be combined into a single command line argument.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`-a'</SAMP>
<DD>Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if they
do not appear to be text.  See section <A HREF="diff_9.html#SEC9">Binary Files and Forcing Text Comparisons</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`-A'</SAMP>
<DD>Incorporate all changes from <VAR>older</VAR> to <VAR>yours</VAR> into <VAR>mine</VAR>,
surrounding all conflicts with bracket lines.
See section <A HREF="diff_53.html#SEC53">Marking Conflicts</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`-e'</SAMP>
<DD>Generate an <CODE>ed</CODE> script that incorporates all the changes from
<VAR>older</VAR> to <VAR>yours</VAR> into <VAR>mine</VAR>.  See section <A HREF="diff_52.html#SEC52">Selecting Which Changes to Incorporate</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`-E'</SAMP>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP>, except bracket lines from overlapping changes' first
and third files.
See section <A HREF="diff_53.html#SEC53">Marking Conflicts</A>.
With <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP>, an overlapping change looks like this:

<PRE>
&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60; <VAR>mine</VAR>
lines from <VAR>mine</VAR>
=======
lines from <VAR>yours</VAR>
&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; <VAR>yours</VAR>
</PRE>

<DT><SAMP>`--ed'</SAMP>
<DD>Generate an <CODE>ed</CODE> script that incorporates all the changes from
<VAR>older</VAR> to <VAR>yours</VAR> into <VAR>mine</VAR>.  See section <A HREF="diff_52.html#SEC52">Selecting Which Changes to Incorporate</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`--easy-only'</SAMP>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP>, except output only the nonoverlapping changes.
See section <A HREF="diff_52.html#SEC52">Selecting Which Changes to Incorporate</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`-i'</SAMP>
<DD>Generate <SAMP>`w'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`q'</SAMP> commands at the end of the <CODE>ed</CODE>
script for System V compatibility.  This option must be combined with
one of the <SAMP>`-AeExX3'</SAMP> options, and may not be combined with <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP>.
See section <A HREF="diff_56.html#SEC56">Saving the Changed File</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`--initial-tab'</SAMP>
<DD>Output a tab rather than two spaces before the text of a line in normal format.
This causes the alignment of tabs in the line to look normal.  See section <A HREF="diff_43.html#SEC43">Preserving Tabstop Alignment</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`-L <VAR>label</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`--label=<VAR>label</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>Use the label <VAR>label</VAR> for the brackets output by the <SAMP>`-A'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-X'</SAMP> options.  This option may be given up to three
times, one for each input file.  The default labels are the names of
the input files.  Thus <SAMP>`diff3 -L X -L Y -L Z -m A B C'</SAMP> acts like
<SAMP>`diff3 -m A B C'</SAMP>, except that the output looks like it came from
files named <SAMP>`X'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`Y'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`Z'</SAMP> rather than from files
named <SAMP>`A'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`B'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`C'</SAMP>.  See section <A HREF="diff_53.html#SEC53">Marking Conflicts</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`-m'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`--merge'</SAMP>
<DD>Apply the edit script to the first file and send the result to standard
output.  Unlike piping the output from <CODE>diff3</CODE> to <CODE>ed</CODE>, this
works even for binary files and incomplete lines.  <SAMP>`-A'</SAMP> is assumed
if no edit script option is specified.  See section <A HREF="diff_54.html#SEC54">Generating the Merged Output Directly</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`--overlap-only'</SAMP>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP>, except output only the overlapping changes.
See section <A HREF="diff_52.html#SEC52">Selecting Which Changes to Incorporate</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`--show-all'</SAMP>
<DD>Incorporate all unmerged changes from <VAR>older</VAR> to <VAR>yours</VAR> into
<VAR>mine</VAR>, surrounding all overlapping changes with bracket lines.
See section <A HREF="diff_53.html#SEC53">Marking Conflicts</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`--show-overlap'</SAMP>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP>, except bracket lines from overlapping changes' first
and third files.
See section <A HREF="diff_53.html#SEC53">Marking Conflicts</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`-T'</SAMP>
<DD>Output a tab rather than two spaces before the text of a line in normal format.
This causes the alignment of tabs in the line to look normal.  See section <A HREF="diff_43.html#SEC43">Preserving Tabstop Alignment</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`--text'</SAMP>
<DD>Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if they
do not appear to be text.  See section <A HREF="diff_9.html#SEC9">Binary Files and Forcing Text Comparisons</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`-v'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`--version'</SAMP>
<DD>Output the version number of <CODE>diff3</CODE>.

<DT><SAMP>`-x'</SAMP>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP>, except output only the overlapping changes.
See section <A HREF="diff_52.html#SEC52">Selecting Which Changes to Incorporate</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`-X'</SAMP>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP>, except output only the overlapping changes.
In other words, like <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP>, except bracket changes as in <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP>.
See section <A HREF="diff_53.html#SEC53">Marking Conflicts</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`-3'</SAMP>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP>, except output only the nonoverlapping changes.
See section <A HREF="diff_52.html#SEC52">Selecting Which Changes to Incorporate</A>.
