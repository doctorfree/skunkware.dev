<H2><A NAME="SEC74" HREF="usegcc_toc.html#TOC74">Macros with Variable Numbers of Arguments</A></H2>
<P>
In GNU C, a macro can accept a variable number of arguments, much as a
function can.  The syntax for defining the macro looks much like that
used for a function.  Here is an example:
<P>
<PRE>
#define eprintf(format, args...)  \
 fprintf (stderr, format , ## args)
</PRE>
<P>
Here <CODE>args</CODE> is a <DFN>rest argument</DFN>: it takes in zero or more
arguments, as many as the call contains.  All of them plus the commas
between them form the value of <CODE>args</CODE>, which is substituted into
the macro body where <CODE>args</CODE> is used.  Thus, we have this expansion:
<P>
<PRE>
eprintf ("%s:%d: ", input_file_name, line_number)
==>
fprintf (stderr, "%s:%d: " , input_file_name, line_number)
</PRE>
<P>
Note that the comma after the string constant comes from the definition
of <CODE>eprintf</CODE>, whereas the last comma comes from the value of
<CODE>args</CODE>.
<P>
The reason for using <SAMP>`##'</SAMP> is to handle the case when <CODE>args</CODE>
matches no arguments at all.  In this case, <CODE>args</CODE> has an empty
value.  In this case, the second comma in the definition becomes an
embarrassment: if it got through to the expansion of the macro, we would
get something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
fprintf (stderr, "success!\n" , )
</PRE>
<P>
which is invalid C syntax.  <SAMP>`##'</SAMP> gets rid of the comma, so we get
the following instead:
<P>
<PRE>
fprintf (stderr, "success!\n")
</PRE>
<P>
This is a special feature of the GNU C preprocessor: <SAMP>`##'</SAMP> before a
rest argument that is empty discards the preceding sequence of
non-whitespace characters from the macro definition.  (If another macro
argument precedes, none of it is discarded.)
<P>
It might be better to discard the last preprocessor token instead of the
last preceding sequence of non-whitespace characters; in fact, we may
someday change this feature to do so.  We advise you to write the macro
definition so that the preceding sequence of non-whitespace characters
is just a single token, so that the meaning will not change if we change
the definition of this feature.
<P>
