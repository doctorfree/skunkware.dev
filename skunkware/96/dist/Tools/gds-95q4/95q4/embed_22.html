<H3><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="embed_toc.html#TOC22">What to call the tools</A></H3>
<P>
Cross-development tools in the Cygnus Developer's Kit are normally
installed with names that reflect the target machine, so that you can
install more than one set of tools in the same binary directory.
<P>
The target name, constructed with the <CODE>--target</CODE> option to 
<CODE>configure</CODE>, is used as a prefix to the program name.  
 For example, the compiler (called simply <CODE>gcc</CODE> in native 
configurations) is called by the name for Hitachi SH cross-development:
<P>
<CODE>sh-hms-gcc</CODE>
<P>
Likewise, the Hitachi SH-configured GDB is called by the name:
<P>
<CODE>sh-hms-gdb</CODE>
<P>
For DOS-hosted toolchains, the tools are simply called by their
standard names, e.g., <CODE>gcc</CODE>, <CODE>gdb</CODE>, etc.
