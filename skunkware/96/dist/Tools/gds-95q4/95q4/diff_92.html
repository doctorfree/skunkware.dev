<P>
If you think you have found a bug in GNU <CODE>cmp</CODE>, <CODE>diff</CODE>,
<CODE>diff3</CODE>, <CODE>sdiff</CODE>, or <CODE>patch</CODE>, please report it by
electronic mail to <SAMP>`bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu'</SAMP>.  Send as
precise a description of the problem as you can, including sample input
files that produce the bug, if applicable.
<P>
Because Larry Wall has not released a new version of <CODE>patch</CODE> since
mid 1988 and the GNU version of <CODE>patch</CODE> has been changed since
then, please send bug reports for <CODE>patch</CODE> by electronic mail to
both <SAMP>`bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`lwall@netlabs.com'</SAMP>.
