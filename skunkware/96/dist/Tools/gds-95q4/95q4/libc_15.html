<STRONG>Synopsis</STRONG>
<PRE>
#include &#60;stdlib.h&#62;
void exit(int <VAR>code</VAR>);

</PRE>
<STRONG>Description</STRONG><BR>
Use <CODE>exit</CODE> to return control from a program to the host operating
environment.  Use the argument <VAR>code</VAR> to pass an exit status to the
operating environment: two particular values, <CODE>EXIT_SUCCESS</CODE> and
<CODE>EXIT_FAILURE</CODE>, are defined in `<CODE>stdlib.h</CODE>' to indicate success or
failure in a portable fashion.
<P>
<CODE>exit</CODE> does two kinds of cleanup before ending execution of your
program.  First, it calls all application-defined cleanup functions
you have enrolled with <CODE>atexit</CODE>.  Second, files and streams are
cleaned up: any pending output is delivered to the host system, each
open file or stream is closed, and files created by <CODE>tmpfile</CODE> are
deleted.
<P>
<BR>
<STRONG>Returns</STRONG><BR>
<CODE>exit</CODE> does not return to its caller.
<P>
<BR>
<STRONG>Portability</STRONG><BR>
ANSI C requires <CODE>exit</CODE>, and specifies that <CODE>EXIT_SUCCESS</CODE> and
<CODE>EXIT_FAILURE</CODE> must be defined.
<P>
Supporting OS subroutines required: <CODE>_exit</CODE>.
