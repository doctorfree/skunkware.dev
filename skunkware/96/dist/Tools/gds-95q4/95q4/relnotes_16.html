<H2><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="relnotes_toc.html#TOC16">Options for CPU32 and CPU32+ targets</A></H2>
<P>
The Motorola CPU32 and CPU32+ targets are part of the family
of 68000 chips which Cygnus supports.  There are a few options to help
you compile code for these targets:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
GCC has an option <SAMP>`-m68332'</SAMP> to be used specifically when
compiling for the Motorola 68332 board.  (GCC also has an option
<SAMP>`-m68302'</SAMP>, currently undocumented.  The 68302 technically isn't
a CPU32 chip.)

<LI>
It is also possible to configure GCC for a target of
<SAMP>`m68332-aout'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`m68332-coff'</SAMP> when rebuilding from source, in
which case <SAMP>`-m68332'</SAMP> is the default.

<LI>
GNU AS accepts the following board-specific options:

<PRE>
-mcpu32     -m68331     -m68332
-m68333     -m68340     <EM>(and <CODE>-m68302</CODE>)</EM>

CPU32 and CPU32+ targets.
