<H2><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="usegcc_toc.html#TOC20">Options for Linking</A></H2>
<P>
These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX89"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE><VAR>object-file-name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input
to the linker.

<DT><CODE>-c</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-S</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-E</CODE>
<DD>If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
object file names should not be used as arguments.  See section <A HREF="usegcc_8.html#SEC11">Options Controlling the Kind of Output</A>.

<A NAME="IDX90"></A>
<DT><CODE>-l<VAR>library</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Search the library named <VAR>library</VAR> when linking.

It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, <SAMP>`foo.o -lz bar.o'</SAMP> searches library <SAMP>`z'</SAMP>
after file <TT>`foo.o'</TT> but before <TT>`bar.o'</TT>.  If <TT>`bar.o'</TT> refers
to functions in <SAMP>`z'</SAMP>, those functions may not be loaded.

The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
which is actually a file named <TT>`lib<VAR>library</VAR>.a'</TT>.  The linker
then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.

The directories searched include several standard system directories
plus any that you specify with <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP>.

Normally the files found this way are library files--archive files
whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive file by
scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far
been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an
ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only
difference between using an <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option and specifying a file name
is that <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> surrounds <VAR>library</VAR> with <SAMP>`lib'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`.a'</SAMP>
and searches several directories.

<DT><CODE>-lobjc</CODE>
<DD>You need this special case of the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option in order to
link an Objective C program.

<DT><CODE>-nostartfiles</CODE>
<DD>Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless <CODE>-nostdlib</CODE>
or <CODE>-nodefaultlibs</CODE> is used.

<DT><CODE>-nodefaultlibs</CODE>
<DD>Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.
Only the libraries you specify will be passed to the linker.
The standard startup files are used normally, unless <CODE>-nostartfiles</CODE>
is used.

<DT><CODE>-nostdlib</CODE>
<DD>Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking.
No startup files and only the libraries you specify will be passed to
the linker.

<A NAME="IDX92"></A>
<A NAME="IDX93"></A>
<A NAME="IDX94"></A>
<A NAME="IDX95"></A>
<A NAME="IDX96"></A>
<A NAME="IDX91"></A>
One of the standard libraries bypassed by <SAMP>`-nostdlib'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-nodefaultlibs'</SAMP> is <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT>, a library of internal subroutines
that GNU CC uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special
needs for some languages.
(See section `Interfacing to GNU CC Output' in <CITE>Porting GNU CC</CITE>,
for more discussion of <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT>.)
In most cases, you need <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT> even when you want to avoid
other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify <SAMP>`-nostdlib'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`-nodefaultlibs'</SAMP> you should usually specify <SAMP>`-lgcc'</SAMP> as well.
This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal GNU CC
library subroutines.  (For example, <SAMP>`__main'</SAMP>, used to ensure C++
constructors will be called; see section <A HREF="usegcc_55.html#SEC58"><CODE>collect2</CODE></A>.)

<DT><CODE>-s</CODE>
<DD>Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.

<DT><CODE>-static</CODE>
<DD>On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with the shared
libraries.  On other systems, this option has no effect.

<DT><CODE>-shared</CODE>
<DD>Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to
form an executable.  Only a few systems support this option.

<DT><CODE>-symbolic</CODE>
<DD>Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn
about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor
option <SAMP>`-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs'</SAMP>).  Only a few systems support
this option.

<DT><CODE>-Xlinker <VAR>option</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Pass <VAR>option</VAR> as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options which GNU CC does not know how to
recognize.

If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
<SAMP>`-Xlinker'</SAMP> twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
For example, to pass <SAMP>`-assert definitions'</SAMP>, you must write
<SAMP>`-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions'</SAMP>.  It does not work to write
<SAMP>`-Xlinker "-assert definitions"'</SAMP>, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.

<DT><CODE>-Wl,<VAR>option</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Pass <VAR>option</VAR> as an option to the linker.  If <VAR>option</VAR> contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.

<DT><CODE>-u <VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Pretend the symbol <VAR>symbol</VAR> is undefined, to force linking of
library modules to define it.  You can use <SAMP>`-u'</SAMP> multiple times with
different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.
