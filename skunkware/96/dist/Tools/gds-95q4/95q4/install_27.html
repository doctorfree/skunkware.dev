<P>
The total space required to extract and install binaries for all
programs in the Developer's Kit is from 10 to 16 megabytes, depending on
the target.  The actual disk space required by the Developer's Kit is
printed on the disk label.  The <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> program dynamically
compares the space available on your designated drive with the size of
the installation before starting the installation. If you do not have
enough space to install the binaries, the <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> program exits
with an error message before writing anything.
<P>
Note that if you're using a disk compression utility like <CODE>STACKER</CODE>
then the actual amount of disk space that you have available may be less
than reported.  This is because the compression utilities usually report
the amount of free space available assuming that the data which would go
into it would be compressed at least as well as the data already on the
disk.  This is important information if you're trying to install the
tools onto a compressed disk with only just enough room for the
installation.  It could be that you run out of real disk space before
the installation is complete because the compression utility couldn't do
as good a job as it expected.
