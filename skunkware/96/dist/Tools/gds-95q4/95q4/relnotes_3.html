<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="relnotes_toc.html#TOC3">Confidential information in problem reports</A></H2>
<P>
There has been some confusion about where to put confidential
information in problem reports sent with <CODE>send-pr</CODE>.  If you submit
a problem report to Cygnus, and you want its detailed contents to remain
confidential, set the <SAMP>`&#62;Confidential:'</SAMP> field to <SAMP>`yes'</SAMP>.
<P>
However, the <SAMP>`Subject:'</SAMP> line in the mail header and the
<SAMP>`&#62;Synopsis:'</SAMP> field in the body of the PR are <EM>not</EM> treated as
confidential information, as they are used when we compile reports, such
as the list of Fixed Problems in this manual (see section <A HREF="relnotes_30.html#SEC30">Problems fixed in this release</A>).  <EM>Do not</EM> put confidential
information in these fields.  Any code samples, machine descriptions,
problem details, and so on of course remain strictly confidential in any
problem report marked as such.
<P>
The mail query server for problem reports never reports any information
from confidential bug reports.
