<H3><A NAME="SEC49" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC49">How the <CODE>MAKE</CODE> Variable Works</A></H3>
<P>
Recursive <CODE>make</CODE> commands should always use the variable <CODE>MAKE</CODE>,
not the explicit command name <SAMP>`make'</SAMP>, as shown here:
<P>
<PRE>
subsystem:
        cd subdir; $(MAKE)
</PRE>
<P>
The value of this variable is the file name with which <CODE>make</CODE> was
invoked.  If this file name was <TT>`/bin/make'</TT>, then the command executed
is <SAMP>`cd subdir; /bin/make'</SAMP>.  If you use a special version of
<CODE>make</CODE> to run the top-level makefile, the same special version will be
executed for recursive invocations.
<A NAME="IDX301"></A>
<P>
As a special feature, using the variable <CODE>MAKE</CODE> in the commands of
a rule alters the effects of the <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> (<SAMP>`--touch'</SAMP>), <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP>
(<SAMP>`--just-print'</SAMP>), or <SAMP>`-q'</SAMP> (<SAMP>`--question'</SAMP>) option.
Using the <CODE>MAKE</CODE> variable has the same effect as using a <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>
character at the beginning of the command line.  See section <A HREF="make_82.html#SEC81">Instead of Executing the Commands</A>.<P>
Consider the command <SAMP>`make -t'</SAMP> in the above example.  (The
<SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> option marks targets as up to date without actually running
any commands; see section <A HREF="make_82.html#SEC81">Instead of Executing the Commands</A>.)  Following the usual
definition of <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP>, a <SAMP>`make -t'</SAMP> command in the example would
create a file named <TT>`subsystem'</TT> and do nothing else.  What you
really want it to do is run <SAMP>`cd subdir; make -t'</SAMP>; but that would
require executing the command, and <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> says not to execute
commands.<A NAME="IDX303"></A>
<A NAME="IDX304"></A>
<A NAME="IDX302"></A>
<P>
The special feature makes this do what you want: whenever a command
line of a rule contains the variable <CODE>MAKE</CODE>, the flags <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-n'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-q'</SAMP> do not apply to that line.  Command lines
containing <CODE>MAKE</CODE> are executed normally despite the presence of a
flag that causes most commands not to be run.  The usual
<CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> mechanism passes the flags to the sub-<CODE>make</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="make_52.html#SEC51">Communicating Options to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>), so your request to touch the files, or print the
commands, is propagated to the subsystem.<P>
