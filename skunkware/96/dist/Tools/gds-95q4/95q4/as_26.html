<P>
There are two ways of rendering comments to <CODE>as</CODE>.  In both
cases the comment is equivalent to one space.
<P>
Anything from <SAMP>`/*'</SAMP> through the next <SAMP>`*/'</SAMP> is a comment.
This means you may not nest these comments.
<P>
<PRE>
/*
  The only way to include a newline ('\n') in a comment
  is to use this sort of comment.
*/

/* This sort of comment does not nest. */
</PRE>
<A NAME="IDX92"></A>
<P>
Anything from the <DFN>line comment</DFN> character to the next newline
is considered a comment and is ignored.  The line comment character is
<SAMP>`#'</SAMP> on the Vax;
<SAMP>`#'</SAMP> on the i960;
<SAMP>`!'</SAMP> on the SPARC;
<SAMP>`|'</SAMP> on the 680x0;
<SAMP>`;'</SAMP> for the AMD 29K family;
<SAMP>`;'</SAMP> for the H8/300 family;
<SAMP>`!'</SAMP> for the H8/500 family;
<SAMP>`;'</SAMP> for the HPPA;
<SAMP>`!'</SAMP> for the Hitachi SH;
<SAMP>`!'</SAMP> for the Z8000;
see section <A HREF="as_126.html#SEC128">Machine Dependent Features</A>.  <P>
On some machines there are two different line comment characters.  One
character only begins a comment if it is the first non-whitespace character on
a line, while the other always begins a comment.
<A NAME="IDX93"></A>
<A NAME="IDX94"></A>
<A NAME="IDX95"></A>
<P>
To be compatible with past assemblers, lines that begin with <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> have a
special interpretation.  Following the <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> should be an absolute
expression (see section <A HREF="as_56.html#SEC58">Expressions</A>): the logical line number of the <EM>next</EM>
line.  Then a string (see section <A HREF="as_31.html#SEC31">Strings</A>) is allowed: if present it is a
new logical file name.  The rest of the line, if any, should be whitespace.
<P>
If the first non-whitespace characters on the line are not numeric,
the line is ignored.  (Just like a comment.)
<P>
<PRE>
                          # This is an ordinary comment.
# 42-6 "new_file_name"    # New logical file name
                          # This is logical line # 36.
</PRE>
This feature is deprecated, and may disappear from future versions
of <CODE>as</CODE>.
