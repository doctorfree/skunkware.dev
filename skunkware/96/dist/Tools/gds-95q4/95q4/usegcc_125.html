<P>
It is dangerous to use pointers or references to <EM>portions</EM> of a
temporary object.  The compiler may very well delete the object before
you expect it to, leaving a pointer to garbage.  The most common place
where this problem crops up is in classes like the libg++
<CODE>String</CODE> class, that define a conversion function to type
<CODE>char *</CODE> or <CODE>const char *</CODE>.  However, any class that returns
a pointer to some internal structure is potentially subject to this
problem.
<P>
For example, a program may use a function <CODE>strfunc</CODE> that returns
<CODE>String</CODE> objects, and another function <CODE>charfunc</CODE> that
operates on pointers to <CODE>char</CODE>:
<P>
<PRE>
String strfunc ();
void charfunc (const char *);
</PRE>
<P>
In this situation, it may seem natural to write <SAMP>`charfunc
(strfunc ());'</SAMP> based on the knowledge that class <CODE>String</CODE> has an
explicit conversion to <CODE>char</CODE> pointers.  However, what really
happens is akin to <SAMP>`charfunc (strfunc ().convert ());'</SAMP>,
where the <CODE>convert</CODE> method is a function to do the same data
conversion normally performed by a cast.  Since the last use of the
temporary <CODE>String</CODE> object is the call to the conversion function,
the compiler may delete that object before actually calling
<CODE>charfunc</CODE>.  The compiler has no way of knowing that deleting the
<CODE>String</CODE> object will invalidate the pointer.  The pointer then
points to garbage, so that by the time <CODE>charfunc</CODE> is called, it
gets an invalid argument.
<P>
Code like this may run successfully under some other compilers,
especially those that delete temporaries relatively late.  However, the
GNU C++ behavior is also standard-conformant, so if your program depends
on late destruction of temporaries it is not portable.
<P>
If you think this is surprising, you should be aware that the ANSI C++
committee continues to debate the lifetime-of-temporaries problem.
<P>
For now, at least, the safe way to write such code is to give the
temporary a name, which forces it to remain until the end of the scope of
the name.  For example:
<P>
<PRE>
String&#38; tmp = strfunc ();
charfunc (tmp);
</PRE>
