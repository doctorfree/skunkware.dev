<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="send-pr_toc.html#TOC7">Creating new Problem Reports</A></H2>
<P>
Invoking <CODE>send-pr</CODE> presents a PR <DFN>template</DFN> with a number of
fields already filled in.  Complete the template as thoroughly as
possible to make a useful bug report.  Submit only one bug with each PR.
<A NAME="IDX111"></A>
<P>
A template consists of three sections:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DFN>Comments</DFN>
<DD>The top several lines of a blank template consist of a series of
comments that provide some basic instructions for completing the Problem
Report, as well as a list of valid entries for the <SAMP>`&#62;Category:'</SAMP>
field.  These comments are all preceded by the string <SAMP>`SEND-PR:'</SAMP>
and are erased automatically when the PR is submitted.  The
instructional comments within <SAMP>`&#60;'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP> are also removed.
(Only these comments are removed; lines you provide that happen to have
those characters in them, such as examples of shell-level redirection,
are not affected.)

<DT><DFN>Mail Header</DFN>
<DD><CODE>send-pr</CODE> creates a standard mail header.  <CODE>send-pr</CODE> completes
all fields except the <SAMP>`Subject:'</SAMP> line with default values.
(See section <A HREF="send-pr_4.html#SEC3">Problem Report format</A>.)

<DT><DFN>PRMS fields</DFN>
<DD>These are the informational fields that PRMS uses to route your
Problem Report to the responsible party for further action.  They should
be filled out as completely as possible.  (See section <A HREF="send-pr_4.html#SEC3">Problem Report format</A>.  Also see section <A HREF="send-pr_11.html#SEC10">Helpful hints</A>.)
</DL>
<P>
For examples of a Problem Report template and complete Problem Report,
see section <A HREF="send-pr_12.html#SEC11">An Example</A>.
<P>
The default template contains your preconfigured <SAMP>`&#62;Submitter-Id:'</SAMP>.
<CODE>send-pr</CODE> attempts to determine values for the <SAMP>`&#62;Originator:'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`&#62;Organization:'</SAMP> fields (see section <A HREF="send-pr_4.html#SEC3">Problem Report format</A>).  <CODE>send-pr</CODE> also attempts to find out some information
about your system and architecture, and places this information in the
<SAMP>`&#62;Environment:'</SAMP> field if it finds any.
<P>
You may submit problem reports to different Support Sites from the
default site by specifying the alternate site when you invoke
<CODE>send-pr</CODE>.  Each <CODE>site</CODE> has its own list of categories for
which it accepts Problem Reports.
(See section <A HREF="send-pr_16.html#SEC15">Setting a default <VAR>site</VAR></A>.)
<P>
<CODE>send-pr</CODE> also provides the mail header section of the template
with default values in the <SAMP>`To:'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`From:'</SAMP>, and
<SAMP>`Reply-To:'</SAMP> fields.  The <SAMP>`Subject:'</SAMP> field is empty.
<P>
The template begins with a comment section:
<A NAME="IDX112"></A>
<A NAME="IDX113"></A>
<P>
<PRE>
SEND-PR: -*- send-pr  -*-
SEND-PR: Lines starting with `SEND-PR' will be removed
SEND-PR: automatically as well as all comments (the text 
SEND-PR: below enclosed in `&#60;' and `&#62;').
SEND-PR: 
SEND-PR: Please consult the document `Reporting Problems 
SEND-PR: Using send-pr' if you are not sure how to fill out
SEND-PR: a problem report.
SEND-PR:
SEND-PR: Choose from the following categories:
</PRE>
<P>
and also contains a list of valid <CODE>&#62;Category:</CODE> values for the
Support Site to whom you are submitting this Problem Report.  One (and
only one) of these values should be placed in the <CODE>&#62;Category:</CODE>
field.
A complete sample bug report, from template to completed PR, is shown in
section <A HREF="send-pr_12.html#SEC11">An Example</A>.  For a complete list of valid categories, type
<SAMP>`send-pr -L'</SAMP> at your prompt.  See section <A HREF="send-pr_13.html#SEC12">Valid Categories</A>, for a sample list of categories, .
<P>
The mail header is just below the comment section.  Fill out the
<SAMP>`Subject:'</SAMP> field, if it is not already completed using the value of
<SAMP>`&#62;Synopsis:'</SAMP>.  The other mail header fields contain default values.
<A NAME="IDX114"></A>
<P>
<PRE>
To: <VAR>support-site</VAR>
Subject: <EM>complete this field</EM>
From: <VAR>your-login</VAR>@<VAR>your-site</VAR>
Reply-To: <VAR>your-login</VAR>@<VAR>your-site</VAR>
X-send-pr-version: send-pr 3.95-95q4
</PRE>
<P>
where <VAR>support-site</VAR> is an alias for the Support Site you wish to
submit this PR to.
<P>
The rest of the template contains PRMS fields.  Each field is
either automatically completed with valid information (such as your
<SAMP>`&#62;Submitter-Id:'</SAMP>) or contains a one-line instruction specifying the
information that field requires in order to be correct.  For example,
the <SAMP>`&#62;Confidential:'</SAMP> field expects a value of <SAMP>`yes'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`no'</SAMP>, and the answer must fit on one line; similarly, the
<SAMP>`&#62;Synopsis:'</SAMP> field expects a short synopsis of the problem, which
must also fit on one line.  Fill out the fields as completely as
possible.  See section <A HREF="send-pr_11.html#SEC10">Helpful hints</A>, for suggestions as to
what kinds of information to include.
<P>
In this example, words in <EM>italics</EM> are filled in with
pre-configured information:
<A NAME="IDX115"></A>
<P>
<PRE>
&#62;Submitter-Id: <EM>your submitter-id</EM>
&#62;Originator:   <EM>your name here</EM>
&#62;Organization:  
    <EM>your organization</EM>
&#62;Confidential:&#60;[ yes | no ] (one line)&#62;
&#62;Synopsis:    &#60;synopsis of the problem (one line)&#62;
&#62;Severity:    &#60;[non-critical | serious | critical](one line)&#62;
&#62;Priority:    &#60;[ low | medium | high ] (one line)&#62;
&#62;Category:    &#60;name of the product (one line)&#62;
&#62;Class:       &#60;[sw-bug | doc-bug | change-request | support]&#62;
&#62;Release:     &#60;release number or tag (one line)&#62;
&#62;Environment:
         &#60;machine, os, target, libraries (multiple lines)&#62;

&#62;Description:
       &#60;precise description of the problem (multiple lines)&#62;
&#62;How-To-Repeat:
       &#60;code/input/activities to reproduce (multiple lines)&#62;
&#62;Fix:
       &#60;how to correct or work around the problem, if known 
        (multiple lines)&#62;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX117"></A>
<P>
When you finish editing the Problem Report, <CODE>send-pr</CODE> mails it to
the address named in the <SAMP>`To:'</SAMP> field in the mail header.
<CODE>send-pr</CODE> checks that the complete form contains a valid
<SAMP>`&#62;Category:'</SAMP>.
<P>
Your copy of <CODE>send-pr</CODE> should have already been customized on
installation to reflect your <SAMP>`&#62;Submitter-Id:'</SAMP>.  (See section <A HREF="send-pr_14.html#SEC13">Installing <CODE>send-pr</CODE> on your system</A>.)  If you don't
know your <SAMP>`&#62;Submitter-Id:'</SAMP>, you can request it using
<SAMP>`send-pr --request-id'</SAMP>.  If your organization is not affiliated
with the site you send Problem Reports to, a good generic
<SAMP>`&#62;Submitter-Id:'</SAMP> to use is <SAMP>`net'</SAMP>.
<A NAME="IDX118"></A>
<A NAME="IDX119"></A>
<A NAME="IDX120"></A>
<P>
If your PR has an invalid value in one of the ENUMERATED fields
(see section <A HREF="send-pr_4.html#SEC3">Problem Report format</A>), <CODE>send-pr</CODE> places the PR in
a temporary file named <SAMP>`/tmp/pbad<VAR>nnnn</VAR>'</SAMP> on your machine.
<VAR>nnnn</VAR> is the process identification number given to your current
<CODE>send-pr</CODE> session.  If you are running <CODE>send-pr</CODE> from the
shell, you are prompted as to whether or not you wish to try editing the
same Problem Report again.  If you are running <CODE>send-pr</CODE> from
Emacs, the Problem Report is placed in the buffer
<SAMP>`*send-pr-error*'</SAMP>; you can edit this file and then submit it
with
<P>

<P>
Any further mail concerning this Problem Report should be carbon-copied
to the PRMS mailing address as well, with the category and
identification number in the <SAMP>`Subject:'</SAMP> line of the message.
<P>
<PRE>
Subject: Re: PR <VAR>category</VAR>/<VAR>prms-id</VAR>: <VAR>original message subject</VAR>

<P>
Messages which arrive with <SAMP>`Subject:'</SAMP> lines of this form are
automatically appended to the Problem Report in the <SAMP>`&#62;Audit-Trail:'</SAMP>
field in the order received.
