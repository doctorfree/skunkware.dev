<P>
While GAS normally writes only "pure" 32-bit i386 code, it has limited
support for writing code to run in real mode or in 16-bit protected mode
code segments.  To do this, insert a <SAMP>`.code16'</SAMP> directive before the
assembly language instructions to be run in 16-bit mode.  You can switch
GAS back to writing normal 32-bit code with the <SAMP>`.code32'</SAMP> directive.
<P>
GAS understands exactly the same assembly language syntax in 16-bit mode as
in 32-bit mode.  The function of any given instruction is exactly the same
regardless of mode, as long as the resulting object code is executed in the
mode for which GAS wrote it.  So, for example, the <SAMP>`ret'</SAMP> mnemonic
produces a 32-bit return instruction regardless of whether it is to be run
in 16-bit or 32-bit mode.  (If GAS is in 16-bit mode, it will add an
operand size prefix to the instruction to force it to be a 32-bit return.)
<P>
This means, for one thing, that you can use GNU CC to write code to be run
in real mode or 16-bit protected mode.  Just insert the statement
<SAMP>`asm(".code16");'</SAMP> at the beginning of your C source file, and while
GNU CC will still be generating 32-bit code, GAS will automatically add 
all the necessary size prefixes to make that code run in 16-bit mode.  Of
course, since GNU CC only writes small-model code (it doesn't know how to
attach segment selectors to pointers like native x86 compilers do), any
16-bit code you write with GNU CC will essentially be limited to a 64K
address space.  Also, there will be a code size and performance penalty
due to all the extra address and operand size prefixes GAS has to add to
the instructions.
<P>
Note that placing GAS in 16-bit mode does not mean that the resulting
code will necessarily run on a 16-bit pre-80386 processor.  To write code
that runs on such a processor, you would have to refrain from using
<EM>any</EM> 32-bit constructs which require GAS to output address or
operand size prefixes.  At the moment this would be rather difficult,
because GAS currently supports <EM>only</EM> 32-bit addressing modes: when
writing 16-bit code, it <EM>always</EM> outputs address size prefixes for any
instruction that uses a non-register addressing mode.  So you can write
code that runs on 16-bit processors, but only if that code never references
memory.
