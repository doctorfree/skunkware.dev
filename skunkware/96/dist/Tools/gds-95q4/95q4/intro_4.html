<P>
GNU development tools provide a powerful, integrated applications
development environment. Cygnus Support is one of the primary develpment
centers for GNU tools; your support contract links you directly
with the developers.  With this release, Cygnus Support has provided the
latest fully-tested release of the GNU tools, preconfigured for
your supported system.
<P>
<H3>Updates to your progressive release</H3>
 
Every quarter
during the period of your support contract, Cygnus Support
provides an updated toolchain, complete with the latest enhancements and
improvements.  The updates also include bug fixes and updated
documentation. Most customers receive these updates automatically; if
you wish to get automatic updating, please call our support hotline at
+1 415 903 1401.
<P>
You also receive a monthly newsletter, <CITE>Inside Cygnus Engineering,</CITE>
which keeps you informed about release dates, improvements, new
supported platforms, and new products.  We often request information
about your needs via surveys in this newsletter.

<H3>Future Needs</H3>
 
The availability of source code enables anyone to enhance the GNU
tools.  While Cygnus is doing the greatest amount of ongoing
development, many other users around the world are also contributing
enhancements and improvments.  Cygnus integration and regression testing
ensures that enhancements made elsewhere can work with Cygnus'
developments.  As your needs evolve, so do the capabilities of the
GNU tools and the support services available from Cygnus Support.
