<P>
Cross references have two major parts: the first part is called the
<DFN>label</DFN>; it is the name that you can use to refer to the cross
reference, and the second is the <DFN>target</DFN>; it is the full name of
the node that the cross reference points to.
<P>
The target is separated from the label by a colon <SAMP>`:'</SAMP>; first the
label appears, and then the target.  For example, in the sample menu
cross reference below, the single colon separates the label from the
target.
<P>
<PRE>
* Foo Label: Foo Target.	More information about Foo.
</PRE>
<P>
Note the <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> which ends the name of the target.  The <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> is
not part of the target; it serves only to let Info know where the target
name ends.
<P>
A shorthand way of specifying references allows two adjacent colons to
stand for a target name which is the same as the label name:
<P>
<PRE>
* Foo Commands::		Commands pertaining to Foo.
</PRE>
<P>
In the above example, the name of the target is the same as the name of
the label, in this case <CODE>Foo Commands</CODE>.
<P>
You will normally see two types of cross references while viewing nodes:
<DFN>menu</DFN> references, and <DFN>note</DFN> references.  Menu references
appear within a node's menu; they begin with a <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> at the beginning
of a line, and continue with a label, a target, and a comment which
describes what the contents of the node pointed to contains.
<P>
Note references appear within the body of the node text; they begin with
<CODE>*Note</CODE>, and continue with a label and a target.
<P>
Like <SAMP>`Next'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`Prev'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`Up'</SAMP> pointers, cross references
can point to any valid node.  They are used to refer you to a place
where more detailed information can be found on a particular subject.
Here is a cross reference which points to a node within the Texinfo
documentation:  See section `Writing an Xref' in <CITE>the Texinfo Manual</CITE>, for more information on creating your own texinfo cross
references.
