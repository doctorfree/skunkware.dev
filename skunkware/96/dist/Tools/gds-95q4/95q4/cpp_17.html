<P>
To <DFN>undefine</DFN> a macro means to cancel its definition.  This is done
with the <SAMP>`#undef'</SAMP> directive.  <SAMP>`#undef'</SAMP> is followed by the macro
name to be undefined.
<P>
Like definition, undefinition occurs at a specific point in the source
file, and it applies starting from that point.  The name ceases to be a
macro name, and from that point on it is treated by the preprocessor as if
it had never been a macro name.
<P>
For example,
<P>
<PRE>
#define FOO 4
x = FOO;
#undef FOO
x = FOO;
</PRE>
<P>
expands into
<P>
<PRE>
x = 4;

x = FOO;
</PRE>
<P>
In this example, <SAMP>`FOO'</SAMP> had better be a variable or function as well
as (temporarily) a macro, in order for the result of the expansion to be
valid C code.
<P>
The same form of <SAMP>`#undef'</SAMP> directive will cancel definitions with
arguments or definitions that don't expect arguments.  The <SAMP>`#undef'</SAMP>
directive has no effect when used on a name not currently defined as a macro.
