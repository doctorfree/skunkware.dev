<P>
When an input file ends in a non-newline character, its last line is
called an <DFN>incomplete line</DFN> because its last character is not a
newline.  All other lines are called <DFN>full lines</DFN> and end in a
newline character.  Incomplete lines do not match full lines unless
differences in white space are ignored (see section <A HREF="diff_4.html#SEC4">Suppressing Differences in Blank and Tab Spacing</A>).
<P>
An incomplete line is normally distinguished on output from a full line
by a following line that starts with <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>.  However, the RCS format
(see section <A HREF="diff_35.html#SEC35">RCS Scripts</A>) outputs the incomplete line as-is, without any trailing
newline or following line.  The side by side format normally represents
incomplete lines as-is, but in some cases uses a <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`/'</SAMP>
gutter marker; See section <A HREF="diff_27.html#SEC27">Showing Differences Side by Side</A>.  The if-then-else line format
preserves a line's incompleteness with <SAMP>`%L'</SAMP>, and discards the
newline with <SAMP>`%l'</SAMP>; See section <A HREF="diff_38.html#SEC38">Line Formats</A>.  Finally, with the
<CODE>ed</CODE> and forward <CODE>ed</CODE> output formats (see section <A HREF="diff_10.html#SEC10"><CODE>diff</CODE> Output Formats</A>)
<CODE>diff</CODE> cannot represent an incomplete line, so it pretends there
was a newline and reports an error.
<P>
For example, suppose <TT>`F'</TT> and <TT>`G'</TT> are one-byte files that
contain just <SAMP>`f'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`g'</SAMP>, respectively.  Then <SAMP>`diff F G'</SAMP>
outputs
<P>
<PRE>
1c1
&#60; f
\ No newline at end of file
---
&#62; g
\ No newline at end of file
</PRE>
<P>
(The exact message may differ in non-English locales.)
<SAMP>`diff -n F G'</SAMP> outputs the following without a trailing newline:
<P>
<PRE>
d1 1
a1 1
g
</PRE>
<P>
<SAMP>`diff -e F G'</SAMP> reports two errors and outputs the following:
<P>
<PRE>
1c
g
.
