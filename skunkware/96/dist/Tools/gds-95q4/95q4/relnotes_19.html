<H2><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="relnotes_toc.html#TOC19">Accessing the <SAMP>`m68k-idp'</SAMP> targets</A></H2>
<P>
The way GDB accesses programs intended for the IDP board has
changed.  With this release, as with the previous one, you should
compile programs for this board using <SAMP>`-Tidp.ld'</SAMP> and the
<SAMP>`-nostartfiles'</SAMP> option (this option is not necessary for COFF
configurations):
<P>
<PRE>
m68k-coff-gcc ... -Tidp.ld ...
   <EM>or</EM>
m68k-aout-gcc ... -Tidp.ld -nostartfiles ...
</PRE>
<P>
This yields a binary file which you can you convert to an S-record using
<CODE>objcopy</CODE>, and then run directly on the IDP board
(see section `<CODE>objcopy</CODE>' in <CITE>The GNU Binary Utilities</CITE>).
<P>
We used to provide pieces of a ROM68K tool chain which were needed
to allow GDB to communicate with an IDP board over a serial
line.  Motorola now supplies a boot monitor called ROM68K with
which GDB can communicate.  To debug a program compiled in the
manner described above, type the following on the GDB command line:
<P>
<PRE>
target rom68k <VAR>device</VAR> 9600
</PRE>
<P>
where <VAR>device</VAR> corresponds to the device you used to download the
binary into the board (for example, <SAMP>`/dev/ttya'</SAMP>).
