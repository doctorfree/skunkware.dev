<TITLE>Using GNU CC - Collect2</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
Go to the <A HREF="usegcc_1.html">first</A>, <A HREF="usegcc_54.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="usegcc_56.html">next</A>, <A HREF="usegcc_139.html">last</A> section, <A HREF="usegcc_toc.html">table of contents</A>.

<H2><A NAME="SEC58" HREF="usegcc_toc.html#TOC58"><CODE>collect2</CODE></A></H2>
<P>
Many target systems do not have support in the assembler and linker for
"constructors"---initialization functions to be called before the
official "start" of <CODE>main</CODE>.  On such systems, GNU CC uses a
utility called <CODE>collect2</CODE> to arrange to call these functions at
start time.
<P>
The program <CODE>collect2</CODE> works by linking the program once and
looking through the linker output file for symbols with particular names
indicating they are constructor functions.  If it finds any, it
creates a new temporary <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> file containing a table of them,
compiles it, and links the program a second time including that file.
<A NAME="IDX240"></A>
<A NAME="IDX241"></A>
<P>
The actual calls to the constructors are carried out by a subroutine
called <CODE>__main</CODE>, which is called (automatically) at the beginning
of the body of <CODE>main</CODE> (provided <CODE>main</CODE> was compiled with GNU
CC).  Calling <CODE>__main</CODE> is necessary, even when compiling C code, to
allow linking C and C++ object code together.  (If you use
<SAMP>`-nostdlib'</SAMP>, you get an unresolved reference to <CODE>__main</CODE>,
since it's defined in the standard <CODE>gcc</CODE> library.  Include 
<SAMP>`-lgcc'</SAMP> at the end of your compiler command line to resolve this 
reference.)
<P>
The program <CODE>collect2</CODE> is installed as <CODE>ld</CODE> in the directory
where the passes of the compiler are installed.  When <CODE>collect2</CODE>
needs to find the <EM>real</EM> <CODE>ld</CODE>, it tries the following file
names:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<TT>`real-ld'</TT> in the directories listed in the compiler's search
directories.

<LI>
<TT>`real-ld'</TT> in the directories listed in the environment variable
<CODE>PATH</CODE>.

<LI>
The file specified in the <CODE>REAL_LD_FILE_NAME</CODE> configuration macro,
if specified.

<LI>
<TT>`ld'</TT> in the compiler's search directories, except that
<CODE>collect2</CODE> will not execute itself recursively.

<LI>
<TT>`ld'</TT> in <CODE>PATH</CODE>.
</UL>
<P>
"The compiler's search directories" means all the directories where
<CODE>gcc</CODE> searches for passes of the compiler.  This includes
directories that you specify with <SAMP>`-B'</SAMP>.
<P>
Cross-compilers search a little differently:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<TT>`real-ld'</TT> in the compiler's search directories.

<LI>
<TT>`<VAR>target</VAR>-real-ld'</TT> in <CODE>PATH</CODE>.

<LI>
The file specified in the <CODE>REAL_LD_FILE_NAME</CODE> configuration macro,
if specified.

<LI>
<TT>`ld'</TT> in the compiler's search directories.

<LI>
<TT>`<VAR>target</VAR>-ld'</TT> in <CODE>PATH</CODE>.
</UL>
<P>
<CODE>collect2</CODE> explicitly avoids running <CODE>ld</CODE> using the file name
under which <CODE>collect2</CODE> itself was invoked.  In fact, it remembers
up a list of such names--in case one copy of <CODE>collect2</CODE> finds
another copy (or version) of <CODE>collect2</CODE> installed as <CODE>ld</CODE> in a
second place in the search path.
<P>
<CODE>collect2</CODE> searches for the utilities <CODE>nm</CODE> and <CODE>strip</CODE>
using the same algorithm as above for <CODE>ld</CODE>.
