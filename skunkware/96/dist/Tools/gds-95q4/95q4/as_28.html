<P>
A <DFN>statement</DFN> ends at a newline character (<SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>) or an "at"
sign (<SAMP>`@'</SAMP>).  The newline or at sign is considered part of the
preceding statement.  Newlines and at signs within character constants
are an exception: they do not end statements.
A <DFN>statement</DFN> ends at a newline character (<SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>) or an exclamation 
point (<SAMP>`!'</SAMP>).  The newline or exclamation point is considered part of the
preceding statement.  Newlines and exclamation points within character
constants are an exception: they do not end statements.
A <DFN>statement</DFN> ends at a newline character (<SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>); or (for the
H8/300) a dollar sign (<SAMP>`$'</SAMP>); or (for the
Hitachi-SH or the
H8/500) a semicolon
(<SAMP>`;'</SAMP>).  The newline or separator character is considered part of
the preceding statement.  Newlines and separators within character
constants are an exception: they do not end statements.
A <DFN>statement</DFN> ends at a newline character (<SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>) or line
separator character.  (The line separator is usually <SAMP>`;'</SAMP>, unless
this conflicts with the comment character; see section <A HREF="as_126.html#SEC128">Machine Dependent Features</A>.)  The
newline or separator character is considered part of the preceding
statement.  Newlines and separators within character constants are an
exception: they do not end statements.

<P>
It is an error to end any statement with end-of-file:  the last
character of any input file should be a newline.<A NAME="IDX103"></A>
<A NAME="IDX104"></A>
<A NAME="IDX105"></A>
<P>
You may write a statement on more than one line if you put a
backslash (<KBD>\</KBD>) immediately in front of any newlines within the
statement.  When <CODE>as</CODE> reads a backslashed newline both
characters are ignored.  You can even put backslashed newlines in
the middle of symbol names without changing the meaning of your
source program.
<P>
An empty statement is allowed, and may include whitespace.  It is ignored.
<A NAME="IDX106"></A>
<A NAME="IDX107"></A>
<P>
A statement begins with zero or more labels, optionally followed by a
key symbol which determines what kind of statement it is.  The key
symbol determines the syntax of the rest of the statement.  If the
symbol begins with a dot <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> then the statement is an assembler
directive: typically valid for any computer.  If the symbol begins with
a letter the statement is an assembly language <DFN>instruction</DFN>: it
assembles into a machine language instruction.
Different versions of <CODE>as</CODE> for different computers
recognize different instructions.  In fact, the same symbol may
represent a different instruction in a different computer's assembly
language.<A NAME="IDX108"></A>
<A NAME="IDX109"></A>
<P>
A label is a symbol immediately followed by a colon (<CODE>:</CODE>).
Whitespace before a label or after a colon is permitted, but you may not
have whitespace between a label's symbol and its colon. See section <A HREF="as_44.html#SEC44">Labels</A>.
<P>
For HPPA targets, labels need not be immediately followed by a colon, but 
the definition of a label must begin in column zero.  This also implies that
only one label may be defined on each line.

label:     .directive    followed by something
another_label:           # This is an empty statement.
