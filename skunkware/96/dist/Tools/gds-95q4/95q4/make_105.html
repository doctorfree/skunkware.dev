<P>
An archive file that is used as a library usually contains a special member
named <TT>`__.SYMDEF'</TT> that contains a directory of the external symbol
names defined by all the other members.  After you update any other
members, you need to update <TT>`__.SYMDEF'</TT> so that it will summarize the
other members properly.  This is done by running the <CODE>ranlib</CODE> program:
<P>
<PRE>
ranlib <VAR>archivefile</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
Normally you would put this command in the rule for the archive file,
and make all the members of the archive file dependencies of that rule.
For example,
<P>
<PRE>
libfoo.a: libfoo.a(x.o) libfoo.a(y.o) ...
        ranlib libfoo.a
</PRE>
<P>
The effect of this is to update archive members <TT>`x.o'</TT>, <TT>`y.o'</TT>,
etc., and then update the symbol directory member <TT>`__.SYMDEF'</TT> by
running <CODE>ranlib</CODE>.  The rules for updating the members are not shown
here; most likely you can omit them and use the implicit rule which copies
files into the archive, as described in the preceding section.
<P>
This is not necessary when using the GNU <CODE>ar</CODE> program, which
updates the <TT>`__.SYMDEF'</TT> member automatically.
