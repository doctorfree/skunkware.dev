<P>
Opcode names are suffixed with one character modifiers which specify the
size of operands.  The letters <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`w'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`l'</SAMP> specify
byte, word, and long operands.  If no suffix is specified by an
instruction and it contains no memory operands then <CODE>as</CODE> tries to
fill in the missing suffix based on the destination register operand
(the last one by convention).  Thus, <SAMP>`mov %ax, %bx'</SAMP> is equivalent
to <SAMP>`movw %ax, %bx'</SAMP>; also, <SAMP>`mov $1, %bx'</SAMP> is equivalent to
<SAMP>`movw $1, %bx'</SAMP>.  Note that this is incompatible with the AT&#38;T Unix
assembler which assumes that a missing opcode suffix implies long
operand size.  (This incompatibility does not affect compiler output
since compilers always explicitly specify the opcode suffix.)
<P>
Almost all opcodes have the same names in AT&#38;T and Intel format.  There
are a few exceptions.  The sign extend and zero extend instructions need
two sizes to specify them.  They need a size to sign/zero extend
<EM>from</EM> and a size to zero extend <EM>to</EM>.  This is accomplished
by using two opcode suffixes in AT&#38;T syntax.  Base names for sign extend
and zero extend are <SAMP>`movs...'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`movz...'</SAMP> in AT&#38;T
syntax (<SAMP>`movsx'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`movzx'</SAMP> in Intel syntax).  The opcode
suffixes are tacked on to this base name, the <EM>from</EM> suffix before
the <EM>to</EM> suffix.  Thus, <SAMP>`movsbl %al, %edx'</SAMP> is AT&#38;T syntax for
"move sign extend <EM>from</EM> %al <EM>to</EM> %edx."  Possible suffixes,
thus, are <SAMP>`bl'</SAMP> (from byte to long), <SAMP>`bw'</SAMP> (from byte to word),
and <SAMP>`wl'</SAMP> (from word to long).

The Intel-syntax conversion instructions
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<SAMP>`cbw'</SAMP> -- sign-extend byte in <SAMP>`%al'</SAMP> to word in <SAMP>`%ax'</SAMP>,

<LI>
<SAMP>`cwde'</SAMP> -- sign-extend word in <SAMP>`%ax'</SAMP> to long in <SAMP>`%eax'</SAMP>,

<LI>
<SAMP>`cwd'</SAMP> -- sign-extend word in <SAMP>`%ax'</SAMP> to long in <SAMP>`%dx:%ax'</SAMP>,

<LI>
<SAMP>`cdq'</SAMP> -- sign-extend dword in <SAMP>`%eax'</SAMP> to quad in <SAMP>`%edx:%eax'</SAMP>,
</UL>
<P>
are called <SAMP>`cbtw'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`cwtl'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`cwtd'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`cltd'</SAMP> in
AT&#38;T naming.  <CODE>as</CODE> accepts either naming for these instructions.
<A NAME="IDX663"></A>
<A NAME="IDX664"></A>
<P>
Far call/jump instructions are <SAMP>`lcall'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`ljmp'</SAMP> in
AT&#38;T syntax, but are <SAMP>`call far'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`jump far'</SAMP> in Intel
convention.
