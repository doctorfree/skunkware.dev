<P>
GNU <CODE>make</CODE> knows how to execute several commands at once.
Normally, <CODE>make</CODE> will execute only one command at a time, waiting
for it to finish before executing the next.  However, the <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--jobs'</SAMP> option tells <CODE>make</CODE> to execute many commands
simultaneously.<P>
If the <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option is followed by an integer, this is the number of
commands to execute at once; this is called the number of <DFN>job slots</DFN>.
If there is nothing looking like an integer after the <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option,
there is no limit on the number of job slots.  The default number of job
slots is one, which means serial execution (one thing at a time).
<P>
One unpleasant consequence of running several commands simultaneously is
that output from all of the commands comes when the commands send it, so
messages from different commands may be interspersed.
<P>
Another problem is that two processes cannot both take input from the
same device; so to make sure that only one command tries to take input
from the terminal at once, <CODE>make</CODE> will invalidate the standard
input streams of all but one running command.  This means that
attempting to read from standard input will usually be a fatal error (a
<SAMP>`Broken pipe'</SAMP> signal) for most child processes if there are
several.
<A NAME="IDX266"></A>
<A NAME="IDX265"></A>
<P>
It is unpredictable which command will have a valid standard input stream
(which will come from the terminal, or wherever you redirect the standard
input of <CODE>make</CODE>).  The first command run will always get it first, and
the first command started after that one finishes will get it next, and so
on.
<P>
We will change how this aspect of <CODE>make</CODE> works if we find a better
alternative.  In the mean time, you should not rely on any command using
standard input at all if you are using the parallel execution feature; but
if you are not using this feature, then standard input works normally in
all commands.
<P>
If a command fails (is killed by a signal or exits with a nonzero
status), and errors are not ignored for that command
(see section <A HREF="make_47.html#SEC46">Errors in Commands</A>),
the remaining command lines to remake the same target will not be run.
If a command fails and the <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--keep-going'</SAMP>
option was not given
(see section <A HREF="make_86.html#SEC85">Summary of Options</A>), 
<CODE>make</CODE> aborts execution.  If make
terminates for any reason (including a signal) with child processes
running, it waits for them to finish before actually exiting.<A NAME="IDX267"></A>

<P>
When the system is heavily loaded, you will probably want to run fewer jobs
than when it is lightly loaded.  You can use the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option to tell
<CODE>make</CODE> to limit the number of jobs to run at once, based on the load
average.  The <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--max-load'</SAMP>
option is followed by a floating-point number.  For
example,
<P>
<PRE>
-l 2.5
</PRE>
<P>
will not let <CODE>make</CODE> start more than one job if the load average is
above 2.5.  The <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option with no following number removes the
load limit, if one was given with a previous <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option.<P>
More precisely, when <CODE>make</CODE> goes to start up a job, and it already has
at least one job running, it checks the current load average; if it is not
lower than the limit given with <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>, <CODE>make</CODE> waits until the load
average goes below that limit, or until all the other jobs finish.
<P>
By default, there is no load limit.
