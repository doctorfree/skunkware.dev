<P>
<STRONG>You can run the brief installation procedure if:</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>
You are installing on a standard Unix platform (see section <A HREF="install_33.html#SEC33">Platform names</A>)

<LI>
Your Unix machine has its own device which corresponds to your
distribution media (e.g., a QIC-24 tape drive)

<LI>
You're willing to use the installation directory <TT>`/usr/cygnus'</TT>

<LI>
You have enough disk space in <TT>`/usr/cygnus'</TT> (your tape label lists
the required disk space for binary, source, and both)
</UL>
<P>
Otherwise, see section <A HREF="install_7.html#SEC7">Installing your Developer's Kit distribution</A>.
<P>
<STRONG>Steps for Brief Install:</STRONG>
<P>
(In examples, we show the system prompt as <SAMP>`eg$'</SAMP>.)
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Make sure you can write in <TT>`/usr/cygnus'</TT> by typing:

<PRE>
eg$ su root                <EM>(enter root password)</EM>
# mkdir /usr/cygnus        <EM>(ignore "File exists" error if any)</EM>
# chmod 777 /usr/cygnus
# exit                     <EM>(root access not needed beyond this)</EM>
</PRE>

<LI>
Load the distribution into the drive and extract the <CODE>Install</CODE>
script.  <STRONG>WARNING:</STRONG> you must use a <EM>non--rewinding</EM> tape
device; see section <A HREF="install_4.html#SEC4">Device names</A>.

<PRE>
eg$ cd /tmp
eg$ tar xfv <VAR>device</VAR> Install
</PRE>

<LI>
Run the <CODE>Install</CODE> script:

<PRE>
eg$ ./Install -tape=<VAR>device</VAR>
</PRE>

<CODE>Install</CODE> displays messages about its activity, ending with

<PRE>
Done.
</PRE>

<LI>
Build symbolic links to make execution paths easy (you may need root
access to put the link in <TT>`/usr'</TT>):

<PRE>
eg$ cd /usr/cygnus
eg$ ln -s progressive-95q4 progressive
eg$ su root         
# ln -s /usr/cygnus/progressive/H-<VAR>host</VAR> /usr/progressive
# exit              <EM>(give up root access as soon as possible)</EM>
</PRE>

<LI>
Use your Cygnus Support customer ID (see cover letter) to tag your copy
of our problem-report form:

<PRE>
eg$ /usr/progressive/bin/install-sid <VAR>customer-ID</VAR>
</PRE>

<LI>
Remove public write access from <TT>`/usr/cygnus'</TT>.  See your system
administrator for the correct permissions at your site.
</OL>
<P>
You're done!  Anyone who puts <TT>`/usr/progressive/bin'</TT> in their
<CODE>PATH</CODE> can use this Developer's Kit distribution.
<P>
We have attempted to make the installation of the Cygnus Support
Developer's Kit distribution as trouble-free as possible.  If you
encounter any problems, please contact us:
