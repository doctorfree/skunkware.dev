Once the software is compiled, installation is elementary.  Simply
type:

<PRE>
make install install-info &#62;&#62; make.log
</PRE>

<CODE>make</CODE> installs the Developer's Kit into the locations you
specified on the <CODE>configure</CODE> command line with <SAMP>`--prefix'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`--exec-prefix'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
The Cygnus installation process calls for a few links to be created
after installation, though if you've specified values of
<SAMP>`--prefix'</SAMP> and/or <SAMP>`--exec-prefix'</SAMP> different from the
defaults, your links may be different or even unnecessary.  See section <A HREF="rebuilding_20.html#SEC19">How your Developer's Kit was built</A>, for more information on
these links.

See section <A HREF="rebuilding_20.html#SEC19">How your Developer's Kit was built</A>, and the
<CITE>Installation Notes</CITE>, for more discussion on installing your
Developer's Kit.
