<P>
If your host doesn't have an appropriate tape drive, you may still be
able to install your software.  Check with your system administrator to
see if another machine at your site has a tape drive you can use.  If
so:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><EM>If a shared filesystem is available</EM>
<DD>between the two machines, and it has enough space, create
<SAMP>`/usr/cygnus'</SAMP> on your host (the one where you want to install this
Progressive Release) as a symbolic link to a directory where the other
machine (the one with a tape drive) can write:

<PRE>
ln -s <VAR>shared</VAR> /usr/cygnus
</PRE>

Run <CODE>Install</CODE> from the machine with a tape drive, using the
<SAMP>`extract'</SAMP> argument and the <SAMP>`-installdir'</SAMP> option:

<PRE>
Install extract -installdir=<VAR>shared</VAR>
</PRE>

You still have to finish the installation, but the last
two steps (<CODE>fixincludes</CODE> and <CODE>test</CODE>)
must be run on your host.  (If you forget, there's no great harm done:
<CODE>Install</CODE> notices that it can't carry out a full installation on
the wrong machine, and stops with an error message--then you can go
back and try again.  When <CODE>Install</CODE> notices a problem like this, it
doesn't carry out <EM>any</EM> action other than giving a helpful error
message).

Unless you are installing a cross-development tape (the tape label says
<SAMP>`target = <VAR>target</VAR>'</SAMP> for cross configurations), the
<SAMP>`fixincludes'</SAMP> part of the installation is essential.  Please see
the full explanation (see section <A HREF="install_10.html#SEC10">Why convert system header files?</A>), if you're curious.

<PRE>
<EM>On a machine on your network with a tape drive:</EM>
./Install extract -installdir=<VAR>shared</VAR>/cygnus ...

<EM>On your host</EM>
ln -s <VAR>shared</VAR>/cygnus /usr/cygnus
cd /usr/cygnus/progressive-95q4
</PRE>

If your copy of the Developer's Kit is configured <DFN>native</DFN> (to
develop software for the same type of machine where the Developer's Kit
itself runs), you'll have to run <SAMP>`Install fixincludes'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`Install test'</SAMP> from your host afterwards.

<PRE>
<I>Native configurations only:</I>
./Install fixincludes test
</PRE>


<DT><EM>If some form of filetransfer is available</EM>
<DD>(such as <CODE>uucp</CODE>), read the second file on the tape using a system
utility (for instance, <CODE>dd</CODE> on Unix systems; see the system
documentation for the machine with a tape drive).  There are two files
on the distribution tape; the first contains just the <CODE>Install</CODE>
script in uncompressed <CODE>tar</CODE> format, and the second is a compressed
<CODE>tar</CODE> format file containing the rest of the release.

Read both of these files separately, using something like the following:

<PRE>
eg$ tar xvf <VAR>non-rewinding-tape-device</VAR> Install
Install
eg$ dd if=<VAR>non-rewinding-tape-device</VAR> of=tarfile1 bs=62k
<EM>messages from dd...</EM>
eg$ ls
Install
tarfile1
</PRE>

and then transfer them to your own machine using <CODE>uucp</CODE>,
<CODE>ftp</CODE>, or another appropriate file transfer tool.  (The blocksize
is set to 62k in this example simply to speed up the process; the tape
is written with a blocksize of 62k, but <CODE>dd</CODE> should be able to cope
with the task using its default blocksize.)

Then run <CODE>Install</CODE>, but use <SAMP>`-tape=<VAR>tarfile</VAR>'</SAMP> to specify
the name of the installation file, instead of
<SAMP>`-tape=<VAR>device</VAR>'</SAMP> as shown in the examples.  In the simplest
case, for example (starting after you've transferred <CODE>Install</CODE> and
the tar file to your system):

<PRE>
eg$ ./Install -tape=tarfile1
</PRE>
