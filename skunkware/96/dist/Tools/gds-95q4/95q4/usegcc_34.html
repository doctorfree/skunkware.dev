<H3><A NAME="SEC37" HREF="usegcc_toc.html#TOC37">DEC Alpha Options</A></H3>
<P>
These <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> options are defined for the DEC Alpha implementations:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-mno-soft-float</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-msoft-float</CODE>
<DD>Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
floating-point operations.  When <CODE>-msoft-float</CODE> is specified,
functions in <TT>`libgcc1.c'</TT> will be used to perform floating-point
operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call such
emulations routines, these routines will issue floating-point
operations.   If you are compiling for an Alpha without floating-point
operations, you must ensure that the library is built so as not to call
them.

Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations are
required to have floating-point registers.

<DT><CODE>-mfp-reg</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-fp-regs</CODE>
<DD>Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register set.
<CODE>-mno-fp-regs</CODE> implies <CODE>-msoft-float</CODE>.  If the floating-point
register set is not used, floating point operands are passed in integer
registers as if they were integers and floating-point results are passed
in $0 instead of $f0.  This is a non-standard calling sequence, so any
function with a floating-point argument or return value called by code
compiled with <CODE>-mno-fp-regs</CODE> must also be compiled with that
option.

A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not use,
and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point registers.
