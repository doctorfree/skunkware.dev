<P>
A number of major changes appear in this release of G++.
If some features mentioned below sound unfamiliar, you will probably want to
look at the recently-released public review copy of the <VAR>C++ Working
Paper</VAR>.  For PostScript and PDF (Adobe Acrobat) versions, see the
archive at <TT>`ftp://research.att.com/dist/stdc++/WP'</TT>.  For HTML and ASCII
versions, see <TT>`ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/g++'</TT>.  On the Web, see
<TT>`http://www.cygnus.com/misc/wp-draft'</TT>.

<LI><CODE>-fhandle-exception</CODE>

This is a flag to the C++ frontend.

This option turns on C++ exception handling as documented in the ANSI
draft standard for C++.  This draft standard can be viewed at
<TT>`http://www.cygnus.com/misc/'</TT>.  This option adds some readonly text and
readonly data space overhead necessary for the implementation of
exception handling.  It cannot be used with <CODE>-O</CODE> yet.  The option 
<CODE>-frtti</CODE> can be used in conjunction with this flag to enable subtype 
matching on catch clauses.

<LI>Binary incompatibility

Classes that do not define the copy constructor will sometimes be
passed and returned in registers.  This may illuminate latent bugs in
our code.  This will not affect the SPARC, as the ABI specifies that
structs are never passed in registers.

<LI>Support for automatic template instantiation

For this support to work, the template definition must be available at 
one or more use sites; as ever, G++ will not go looking in other files.  
Use the <CODE>-frepo</CODE> flag when compiling to enable; <CODE>collect2</CODE> will 
recompile affected files as necessary toprovide all needed template 
instantiations.  Do not use <CODE>-fexternal-templates</CODE> with <CODE>-frepo</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>for-init-statement</CODE>

The scope of variables declared in the <CODE>for-init-statement</CODE> has been 
changed to conform to 
<PRE>
http://www.cygnus.com/misc/wp-draft/stmt.html#stmt.for
</PRE>
Most old code will continue to compile with a warning; use
<CODE>-ffor-scope</CODE> to disallow it or <CODE>-fno-for-scope</CODE> to revert to
the old semantics.

<LI><CODE>keyword</CODE> typename for G++

G++ now accepts the typename <CODE>keyword</CODE>, though it currently has no
semantics; it can be a no-op in the current template implementation.
You may want to start using it in your code, however, since the
pending rewrite of the template implementation to compile STL properly
(perhaps for 2.8.0, perhaps not) will require you to use it as
indicated by the current draft.


<LI>Testing conditions improved

The code generated for testing conditions, especially those using <CODE>||</CODE>
and <CODE>&#38;&#38;</CODE>, is now more efficient.

<LI>User-defined type conversion

Handling of user-defined type conversion has been overhauled so that
type conversion operators are now found and used properly in
expressions and function calls.

<LI><CODE>extern inline</CODE>

Functions declared <CODE>extern inline</CODE> now have the same linkage semantics
as inline member functions.  On supported targets, where previously
these functions (and vtables, and template instantiations) would have
been defined statically, they will now be defined as weak symbols so
that only one out-of-line definition is used.

<LI><CODE>collect2</CODE>

<CODE>collect2</CODE> now demangles linker output, and <CODE>c++filt</CODE> has become 
part of the GCC distribution.

<LI>Class template members

Specializations of class template members can now be declared.

<LI>Synthesized methods

Synthesized methods are now emitted exactly as needed; they are no longer
affected by <CODE>#pragma</CODE> interface/implementation or the location of the 
vtable.

<LI>Linking with <CODE>libg++</CODE>

There are two issues:

<OL>
<LI>Symbols referenced by the shared library that wouldn't be referenced
linking with the static library.  Specifically, the <CODE>curses</CODE> functions.

<LI>Finding the shared library at run time.
</OL>

The fixes for the first are:

<OL>
<LI>Don't link with <CODE>libg++</CODE> (if using <CODE>g++</CODE>, use <CODE>c++</CODE>
instead), OR

<LI>Link with <CODE>-lcurses</CODE> (and possibly <CODE>-ltermcap</CODE>), OR

<LI>Remove <TT>`/usr/progressive/lib/libg++.s*'</TT>, OR

<LI>Link with <CODE>-static</CODE> to avoid using any shared libraries
</OL>

The fixes for the second are:

<OL>
<LI>Add <TT>`/usr/progressive/lib'</TT> to your <CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE>
environment variable, OR

<LI>Use the appropriate option when linking:

<CODE>-rpath</CODE> <TT>`/usr/progressive/lib'</TT> for DEC UNIX (OSF/1), <CODE>-R</CODE>  
<TT>`/usr/progressive/lib'</TT> for Solaris.  SunOS 4 does not need such an 
option, nor does AIX.
</OL>
