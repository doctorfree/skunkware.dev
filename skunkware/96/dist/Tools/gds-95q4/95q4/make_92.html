<H2><A NAME="SEC91" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC91">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</A></H2>
<P>
You define an implicit rule by writing a <DFN>pattern rule</DFN>.  A pattern
rule looks like an ordinary rule, except that its target contains the
character <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> (exactly one of them).  The target is considered a
pattern for matching file names; the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> can match any nonempty
substring, while other characters match only themselves.  The dependencies
likewise use <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> to show how their names relate to the target name.
<P>
Thus, a pattern rule <SAMP>`%.o : %.c'</SAMP> says how to make any file
<TT>`<VAR>stem</VAR>.o'</TT> from another file <TT>`<VAR>stem</VAR>.c'</TT>.<P>
Note that expansion using <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> in pattern rules occurs
<STRONG>after</STRONG> any variable or function expansions, which take place
when the makefile is read.  See section <A HREF="make_56.html#SEC55">How to Use Variables</A>, and section <A HREF="make_72.html#SEC71">Functions for Transforming Text</A>.
