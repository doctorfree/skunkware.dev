<H2><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="install_toc.html#TOC29">Installation your Developer's Kit</A></H2>
<P>
We ship your Developer's Kit on a set of floppy disks.  The
<CODE>INSTALL</CODE> program is included on Disk 1.
<P>
The files are stored on the floppies using Microsoft's <CODE>COMPRESS</CODE>
program. If you prefer, you can install files without using the
<CODE>INSTALL</CODE> program by just copying them into the right place on your
hard drive and running <CODE>EXPAND</CODE> on each file.  Since the files are
stored on the floppy using their full name (not those marked as
compressed by using Microsoft's <TT>`.XX_'</TT> naming convention) you
<EM>must</EM> use a temporary file.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>Warning!</EM> If you have a program in your path called <CODE>EXPAND</CODE>
and it's not the one provided by Microsoft, then you should either
change your path to use only the Microsoft <CODE>EXPAND</CODE> program, or be
certain that your <CODE>EXPAND</CODE> program can decompress files which have
been compressed using Microsoft <CODE>COMPRESS</CODE>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
We show the system prompt as <SAMP>`C:\&#62;'</SAMP> for the local hard disk drive,
and <SAMP>`A:\&#62;'</SAMP> for the local 3.5" floppy disk drive.
<P>
For these examples we assume that you install into a directory called
<TT>`C:\CYGNUS'</TT> and that you use drive <TT>`A:'</TT> to read the
installation floppies.  Substitute other hard drives,
installation directories, and floppy drives to match your environment.
<P>
The <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> program first prompts you for an installation
directory:
<P>
At this prompt, enter the name of the directory where you want the tools
to be installed and press <KBD>ENTER</KBD>.  <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> prompts you
(assuming that you accept <SAMP>`C:\CYGNUS'</SAMP>):
<P>
<PRE>
   The installation will write into C:\CYGNUS.
   Are you sure you want to continue [Y] or [N] 
</PRE>
<P>
If you type <CODE>N</CODE>, <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> asks for another path name.  If you
type <CODE>Y</CODE>, <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> begins the installation.
<P>
The program draws a status bar, which fills up as <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> works.
When the box is full, the installation is complete.  <CODE>INSTALL</CODE>
shows the name of the file being processed at the bottom of the screen.
<P>
<CODE>INSTALL</CODE> prompts you for each disk in order.
<P>
To use another installation directory, specify the path to your desired
directory wherever the examples show <TT>`C:\CYGNUS'</TT>
<P>
You must execute the batch file <TT>`SETENV.BAT'</TT> before running the
Developer's Kit.  You can set the environment automatically whenever you
boot the machine by putting the following line in your
<TT>`AUTOEXEC.BAT'</TT>:
<P>
<PRE>
CALL C:\CYGNUS\SETENV.BAT
</PRE>
<P>
(If you install in a location other than <TT>`C:\CYGNUS'</TT>, be sure to
specify the correct directory.)
