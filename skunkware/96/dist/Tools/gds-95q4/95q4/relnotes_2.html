<P>
You can interrogate non-confidential bug reports in the Cygnus Problem
Report Management System (PRMS) by electronic mail.
<P>
Send mail to <SAMP>`query-pr@cygnus.com'</SAMP>, with query parameters in the
<SAMP>`Subject:'</SAMP> line of your mail header.  (The message body is
ignored.)
<P>
For example, to inquire about problem reports numbered <CODE>4020</CODE> and
<CODE>5004</CODE>, send mail including these lines in the header:
<P>
<PRE>
To: query-pr@cygnus.com
Subject: 4020 5004
</PRE>
<P>
You can also include many command line options to request information on
bugs in a particular state, or a particular category; for example, this
header requests a list of all open G++ bugs that are not
confidential:
<P>
<PRE>
To: query-pr@cygnus.com
Subject: --state=open  --category=g++
</PRE>
<P>
If you do not include a <SAMP>`--state='</SAMP> specification in your subject
line, the mail server uses
<P>
<PRE>
--state="open|analyzed|feedback|suspended"
</PRE>
<P>
<EM>Careful!</EM>  Since the default state specification for electronic
mail queries does not include <CODE>closed</CODE>, no news is good news--a
closed bug yields a response with no message body.
<P>
Also, confidential bug reports are not available via the mail query
server.  You can request the status of your confidential PRs from your
Cygnus technical contact.
<P>
Many options are available.  To see a synopsis, send a message like this:
<P>
<PRE>
To: query-pr@cygnus.com
Subject: --help
</PRE>
