<LI>IBM RS/6000
The <CODE>progressive-95q4</CODE> release does <EM>not</EM> include the
following supporting programs in the <EM>native</EM> configuration for
IBM RS/6000.

<PRE>
ar           objcopy      ranlib 
ld           objdump      size   
c++filt      nm           strip  
as
</PRE>

We ship the GNU compiler configured to use the native linker and
assembler, supplied by the machine vendor.

Due to a bug with the AIX 3.2.5 binder, we are unable to build the
following targets:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>rs6000-ibm-aix3.2.5 <EM>native</EM>
<DD><DT>rs6000-ibm-aix3.2.5 <EM>x</EM> i960-vxworks5.0
<DD><DT>rs6000-ibm-aix3.2.5 <EM>x</EM> m68k-aout
<DD><DT>rs6000-ibm-aix3.2.5 <EM>x</EM> powerpc-eabi
<DD></DL>

IBM is sending us a patch for the binder.  Once we receive this patch,
we will test that it works, build and test the above targets and ship
as soon as possible.  We hope to have this resolved by 1 Dec 1995.  This
bug does not affect AIX 4.1.x.

<LI>DEC Alpha running OSF/1 2.0

The <CODE>progressive-95q4</CODE> release does <EM>not</EM> include a linker
(<CODE>ld</CODE>) for the Alpha.  The native linker is used.

<LI>SGI Irix
The Developer's Kit requires the operating system vendor's C library and
include files in a native configuration.  The SGI Irix operating
system does not contain these files by default, but they are included in
a separate developer's package.  You cannot use the Cygnus Developer's
Kit without this package.

<LI>HP9000/700 native
GNU <CODE>ld</CODE> is not included for the HP700 in the native
configuration.
