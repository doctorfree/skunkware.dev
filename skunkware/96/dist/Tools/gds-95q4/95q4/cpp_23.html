<P>
Many C programs define a macro <SAMP>`min'</SAMP>, for "minimum", like this:
<P>
<PRE>
#define min(X, Y)  ((X) &#60; (Y) ? (X) : (Y))
</PRE>
<P>
When you use this macro with an argument containing a side effect,
as shown here,
<P>
<PRE>
next = min (x + y, foo (z));
</PRE>
<P>
it expands as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
next = ((x + y) &#60; (foo (z)) ? (x + y) : (foo (z)));
</PRE>
<P>
where <SAMP>`x + y'</SAMP> has been substituted for <SAMP>`X'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`foo (z)'</SAMP>
for <SAMP>`Y'</SAMP>.
<P>
The function <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> is used only once in the statement as it appears
in the program, but the expression <SAMP>`foo (z)'</SAMP> has been substituted
twice into the macro expansion.  As a result, <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> might be called
two times when the statement is executed.  If it has side effects or
if it takes a long time to compute, the results might not be what you
intended.  We say that <SAMP>`min'</SAMP> is an <DFN>unsafe</DFN> macro.
<P>
The best solution to this problem is to define <SAMP>`min'</SAMP> in a way that
computes the value of <SAMP>`foo (z)'</SAMP> only once.  The C language offers no
standard way to do this, but it can be done with GNU C extensions as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>
#define min(X, Y)                     \
({ typeof (X) __x = (X), __y = (Y);   \
   (__x &#60; __y) ? __x : __y; })
</PRE>
<P>
If you do not wish to use GNU C extensions, the only solution is to be
careful when <EM>using</EM> the macro <SAMP>`min'</SAMP>.  For example, you can
calculate the value of <SAMP>`foo (z)'</SAMP>, save it in a variable, and use that
variable in <SAMP>`min'</SAMP>:
<P>
<PRE>
#define min(X, Y)  ((X) &#60; (Y) ? (X) : (Y))
...
{
  int tem = foo (z);
  next = min (x + y, tem);
}
</PRE>
<P>
(where we assume that <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> returns type <SAMP>`int'</SAMP>).
