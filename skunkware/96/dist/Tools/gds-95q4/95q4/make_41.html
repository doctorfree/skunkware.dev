<P>
<DFN>Double-colon</DFN> rules are rules written with <SAMP>`::'</SAMP> instead of
<SAMP>`:'</SAMP> after the target names.  They are handled differently from
ordinary rules when the same target appears in more than one rule.
<P>
When a target appears in multiple rules, all the rules must be the same
type: all ordinary, or all double-colon.  If they are double-colon, each of
them is independent of the others.  Each double-colon rule's commands are
executed if the target is older than any dependencies of that rule.  This
can result in executing none, any, or all of the double-colon rules.
<P>
Double-colon rules with the same target are in fact completely separate
from one another.  Each double-colon rule is processed individually, just
as rules with different targets are processed.
<P>
The double-colon rules for a target are executed in the order they appear
in the makefile.  However, the cases where double-colon rules really make
sense are those where the order of executing the commands would not matter.
<P>
Double-colon rules are somewhat obscure and not often very useful; they
provide a mechanism for cases in which the method used to update a target
differs depending on which dependency files caused the update, and such
cases are rare.
<P>
Each double-colon rule should specify commands; if it does not, an
implicit rule will be used if one applies.
