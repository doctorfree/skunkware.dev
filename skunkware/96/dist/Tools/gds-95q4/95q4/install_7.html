<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="install_toc.html#TOC7">Installing your Developer's Kit distribution</A></H2>
<P>
There are a few steps to follow in installing the software in the
Developer's Kit distribution onto your system.
<P>
<EM>Note:</EM> For Unix distributions, your distribution tape includes two
files:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>Install</CODE>
<DD>The <CODE>Install</CODE> shell script is a portable installation procedure
which automatically installs the software on your system
(see section <A HREF="install_8.html#SEC8">Invoking the <CODE>Install</CODE> script</A>).

<DT><EM>distribution <CODE>tar</CODE> file</EM>
<DD>The binaries and source for the Developer's Kit distribution are located
in a single compressed <CODE>tar</CODE> file.
</DL>
<P>
In order for <CODE>Install</CODE> to read and install your distribution, you
<EM>must</EM> use a <EM>non--rewinding</EM> tape device, so that the tape
drive maintains the tape location at the beginning of the compressed
<CODE>tar</CODE> file after you extract <CODE>Install</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="install_4.html#SEC4">Device names</A>, for a list of default device names for each host
type.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
First, decide where to install the software.  The default installation
location is <TT>`/usr/cygnus/progressive-95q4'</TT>.
(To use the software conveniently from elsewhere, you may want to
reconfigure and recompile from source; see section <A HREF="install_16.html#SEC16">Running the programs</A>.)

If you don't wish to install in <TT>`/usr/cygnus'</TT> but can create a
symbolic link to it from another location,
or if you don't wish to install into <TT>`/usr'</TT> at all,
see section <A HREF="install_14.html#SEC14">Installing in a nonstandard location</A>.

<LI>
Create the installation directory, if it doesn't already exist, and make
sure it's publicly accessible so <CODE>Install</CODE> can write there.  For
example, if you use the default installation directory of
<TT>`/usr/cygnus'</TT>:

<PRE>
eg$ su root             <EM>(enter root password to write in <TT>`/usr'</TT>)</EM>
# mkdir /usr/cygnus     <EM>(ignore "File exists" error if any)</EM>
# chmod 777 /usr/cygnus
# exit                  <EM>(root access not needed beyond this)</EM>
</PRE>

<LI>
Make sure you have enough space for the tools in your chosen
installation location.  The required disk usage for the Developer's Kit
is printed on the tape label; values for binaries only, sources only, or
both are shown.

<LI>
Load the Developer's Kit distribution tape into your tape drive.  If
your machine doesn't have its own tape drive, you need to first extract
the software into a location accessible by both your host and the
machine that has a tape drive, and then install on your host.  If there
is no shared disk, you can extract the software on the machine with the
tape drive and then transfer it over to your host.  section <A HREF="install_15.html#SEC15">Installing with a remote tape drive</A>, for details.

<LI>
Extract the <CODE>Install</CODE> script off the tape using

<PRE>
tar xvf <VAR>non-rewinding-tapedev</VAR> Install
</PRE>

Remember to use a <EM>non--rewinding</EM> tape drive!

<LI>
Run <CODE>Install</CODE>, using command-line options and arguments to specify
the details about your installation.

Default behavior installs both binaries and source under
<TT>`/usr/cygnus/progressive-95q4'</TT> using the default
non--rewinding tape drive for your system (see section <A HREF="install_4.html#SEC4">Device names</A>).
For <DFN>native</DFN> toolchains only, a process called <DFN>fixincludes</DFN>
automatically makes copies of your system header files and alters them
to work with GCC (your system's header files are <EM>not
changed</EM>; see section <A HREF="install_10.html#SEC10">Why convert system header files?</A>).
Finally, <CODE>Install</CODE> runs a simple test to make sure your
distribution was installed correctly.

<LI>
Make sure the program <CODE>send-pr</CODE> knows your Cygnus customer
identification code.  You can install your customer ID by using the
program <CODE>install-sid</CODE> as follows:

<PRE>
eg$ cd /usr/cygnus/progressive-95q4/H-<VAR>hosttype</VAR>/bin
eg$ install-sid <VAR>customer-ID</VAR>
</PRE>

Contact Cygnus Support at +1 415 903 1401 if you do not know your
customer ID.

<LI>
Create symbolic links so that your newly installed Developer's Kit is
easily accessible to developers, able to exist with other
Developer's Kit installations in a heterogeneous environment, and easily
updated when you install a new Developer's Kit.

The nature of the links depends on where you installed the
Developer's Kit release, but they follow the example below.  If you
installed into <TT>`/usr/cygnus/progressive-95q4'</TT>, the links are

<PRE>
ln -s /usr/cygnus/progressive-95q4 /usr/cygnus/progressive
ln -s /usr/cygnus/progressive/H-<VAR>hosttype</VAR> /usr/progressive 
</PRE>

See section <A HREF="install_11.html#SEC11">Links for easy access and updating</A>, for more information
on these links.

You're done!  The installation is now online; anyone who puts

<PRE>
/usr/progressive/bin
</PRE>

in their path has access to the toolkit.

<LI>
If you had to change the permission status on the directory
<TT>`/usr/cygnus'</TT>, be sure to revert the change.  See your system
administrator for the proper permissions at your site.
