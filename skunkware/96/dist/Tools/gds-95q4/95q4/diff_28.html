<P>
The <SAMP>`-y'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--side-by-side'</SAMP> option selects side by side
format.  Because side by side output lines contain two input lines, they
are wider than usual.  They are normally 130 columns, which can fit onto
a traditional printer line.  You can set the length of output lines with
the <SAMP>`-W <VAR>columns</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--width=<VAR>columns</VAR>'</SAMP> option.  The
output line is split into two halves of equal length, separated by a
small gutter to mark differences; the right half is aligned to a tab
stop so that tabs line up.  Input lines that are too long to fit in half
of an output line are truncated for output.
<P>
The <SAMP>`--left-column'</SAMP> option prints only the left column of two
common lines.  The <SAMP>`--suppress-common-lines'</SAMP> option suppresses
common lines entirely.
