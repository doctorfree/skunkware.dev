<LI>
The <CODE>fixincludes</CODE> script interacts badly with automounters; if the
directory of system header files is automounted, it tends to be
unmounted while <CODE>fixincludes</CODE> is running.  This would seem to be a
bug in the automounter.  We don't know any good way to work around it.

<LI>
The <CODE>fixproto</CODE> script will sometimes add prototypes for the
<CODE>sigsetjmp</CODE> and <CODE>siglongjmp</CODE> functions that reference the
<CODE>jmp_buf</CODE> type before that type is defined.  To work around this,
edit the offending file and place the typedef in front of the
prototypes.

<LI>
There are several obscure case of mis-using struct, union, and 
enum tags that are not detected as errors by the compiler.

<LI>
When <SAMP>`-pedantic-errors'</SAMP> is specified, GNU C will incorrectly give
an error message when a function name is specified in an expression
involving the comma operator.

<LI>
Loop unrolling doesn't work properly for certain C++ programs.  This is
a bug in the C++ front end.  It sometimes emits incorrect debug info, and
the loop unrolling code is unable to recover from this error.
