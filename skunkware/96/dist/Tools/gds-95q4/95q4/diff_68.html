<P>
<CODE>patch</CODE> can produce a variety of messages, especially if it has
trouble decoding its input.  In a few situations where it's not sure how
to proceed, <CODE>patch</CODE> normally prompts you for more information from
the keyboard.  There are options to suppress printing non-fatal messages
and stopping for keyboard input.
<P>
The message <SAMP>`Hmm...'</SAMP> indicates that <CODE>patch</CODE> is reading text in
the patch file, attempting to determine whether there is a patch in that
text, and if so, what kind of patch it is.
<P>
You can inhibit all terminal output from <CODE>patch</CODE>, unless an error
occurs, by using the <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`--quiet'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`--silent'</SAMP>
option.
<P>
There are two ways you can prevent <CODE>patch</CODE> from asking you any
questions.  The <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--force'</SAMP> option assumes that you know
what you are doing.  It assumes the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
skip patches that do not contain file names in their headers;

<LI>
patch files even though they have the wrong version for the
<SAMP>`Prereq:'</SAMP> line in the patch;

<LI>
assume that patches are not reversed even if they look like they are.
</UL>
<P>
The <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--batch'</SAMP> option is similar to <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP>, in that
it suppresses questions, but it makes somewhat different assumptions:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
skip patches that do not contain file names in their headers
(the same as <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP>);

<LI>
skip patches for which the file has the wrong version for the
<SAMP>`Prereq:'</SAMP> line in the patch;

<LI>
assume that patches are reversed if they look like they are.
</UL>
<P>
<CODE>patch</CODE> exits with a non-zero status if it creates any reject
files.  When applying a set of patches in a loop, you should check the
exit status, so you don't apply a later patch to a partially patched
file.
