<P>
You can override a built-in implicit rule (or one you have defined
yourself) by defining a new pattern rule with the same target and

built-in one is replaced.  The new rule's position in the sequence of
implicit rules is determined by where you write the new rule.
<P>
You can cancel a built-in implicit rule by defining a pattern rule with the
same target and dependencies, but no commands.  For example, the following
would cancel the rule that runs the assembler:
