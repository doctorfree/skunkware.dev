<TITLE>The C Preprocessor - Include Operation</TITLE>

<H3><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="cpp_toc.html#TOC7">How <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> Works</A></H3>
<P>
The <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> directive works by directing the C preprocessor to scan
the specified file as input before continuing with the rest of the current
file.  The output from the preprocessor contains the output already
generated, followed by the output resulting from the included file,
followed by the output that comes from the text after the <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP>
directive.  For example, given a header file <TT>`header.h'</TT> as follows,
<P>
<PRE>
char *test ();
</PRE>
<P>
and a main program called <TT>`program.c'</TT> that uses the header file,
like this,
<P>
<PRE>
int x;
#include "header.h"

main ()
{
  printf (test ());
}
</PRE>
<P>
the output generated by the C preprocessor for <TT>`program.c'</TT> as input
would be
<P>
<PRE>
int x;
char *test ();

main ()
{
  printf (test ());
}
</PRE>
<P>
Included files are not limited to declarations and macro definitions; those
are merely the typical uses.  Any fragment of a C program can be included
from another file.  The include file could even contain the beginning of a
statement that is concluded in the containing file, or the end of a
statement that was started in the including file.  However, a comment or a
string or character constant may not start in the included file and finish
in the including file.  An unterminated comment, string constant or
character constant in an included file is considered to end (with an error
message) at the end of the file.
<P>
It is possible for a header file to begin or end a syntactic unit such
as a function definition, but that would be very confusing, so don't do
it.
<P>
The line following the <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> directive is always treated as a
separate line by the C preprocessor even if the included file lacks a final
newline.
