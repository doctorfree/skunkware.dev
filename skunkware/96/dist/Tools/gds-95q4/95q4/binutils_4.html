<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="binutils_toc.html#TOC3">Controlling <CODE>ar</CODE> with a script</A></H2>
<P>

<P>
If you use the single command-line option <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> with <CODE>ar</CODE>, you
can control its operation with a rudimentary command language.  This
form of <CODE>ar</CODE> operates interactively if standard input is coming
directly from a terminal.  During interactive use, <CODE>ar</CODE> prompts for
input (the prompt is <SAMP>`AR &#62;'</SAMP>), and continues executing even after
errors.  If you redirect standard input to a script file, no prompts are
issued, and <CODE>ar</CODE> abandons execution (with a nonzero exit code)
on any error.
<P>
The <CODE>ar</CODE> command language is <EM>not</EM> designed to be equivalent
to the command-line options; in fact, it provides somewhat less control
over archives.  The only purpose of the command language is to ease the
transition to GNU <CODE>ar</CODE> for developers who already have scripts
written for the MRI "librarian" program.
<P>
The syntax for the <CODE>ar</CODE> command language is straightforward:
<UL>
<LI>
commands are recognized in upper or lower case; for example, <CODE>LIST</CODE>
is the same as <CODE>list</CODE>.  In the following descriptions, commands are
shown in upper case for clarity.

<LI>
a single command may appear on each line; it is the first word on the
line.

<LI>
empty lines are allowed, and have no effect.

<LI>
comments are allowed; text after either of the characters <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`;'</SAMP> is ignored.

<LI>
Whenever you use a list of names as part of the argument to an <CODE>ar</CODE>
command, you can separate the individual names with either commas or
blanks.  Commas are shown in the explanations below, for clarity.

<LI>
<SAMP>`+'</SAMP> is used as a line continuation character; if <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> appears
at the end of a line, the text on the following line is considered part
of the current command.
</UL>
<P>
Here are the commands you can use in <CODE>ar</CODE> scripts, or when using
<CODE>ar</CODE> interactively.  Three of them have special significance:
<P>
<CODE>OPEN</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE</CODE> specify a <DFN>current archive</DFN>, which is
a temporary file required for most of the other commands.
<P>
<CODE>SAVE</CODE> commits the changes so far specified by the script.  Prior
to <CODE>SAVE</CODE>, commands affect only the temporary copy of the current
archive.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>ADDLIB <VAR>archive</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>ADDLIB <VAR>archive</VAR> (<VAR>module</VAR>, <VAR>module</VAR>, ... <VAR>module</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Add all the contents of <VAR>archive</VAR> (or, if specified, each named
<VAR>module</VAR> from <VAR>archive</VAR>) to the current archive.

Requires prior use of <CODE>OPEN</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>ADDMOD <VAR>member</VAR>, <VAR>member</VAR>, ... <VAR>member</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Add each named <VAR>member</VAR> as a module in the current archive.

Requires prior use of <CODE>OPEN</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>CLEAR</CODE>
<DD>Discard the contents of the current archive, cancelling the effect of
any operations since the last <CODE>SAVE</CODE>.  May be executed (with no
effect) even if  no current archive is specified.

<DT><CODE>CREATE <VAR>archive</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Creates an archive, and makes it the current archive (required for many
other commands).  The new archive is created with a temporary name; it
is not actually saved as <VAR>archive</VAR> until you use <CODE>SAVE</CODE>.
You can overwrite existing archives; similarly, the contents of any
existing file named <VAR>archive</VAR> will not be destroyed until <CODE>SAVE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>DELETE <VAR>module</VAR>, <VAR>module</VAR>, ... <VAR>module</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Delete each listed <VAR>module</VAR> from the current archive; equivalent to
<SAMP>`ar -d <VAR>archive</VAR> <VAR>module</VAR> ... <VAR>module</VAR>'</SAMP>.

Requires prior use of <CODE>OPEN</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>DIRECTORY <VAR>archive</VAR> (<VAR>module</VAR>, ... <VAR>module</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>DIRECTORY <VAR>archive</VAR> (<VAR>module</VAR>, ... <VAR>module</VAR>) <VAR>outputfile</VAR></CODE>
<DD>List each named <VAR>module</VAR> present in <VAR>archive</VAR>.  The separate
command <CODE>VERBOSE</CODE> specifies the form of the output: when verbose
output is off, output is like that of <SAMP>`ar -t <VAR>archive</VAR>
<VAR>module</VAR>...'</SAMP>.  When verbose output is on, the listing is like
<SAMP>`ar -tv <VAR>archive</VAR> <VAR>module</VAR>...'</SAMP>.

Output normally goes to the standard output stream; however, if you
specify <VAR>outputfile</VAR> as a final argument, <CODE>ar</CODE> directs the
output to that file.

<DT><CODE>END</CODE>
<DD>Exit from <CODE>ar</CODE>, with a <CODE>0</CODE> exit code to indicate successful
completion.  This command does not save the output file; if you have
changed the current archive since the last <CODE>SAVE</CODE> command, those
changes are lost.

<DT><CODE>EXTRACT <VAR>module</VAR>, <VAR>module</VAR>, ... <VAR>module</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Extract each named <VAR>module</VAR> from the current archive, writing them
into the current directory as separate files.  Equivalent to <SAMP>`ar -x
<VAR>archive</VAR> <VAR>module</VAR>...'</SAMP>.

Requires prior use of <CODE>OPEN</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE</CODE>.


<DT><CODE>LIST</CODE>
<DD>Display full contents of the current archive, in "verbose" style
regardless of the state of <CODE>VERBOSE</CODE>.  The effect is like <SAMP>`ar
tv <VAR>archive</VAR>'</SAMP>).  (This single command is a GNU <CODE>ld</CODE>
enhancement, rather than present for MRI compatibility.)

Requires prior use of <CODE>OPEN</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>OPEN <VAR>archive</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Opens an existing archive for use as the current archive (required for
many other commands).  Any changes as the result of subsequent commands
will not actually affect <VAR>archive</VAR> until you next use <CODE>SAVE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>REPLACE <VAR>module</VAR>, <VAR>module</VAR>, ... <VAR>module</VAR></CODE>
<DD>In the current archive, replace each existing <VAR>module</VAR> (named in
the <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> arguments) from files in the current working directory.
To execute this command without errors, both the file, and the module in
the current archive, must exist. 

Requires prior use of <CODE>OPEN</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>VERBOSE</CODE>
<DD>Toggle an internal flag governing the output from <CODE>DIRECTORY</CODE>.
When the flag is on, <CODE>DIRECTORY</CODE> output matches output from
<SAMP>`ar -tv '</SAMP>....

<DT><CODE>SAVE</CODE>
<DD>Commit your changes to the current archive, and actually save it as a
file with the name specified in the last <CODE>CREATE</CODE> or <CODE>OPEN</CODE>
command. 

Requires prior use of <CODE>OPEN</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE</CODE>.
