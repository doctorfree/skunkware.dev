<P>
<CODE>send-pr</CODE> is capable of sending Problem Reports to any number of
Support Sites, using mail aliases which have <SAMP>`-prms'</SAMP> appended them.
<CODE>send-pr</CODE> automatically appends the suffix, so that when you type
<P>
<PRE>
send-pr <VAR>site</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
the Problem Report goes to the address noted in the <TT>`aliases'</TT> file
as <SAMP>`<VAR>site</VAR>-prms'</SAMP>.  You can do this in the Emacs version of
<CODE>send-pr</CODE> by invoking the program with
<P>
<PRE>
C-u M-x send-pr
</PRE>
<P>
You are prompted for <VAR>site</VAR>.
<P>
<VAR>site</VAR> is also used to error-check the <SAMP>`&#62;Category:'</SAMP> field, as a
precaution against sending mistaken information (and against sending
information to the wrong site).
<P>
You may also simply type
<P>
<PRE>
send-pr
</PRE>
<P>
from the shell (or <SAMP>`M-x send-pr'</SAMP> in Emacs), and the Problem
Report you generate will be sent to the <VAR>site</VAR>, which is usually the
site from which you received your distribution of <CODE>send-pr</CODE>.
If you use PRMS at your own organization, the default is usually
your local address for reporting problems.
<P>
To change this, simply edit the file <TT>`Makefile'</TT> before installing
and change the line 
<P>
<PRE>
PRMS_SITE = <VAR>site</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
to reflect the site where you wish to send PRs by default.
