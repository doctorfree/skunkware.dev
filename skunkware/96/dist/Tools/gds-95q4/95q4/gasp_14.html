<TITLE>GASP, an assembly preprocessor - Markers</TITLE>

<P>
GASP recognizes a few special markers: to delimit comments, to
continue a statement on the next line, to separate symbols from other
characters, and to copy text to the output literally.  (One other
special marker, <SAMP>`\@'</SAMP>, works only within macro definitions;
see section <A HREF="gasp_7.html#SEC7">Defining your own directives</A>.)
<A NAME="IDX111"></A>
<P>
The trailing part of any GASP source line may be a <DFN>comment</DFN>.
A comment begins with the first unquoted comment character (<SAMP>`!'</SAMP> by
default), or an escaped or doubled comment character (<SAMP>`\!'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`!!'</SAMP> by default), and extends to the end of a line.  You can
specify what comment character to use with the <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP> option
(see section <A HREF="gasp_2.html#SEC2">Command Line Options</A>).  The two kinds of
comment markers lead to slightly different treatment:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>!</CODE>
<DD>A single, un-escaped comment character generates an assembly comment in
the GASP output.  GASP evaluates any preprocessor variables
(macro arguments, or variables defined with <CODE>.ASSIGNA</CODE> or
<CODE>.ASSIGNC</CODE>) present.  For example, a macro that begins like this

<PRE>
        .MACRO  SUM FROM=0, TO=9
        ! \FROM \TO
</PRE>

issues as the first line of output a comment that records the
values you used to call the macro.

<DT><CODE>\!</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>!!</CODE>
<DD>Either an escaped comment character, or a double comment character,
marks a GASP source comment.  GASP does not copy such comments
to the assembly output.
</DL>

<A NAME="IDX113"></A>
<P>
To <EM>continue a statement</EM> on the next line of the file, begin the
second line with the character <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>.
<A NAME="IDX114"></A>
<A NAME="IDX115"></A>
<A NAME="IDX116"></A>
<A NAME="IDX117"></A>
<P>
Occasionally you may want to prevent GASP from preprocessing some
particular bit of text.  To <EM>copy literally</EM> from the GASP
source to its output, place <SAMP>`\('</SAMP> before the string to copy, and
<SAMP>`)'</SAMP> at the end.  For example, write <SAMP>`\(\!)'</SAMP> if you need the
characters <SAMP>`\!'</SAMP> in your assembly output.
<A NAME="IDX118"></A>
<A NAME="IDX119"></A>
<A NAME="IDX120"></A>
<P>
To <EM>separate a preprocessor variable</EM> from text to appear
immediately after its value, write a single quote (<CODE>'</CODE>).  For
example, <SAMP>`.SDATA "\P'1"'</SAMP> writes a string built by concatenating the
value of <CODE>P</CODE> and the digit <SAMP>`1'</SAMP>.  (You cannot achieve this by
writing just <SAMP>`\P1'</SAMP>, since <SAMP>`P1'</SAMP> is itself a valid name for a
preprocessor variable.)
