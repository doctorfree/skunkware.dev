<H3><A NAME="SEC50" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC50">Communicating Variables to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A></H3>
<P>
Variable values of the top-level <CODE>make</CODE> can be passed to the
sub-<CODE>make</CODE> through the environment by explicit request.  These
variables are defined in the sub-<CODE>make</CODE> as defaults, but do not
override what is specified in the makefile used by the sub-<CODE>make</CODE>
makefile unless you use the <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> switch (see section <A HREF="make_86.html#SEC85">Summary of Options</A>).<P>
To pass down, or <DFN>export</DFN>, a variable, <CODE>make</CODE> adds the variable
and its value to the environment for running each command.  The
sub-<CODE>make</CODE>, in turn, uses the environment to initialize its table
of variable values.  See section <A HREF="make_67.html#SEC66">Variables from the Environment</A>.
<P>
Except by explicit request, <CODE>make</CODE> exports a variable only if it
is either defined in the environment initially or set on the command
line, and if its name consists only of letters, numbers, and underscores.
Some shells cannot cope with environment variable names consisting of
characters other than letters, numbers, and underscores.
<P>
The special variables <CODE>SHELL</CODE> and <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> are always
exported (unless you unexport them).
<CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> is exported if you set it to anything.
<P>
<CODE>make</CODE> automatically passes down variable values that were defined
on the command line, by putting them in the <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> variable.
See the next section.
<P>
Variables are <EM>not</EM> normally passed down if they were created by
default by <CODE>make</CODE> (see section <A HREF="make_90.html#SEC89">Variables Used by Implicit Rules</A>).  The sub-<CODE>make</CODE> will define these for
itself.<A NAME="IDX312"></A>
<P>
If you want to export specific variables to a sub-<CODE>make</CODE>, use the
<CODE>export</CODE> directive, like this:
<P>
<PRE>
export <VAR>variable</VAR> ...
</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX313"></A>
If you want to <EM>prevent</EM> a variable from being exported, use the
<CODE>unexport</CODE> directive, like this:
<P>
<PRE>
unexport <VAR>variable</VAR> ...
</PRE>
<P>
As a convenience, you can define a variable and export it at the same
time by doing:
<P>
<PRE>
export <VAR>variable</VAR> = value
</PRE>
<P>
has the same result as:
<P>
<PRE>
<VAR>variable</VAR> = value
export <VAR>variable</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
and
<P>
<PRE>
export <VAR>variable</VAR> := value
</PRE>
<P>
has the same result as:
<P>
<PRE>
<VAR>variable</VAR> := value
export <VAR>variable</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
Likewise,
<P>
<PRE>
export <VAR>variable</VAR> += value
</PRE>
<P>
is just like:
<P>
<PRE>
<VAR>variable</VAR> += value
export <VAR>variable</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
See section <A HREF="make_64.html#SEC63">Appending More Text to Variables</A>.
<P>
You may notice that the <CODE>export</CODE> and <CODE>unexport</CODE> directives
work in <CODE>make</CODE> in the same way they work in the shell, <CODE>sh</CODE>.
<P>
If you want all variables to be exported by default, you can use
<CODE>export</CODE> by itself:
<P>
<PRE>
export
</PRE>
<P>
This tells <CODE>make</CODE> that variables which are not explicitly mentioned
in an <CODE>export</CODE> or <CODE>unexport</CODE> directive should be exported.
Any variable given in an <CODE>unexport</CODE> directive will still <EM>not</EM>
be exported.  If you use <CODE>export</CODE> by itself to export variables by
default, variables whose names contain characters other than
alphanumerics and underscores will not be exported unless specifically
mentioned in an <CODE>export</CODE> directive.<A NAME="IDX314"></A>
<P>
The behavior elicited by an <CODE>export</CODE> directive by itself was the
default in older versions of GNU <CODE>make</CODE>.  If your makefiles depend
on this behavior and you want to be compatible with old versions of
<CODE>make</CODE>, you can write a rule for the special target
<CODE>.EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES</CODE> instead of using the <CODE>export</CODE> directive.
This will be ignored by old <CODE>make</CODE>s, while the <CODE>export</CODE>
directive will cause a syntax error.<A NAME="IDX315"></A>
<P>
Likewise, you can use <CODE>unexport</CODE> by itself to tell <CODE>make</CODE>
<EM>not</EM> to export variables by default.  Since this is the default
behavior, you would only need to do this if <CODE>export</CODE> had been used
by itself earlier (in an included makefile, perhaps).  You
<STRONG>cannot</STRONG> use <CODE>export</CODE> and <CODE>unexport</CODE> by themselves to
have variables exported for some commands and not for others.  The last
<CODE>export</CODE> or <CODE>unexport</CODE> directive that appears by itself
determines the behavior for the entire run of <CODE>make</CODE>.<A NAME="IDX316"></A>
<A NAME="IDX317"></A>
<P>
As a special feature, the variable <CODE>MAKELEVEL</CODE> is changed when it
is passed down from level to level.  This variable's value is a string
which is the depth of the level as a decimal number.  The value is
<SAMP>`0'</SAMP> for the top-level <CODE>make</CODE>; <SAMP>`1'</SAMP> for a sub-<CODE>make</CODE>,
<SAMP>`2'</SAMP> for a sub-sub-<CODE>make</CODE>, and so on.  The incrementation
happens when <CODE>make</CODE> sets up the environment for a command.<P>
The main use of <CODE>MAKELEVEL</CODE> is to test it in a conditional
directive (see section <A HREF="make_68.html#SEC67">Conditional Parts of Makefiles</A>); this
way you can write a makefile that behaves one way if run recursively and
another way if run directly by you.<A NAME="IDX318"></A>
<P>
You can use the variable <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> to cause all sub-<CODE>make</CODE>
commands to use additional makefiles.  The value of <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> is
a whitespace-separated list of file names.  This variable, if defined in
the outer-level makefile, is passed down through the environment; then
it serves as a list of extra makefiles for the sub-<CODE>make</CODE> to read
before the usual or specified ones.  See section <A HREF="make_17.html#SEC16">The Variable <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE></A>.<P>
