<H2><A NAME="SEC63" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC63">Appending More Text to Variables</A></H2>
<P>
Often it is useful to add more text to the value of a variable already defined.
You do this with a line containing <SAMP>`+='</SAMP>, like this:
<P>
<PRE>
objects += another.o
</PRE>
<P>
This takes the value of the variable <CODE>objects</CODE>, and adds the text
<SAMP>`another.o'</SAMP> to it (preceded by a single space).  Thus:
<P>
<PRE>
objects = main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o
objects += another.o
</PRE>
<P>
sets <CODE>objects</CODE> to <SAMP>`main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o another.o'</SAMP>.
<P>
Using <SAMP>`+='</SAMP> is similar to:
<P>
<PRE>
objects = main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o
objects := $(objects) another.o
</PRE>
<P>
but differs in ways that become important when you use more complex values.
<P>
When the variable in question has not been defined before, <SAMP>`+='</SAMP>
acts just like normal <SAMP>`='</SAMP>: it defines a recursively-expanded
variable.  However, when there <EM>is</EM> a previous definition, exactly
what <SAMP>`+='</SAMP> does depends on what flavor of variable you defined
originally.  See section <A HREF="make_58.html#SEC57">The Two Flavors of Variables</A>, for an
explanation of the two flavors of variables.
<P>
When you add to a variable's value with <SAMP>`+='</SAMP>, <CODE>make</CODE> acts
essentially as if you had included the extra text in the initial
definition of the variable.  If you defined it first with <SAMP>`:='</SAMP>,
making it a simply-expanded variable, <SAMP>`+='</SAMP> adds to that
simply-expanded definition, and expands the new text before appending it
to the old value just as <SAMP>`:='</SAMP> does
(see section <A HREF="make_63.html#SEC62">Setting Variables</A>, for a full explanation of <SAMP>`:='</SAMP>).
In fact,
<P>
<PRE>
variable := value
variable += more
</PRE>
<P>
is exactly equivalent to:
<P>
<PRE>
variable := value
variable := $(variable) more
</PRE>
<P>
On the other hand, when you use <SAMP>`+='</SAMP> with a variable that you defined
first to be recursively-expanded using plain <SAMP>`='</SAMP>, <CODE>make</CODE> does
something a bit different.  Recall that when you define a
recursively-expanded variable, <CODE>make</CODE> does not expand the value you set
for variable and function references immediately.  Instead it stores the text
verbatim, and saves these variable and function references to be expanded
later, when you refer to the new variable (see section <A HREF="make_58.html#SEC57">The Two Flavors of Variables</A>).  When you use <SAMP>`+='</SAMP> on a recursively-expanded variable,
it is this unexpanded text to which <CODE>make</CODE> appends the new text you
specify.
<P>
<PRE>
variable = value
variable += more
</PRE>
<P>
is roughly equivalent to:
<P>
<PRE>
temp = value
variable = $(temp) more
</PRE>
<P>
except that of course it never defines a variable called <CODE>temp</CODE>.
The importance of this comes when the variable's old value contains
variable references.  Take this common example:
<P>
<PRE>
CFLAGS = $(includes) -O
...
CFLAGS += -pg # enable profiling
</PRE>
<P>
The first line defines the <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> variable with a reference to another
variable, <CODE>includes</CODE>.  (<CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> is used by the rules for C
compilation; see section <A HREF="make_89.html#SEC88">Catalogue of Implicit Rules</A>.)
Using <SAMP>`='</SAMP> for the definition makes <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> a recursively-expanded
variable, meaning <SAMP>`$(includes) -O'</SAMP> is <EM>not</EM> expanded when
<CODE>make</CODE> processes the definition of <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>.  Thus, <CODE>includes</CODE>
need not be defined yet for its value to take effect.  It only has to be
defined before any reference to <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>.  If we tried to append to the
value of <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> without using <SAMP>`+='</SAMP>, we might do it like this:
<P>
<PRE>
CFLAGS := $(CFLAGS) -pg # enable profiling
</PRE>
<P>
This is pretty close, but not quite what we want.  Using <SAMP>`:='</SAMP>
redefines <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> as a simply-expanded variable; this means
<CODE>make</CODE> expands the text <SAMP>`$(CFLAGS) -pg'</SAMP> before setting the
variable.  If <CODE>includes</CODE> is not yet defined, we get <SAMP>` -O
-pg'</SAMP>, and a later definition of <CODE>includes</CODE> will have no effect.
Conversely, by using <SAMP>`+='</SAMP> we set <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> to the
<EM>unexpanded</EM> value <SAMP>`$(includes) -O -pg'</SAMP>.  Thus we preserve
the reference to <CODE>includes</CODE>, so if that variable gets defined at
any later point, a reference like <SAMP>`$(CFLAGS)'</SAMP> still uses its
value.
