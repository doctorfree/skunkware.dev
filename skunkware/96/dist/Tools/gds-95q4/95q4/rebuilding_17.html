<H4><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="rebuilding_toc.html#SEC16">The Heterogeneous part</A></H4>

<P>
The installed distribution is useful in a heterogeneous environment due
to the properties of local public installation directories like
<TT>`/usr'</TT>.  <TT>`/usr'</TT> is local to each machine, even machines of the
same architecture.  However, subdirectories of <TT>`/usr'</TT> can be
symbolic links to other locations on disks shared throughout the
network.

</P>
<P>
The HUT creation process (and the Cygnus progressive installation
process) suggests the symbolic link

</P>

<PRE>
ln -s /usr/cygnus/progressive/H-<VAR>hosttype</VAR> /usr/progressive
</PRE>

<P>
on each host for which the toolkit is installed.  This way, users on
each system have access to the Developer's Kit through
<SAMP>`/usr/progressive/bin'</SAMP>, since <SAMP>`/usr/progressive'</SAMP> on
each <VAR>hosttype</VAR> points to the binaries for that <VAR>hosttype</VAR>.
