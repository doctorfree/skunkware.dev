<P>
A <DFN>conditional</DFN> causes part of a makefile to be obeyed or ignored
depending on the values of variables.  Conditionals can compare the
value of one variable to another, or the value of a variable to
a constant string.  Conditionals control what <CODE>make</CODE> actually
"sees" in the makefile, so they <EM>cannot</EM> be used to control shell
commands at the time of execution.<P>
