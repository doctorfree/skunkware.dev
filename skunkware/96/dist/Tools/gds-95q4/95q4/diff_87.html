<P>
Some files are neither directories nor regular files: they are unusual
files like symbolic links, device special files, named pipes, and
sockets.  Currently, <CODE>diff</CODE> treats symbolic links like regular files;
it treats other special files like regular files if they are specified
at the top level, but simply reports their presence when comparing
directories.  This means that <CODE>patch</CODE> cannot represent changes
to such files.  For example, if you change which file a symbolic link
points to, <CODE>diff</CODE> outputs the difference between the two files,
instead of the change to the symbolic link.
<P>
<CODE>diff</CODE> should optionally report changes to special files specially,
and <CODE>patch</CODE> should be extended to understand these extensions.
