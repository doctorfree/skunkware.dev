<P>
Once you've extracted the tools from the tape, they are installed into a
directory named <TT>`<VAR>installdir</VAR>/progressive-95q4'</TT>.  We put the
release number in the directory name so that you can keep several
releases installed at the same time, if you wish.  In order to simplify
administrative procedures (such as upgrades to future Cygnus Support
Progressive releases), we recommend that you establish a symbolic link
<TT>`/usr/cygnus/progressive'</TT> to this directory.
<P>
<PRE>
ln -s <VAR>installdir</VAR>/progressive-95q4 <VAR>installdir</VAR>/progressive
</PRE>
<P>
For example, if you've installed in the default location under
<TT>`/usr/cygnus'</TT>:
<P>
<PRE>
ln -s /usr/cygnus/progressive-95q4 /usr/cygnus/progressive
</PRE>
<P>
Directories of <DFN>machine-independent</DFN> files (source code and
documentation) are installed directly under <TT>`progressive-95q4'</TT>.
However, to accomodate binaries for multiple hosts in a single directory
structure, the binary files for your particular host type are in a
subdirectory <TT>`H-<VAR>hosttype</VAR>'</TT>.  (<VAR>hosttype</VAR> indicates a
particular architecture, vendor and operating system.
See section <A HREF="install_33.html#SEC33">Platform names</A>.)
<P>
This means that one more level of symbolic links is helpful, to allow
your users to keep the same execution path defined even if they
sometimes use binaries for one machine and sometimes for another.  Even
if this doesn't apply now, you might want it in the future; establishing
these links now can save your users the trouble of changing all their
paths later.  The idea is to build <SAMP>`/usr/progressive/bin'</SAMP> on
each machine so that it points to the appropriate binary subdirectory
for each machine--for instance,
<SAMP>`/usr/cygnus/progressive/H-<VAR>hosttype</VAR>'</SAMP>.
<P>
You may need super-user access again briefly to establish this link:
<P>
<PRE>
ln -s /usr/cygnus/progressive/H-<VAR>hosttype</VAR> /usr/progressive
</PRE>
<P>
We recommend building these links as the last step in the installation
process.  That way, users at your site only see software in
<TT>`/usr/progressive'</TT> when you're satisfied that the installation is
complete and successful.
