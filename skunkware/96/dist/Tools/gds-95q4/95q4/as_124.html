<P>
This directive expects zero or more <VAR>expressions</VAR>, of any section,
separated by commas.
<P>
The size of the number emitted, and its byte order,
depend on what target computer the assembly is for.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>Warning: Special Treatment to support Compilers</EM>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Machines with a 32-bit address space, but that do less than 32-bit
addressing, require the following special treatment.  If the machine of
interest to you does 32-bit addressing (or doesn't require it;
see section <A HREF="as_126.html#SEC128">Machine Dependent Features</A>), you can ignore this issue.
<P>
In order to assemble compiler output into something that works,
<CODE>as</CODE> occasionlly does strange things to <SAMP>`.word'</SAMP> directives.
Directives of the form <SAMP>`.word sym1-sym2'</SAMP> are often emitted by
compilers as part of jump tables.  Therefore, when <CODE>as</CODE> assembles a
directive of the form <SAMP>`.word sym1-sym2'</SAMP>, and the difference between
<CODE>sym1</CODE> and <CODE>sym2</CODE> does not fit in 16 bits, <CODE>as</CODE>
creates a <DFN>secondary jump table</DFN>, immediately before the next label.
This secondary jump table is preceded by a short-jump to the
first byte after the secondary table.  This short-jump prevents the flow
of control from accidentally falling into the new table.  Inside the
table is a long-jump to <CODE>sym2</CODE>.  The original <SAMP>`.word'</SAMP>
contains <CODE>sym1</CODE> minus the address of the long-jump to
<CODE>sym2</CODE>.
<P>
If there were several occurrences of <SAMP>`.word sym1-sym2'</SAMP> before the
secondary jump table, all of them are adjusted.  If there was a
<SAMP>`.word sym3-sym4'</SAMP>, that also did not fit in sixteen bits, a
long-jump to <CODE>sym4</CODE> is included in the secondary jump table,
and the <CODE>.word</CODE> directives are adjusted to contain <CODE>sym3</CODE>
minus the address of the long-jump to <CODE>sym4</CODE>; and so on, for as many
entries in the original jump table as necessary.
