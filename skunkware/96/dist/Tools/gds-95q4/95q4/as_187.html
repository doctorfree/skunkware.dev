<H2><A NAME="SEC189" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC189">Motorola Syntax</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX589"></A>
<A NAME="IDX590"></A>
<P>
The standard Motorola syntax for this chip differs from the syntax
already discussed (see section <A HREF="as_186.html#SEC188">Syntax</A>).  <CODE>as</CODE> can
accept Motorola syntax for operands, even if MIT syntax is used for
other operands in the same instruction.  The two kinds of syntax are
fully compatible.
<P>
In the following table <VAR>apc</VAR> stands for any of the address registers
(<SAMP>`%a0'</SAMP> through <SAMP>`%a7'</SAMP>), the program counter (<SAMP>`%pc'</SAMP>), the
zero-address relative to the program counter (<SAMP>`%zpc'</SAMP>), or a
suppressed address register (<SAMP>`%za0'</SAMP> through <SAMP>`%za7'</SAMP>).  The use
of <VAR>size</VAR> means one of <SAMP>`w'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`l'</SAMP>, and it may always be
omitted along with the leading dot.  The use of <VAR>scale</VAR> means one of
<SAMP>`1'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`2'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`4'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`8'</SAMP>, and it may always be omitted
along with the leading asterisk.
<P>
The following additional addressing modes are understood:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DFN>Address Register Indirect</DFN>
<DD><SAMP>`(%a0)'</SAMP> through <SAMP>`(%a7)'</SAMP><BR> 
<SAMP>`%a7'</SAMP> is also known as <SAMP>`%sp'</SAMP>, i.e. the Stack Pointer.  <CODE>%a6</CODE>
is also known as <SAMP>`%fp'</SAMP>, the Frame Pointer.

<DT><DFN>Address Register Postincrement</DFN>
<DD><SAMP>`(%a0)+'</SAMP> through <SAMP>`(%a7)+'</SAMP>

<DT><DFN>Address Register Predecrement</DFN>
<DD><SAMP>`-(%a0)'</SAMP> through <SAMP>`-(%a7)'</SAMP>

<DT><DFN>Indirect Plus Offset</DFN>
<DD><SAMP>`<VAR>number</VAR>(<VAR>%a0</VAR>)'</SAMP> through <SAMP>`<VAR>number</VAR>(<VAR>%a7</VAR>)'</SAMP>,
or <SAMP>`<VAR>number</VAR>(<VAR>%pc</VAR>)'</SAMP>.

The <VAR>number</VAR> may also appear within the parentheses, as in
<SAMP>`(<VAR>number</VAR>,<VAR>%a0</VAR>)'</SAMP>.  When used with the <VAR>pc</VAR>, the
<VAR>number</VAR> may be omitted (with an address register, omitting the
<VAR>number</VAR> produces Address Register Indirect mode).

<DT><DFN>Index</DFN>
<DD><SAMP>`<VAR>number</VAR>(<VAR>apc</VAR>,<VAR>register</VAR>.<VAR>size</VAR>*<VAR>scale</VAR>)'</SAMP>

The <VAR>number</VAR> may be omitted, or it may appear within the
parentheses.  The <VAR>apc</VAR> may be omitted.  The <VAR>register</VAR> and the
<VAR>apc</VAR> may appear in either order.  If both <VAR>apc</VAR> and
<VAR>register</VAR> are address registers, and the <VAR>size</VAR> and <VAR>scale</VAR>
are omitted, then the first register is taken as the base register, and
the second as the index register.

<DT><DFN>Postindex</DFN>
<DD><SAMP>`([<VAR>number</VAR>,<VAR>apc</VAR>],<VAR>register</VAR>.<VAR>size</VAR>*<VAR>scale</VAR>,<VAR>onumber</VAR>)'</SAMP>

The <VAR>onumber</VAR>, or the <VAR>register</VAR>, or both, may be omitted.
Either the <VAR>number</VAR> or the <VAR>apc</VAR> may be omitted, but not both.

<DT><DFN>Preindex</DFN>
<DD><SAMP>`([<VAR>number</VAR>,<VAR>apc</VAR>,<VAR>register</VAR>.<VAR>size</VAR>*<VAR>scale</VAR>],<VAR>onumber</VAR>)'</SAMP>

The <VAR>number</VAR>, or the <VAR>apc</VAR>, or the <VAR>register</VAR>, or any two of
them, may be omitted.  The <VAR>onumber</VAR> may be omitted.  The
<VAR>register</VAR> and the <VAR>apc</VAR> may appear in either order.  If both
<VAR>apc</VAR> and <VAR>register</VAR> are address registers, and the <VAR>size</VAR>
and <VAR>scale</VAR> are omitted, then the first register is taken as the
base register, and the second as the index register.
