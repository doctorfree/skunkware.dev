<P>
To set a variable from the makefile, write a line starting with the
variable name followed by <SAMP>`='</SAMP> or <SAMP>`:='</SAMP>.  Whatever follows the
<SAMP>`='</SAMP> or <SAMP>`:='</SAMP> on the line becomes the value.  For example,
<P>
<PRE>
objects = main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o
</PRE>
<P>
defines a variable named <CODE>objects</CODE>.  Whitespace around the variable
name and immediately after the <SAMP>`='</SAMP> is ignored.
<P>
Variables defined with <SAMP>`='</SAMP> are <DFN>recursively expanded</DFN> variables.
Variables defined with <SAMP>`:='</SAMP> are <DFN>simply expanded</DFN> variables; these
definitions can contain variable references which will be expanded before
the definition is made.  See section <A HREF="make_58.html#SEC57">The Two Flavors of Variables</A>.
<P>
The variable name may contain function and variable references, which
are expanded when the line is read to find the actual variable name to use.
<P>
There is no limit on the length of the value of a variable except the
amount of swapping space on the computer.  When a variable definition is
long, it is a good idea to break it into several lines by inserting
backslash-newline at convenient places in the definition.  This will not
affect the functioning of <CODE>make</CODE>, but it will make the makefile easier
to read.
<P>
Most variable names are considered to have the empty string as a value if
you have never set them.  Several variables have built-in initial values
that are not empty, but you can set them in the usual ways
(see section <A HREF="make_90.html#SEC89">Variables Used by Implicit Rules</A>).  
Several special variables are set
automatically to a new value for each rule; these are called the
<DFN>automatic</DFN> variables (see section <A HREF="make_95.html#SEC94">Automatic Variables</A>).
