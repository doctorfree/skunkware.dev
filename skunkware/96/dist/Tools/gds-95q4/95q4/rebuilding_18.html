<P>
The installed distribution is easily updated via the symbolic link

</P>

<PRE>
ln -s /usr/cygnus/progressive-<VAR>release</VAR> /usr/cygnus/progressive
</PRE>

<P>
Each time you install a new <VAR>release</VAR> with a similar configuration,
you only need to change this symbolic link to give your users access to
the new version of the toolkit.  You can also revert the change by
switching the symbolic link back to the previous <VAR>release</VAR> if
needed, as the previous <VAR>release</VAR> is also still available.  Once you
decide to keep the new <VAR>release</VAR>, you can remove the old one to
conserve disk space.
