As a back end for GNU CC <CODE>as</CODE> has been throughly tested and should
work extremely well.  We have tested it only minimally on hand written assembly
code and no one has tested it much on the assembly output from the HP
compilers.
<P>
The format of the debugging sections has changed since the original
<CODE>as</CODE> port (version 1.3X) was released; therefore,
you must rebuild all HPPA objects and libraries with the new 
assembler so that you can debug the final executable.
<P>
The HPPA <CODE>as</CODE> port generates a small subset of the relocations
available in the SOM and ELF object file formats.  Additional relocation
support will be added as it becomes necessary.
