<P>
<CODE>as</CODE> should never give a warning or error message when
assembling compiler output.  But programs written by people often
cause <CODE>as</CODE> to give a warning that a particular assumption was
made.  All such warnings are directed to the standard error file.
If you use this option, no warnings are issued.  This option only
affects the warning messages: it does not change any particular of how
<CODE>as</CODE> assembles your file.  Errors, which stop the assembly, are
still reported.
