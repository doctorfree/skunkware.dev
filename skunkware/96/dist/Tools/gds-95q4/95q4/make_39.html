<H3><A NAME="SEC38" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC38">Syntax of Static Pattern Rules</A></H3>
<P>
Here is the syntax of a static pattern rule:
<P>
<PRE>
<VAR>targets</VAR> ...: <VAR>target-pattern</VAR>: <VAR>dep-patterns</VAR> ...
        <VAR>commands</VAR>
        ...
</PRE>
<P>
The <VAR>targets</VAR> list specifies the targets that the rule applies to.
The targets can contain wildcard characters, just like the targets of
ordinary rules (see section <A HREF="make_22.html#SEC21">Using Wildcard Characters in File Names</A>).
<A NAME="IDX202"></A>
<A NAME="IDX203"></A>
<P>
The <VAR>target-pattern</VAR> and <VAR>dep-patterns</VAR> say how to compute the
dependencies of each target.  Each target is matched against the
<VAR>target-pattern</VAR> to extract a part of the target name, called the
<DFN>stem</DFN>.  This stem is substituted into each of the <VAR>dep-patterns</VAR>
to make the dependency names (one from each <VAR>dep-pattern</VAR>).
<P>
Each pattern normally contains the character <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> just once.  When the
<VAR>target-pattern</VAR> matches a target, the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> can match any part of
the target name; this part is called the <DFN>stem</DFN>.  The rest of the
pattern must match exactly.  For example, the target <TT>`foo.o'</TT> matches
the pattern <SAMP>`%.o'</SAMP>, with <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> as the stem.  The targets
<TT>`foo.c'</TT> and <TT>`foo.out'</TT> do not match that pattern.<A NAME="IDX204"></A>
<P>
The dependency names for each target are made by substituting the stem
for the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> in each dependency pattern.  For example, if one
dependency pattern is <TT>`%.c'</TT>, then substitution of the stem
<SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> gives the dependency name <TT>`foo.c'</TT>.  It is legitimate
to write a dependency pattern that does not contain <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>; then this
dependency is the same for all targets.
<A NAME="IDX205"></A>
<A NAME="IDX206"></A>
<A NAME="IDX207"></A>
<A NAME="IDX208"></A>
<A NAME="IDX209"></A>
<P>
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> characters in pattern rules can be quoted with preceding
backslashes (<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>).  Backslashes that would otherwise quote <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>
characters can be quoted with more backslashes.  Backslashes that quote
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> characters or other backslashes are removed from the pattern
before it is compared to file names or has a stem substituted into it.
Backslashes that are not in danger of quoting <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> characters go
unmolested.  For example, the pattern <TT>`the\%weird\\%pattern\\'</TT> has
<SAMP>`the%weird\'</SAMP> preceding the operative <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> character, and
<SAMP>`pattern\\'</SAMP> following it.  The final two backslashes are left alone
because they cannot affect any <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> character.<P>
Here is an example, which compiles each of <TT>`foo.o'</TT> and <TT>`bar.o'</TT>
from the corresponding <TT>`.c'</TT> file:
<P>
<PRE>
objects = foo.o bar.o

$(objects): %.o: %.c
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $&#60; -o $@
</PRE>
<P>
Here <SAMP>`$&#60;'</SAMP> is the automatic variable that holds the name of the
dependency and <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP> is the automatic variable that holds the name
of the target; see section <A HREF="make_95.html#SEC94">Automatic Variables</A>.
<P>
Each target specified must match the target pattern; a warning is issued
for each target that does not.  If you have a list of files, only some of
which will match the pattern, you can use the <CODE>filter</CODE> function to
remove nonmatching file names (see section <A HREF="make_74.html#SEC73">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</A>):
<P>
<PRE>
files = foo.elc bar.o lose.o

$(filter %.o,$(files)): %.o: %.c
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $&#60; -o $@
$(filter %.elc,$(files)): %.elc: %.el
        emacs -f batch-byte-compile $&#60;
</PRE>
<P>
In this example the result of <SAMP>`$(filter %.o,$(files))'</SAMP> is
<TT>`bar.o lose.o'</TT>, and the first static pattern rule causes each of
these object files to be updated by compiling the corresponding C source
file.  The result of <SAMP>`$(filter %.elc,$(files))'</SAMP> is
<TT>`foo.elc'</TT>, so that file is made from <TT>`foo.el'</TT>.<P>
Another example shows how to use <CODE>$*</CODE> in static pattern rules:
<A NAME="IDX210"></A>
<P>
<PRE>
bigoutput littleoutput : %output : text.g
        generate text.g -$* &#62; $@
</PRE>
<P>
When the <CODE>generate</CODE> command is run, <CODE>$*</CODE> will expand to the
stem, either <SAMP>`big'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`little'</SAMP>.
