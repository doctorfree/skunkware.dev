<P>
A <DFN>label</DFN> is written as a symbol immediately followed by a colon
<SAMP>`:'</SAMP>.  The symbol then represents the current value of the
active location counter, and is, for example, a suitable instruction
operand.  You are warned if you use the same symbol to represent two
different locations: the first definition overrides any other
definitions.
<P>
On the HPPA, the usual form for a label need not be immediately followed by a
colon, but instead must start in column zero.  Only one label may be defined on
a single line.  To work around this, the HPPA version of <CODE>as</CODE> also
provides a special directive <CODE>.label</CODE> for defining labels more flexibly.
