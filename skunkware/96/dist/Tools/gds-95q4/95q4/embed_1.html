This document describes programming practices and options for several of
the embedded targets supported by the Cygnus Developer's Kit.  This
document is currently draft status, as the tools themselves are evolving
to meet the needs of our customers.  It is also incomplete, as new
targets are added to our matrix frequently
(see section `Overview' in <CITE>Release Notes</CITE>).
