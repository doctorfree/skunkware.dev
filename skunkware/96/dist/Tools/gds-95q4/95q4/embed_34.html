<H4><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="embed_toc.html#TOC34">Assembler options</A></H4>
<P>
You should use GNU <CODE>as</CODE> to assemble <CODE>GCC</CODE> output.  To 
ensure this, <CODE>GCC</CODE> should be configured using the 
<SAMP>`--with-gnu-as'</SAMP> switch (as it is in Cygnus distributions
).  Alternatively, you can invoke <CODE>GCC</CODE> with the <CODE>-mgas</CODE> 
option.
<P>
GNU <CODE>as</CODE> for MIPS architectures supports the MIPS R2000 and R3000
processors.
<P>
If you invoke <CODE>as</CODE> via the GNU C compiler (version 2), you can use
the <SAMP>`-Wa'</SAMP> option to pass arguments through to the assembler.  One
common use of this option is to exploit the assembler's listing
features.  Assembler arguments you specify with <CODE>gcc -Wa</CODE> must be
separated from each other (and the <SAMP>`-Wa'</SAMP>) by commas.  For example,
the <SAMP>`-alh'</SAMP> assembler option in the following commandline:
<P>
<PRE>
$ mips-idt-ecoff-gcc -c -g -O -Wa,-alh,-L file.c
</PRE>
<P>
requests a listing with high-level language and assembly language
interspersed.
<P>
The example also illustrates two other convenient options to specify
for assembler listings:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
The compiler debugging option <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> is essential to see interspersed
high-level source statements, since without debugging information the
assembler cannot tie most of the generated code to lines of the original
source file.

<LI>
The additional assembler option <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> preserves
local labels, which may make the listing output more intelligible to
humans.
</OL>
<P>
These are the options to enable listing output from the assembler.  By
itself, <SAMP>`-a'</SAMP> requests listings of high-level language source,
assembly language, and symbols.
<P>
You can use other letters to select specific options for the list:
<SAMP>`-ah'</SAMP> requests a high-level language listing, <SAMP>`-al'</SAMP> requests
an output-program assembly listing, and <SAMP>`-as'</SAMP> requests a symbol
table listing.  High-level listings require that a compiler debugging
option like <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> be used, and that assembly listings (<SAMP>`-al'</SAMP>)
be requested also.
<P>
You can use the <SAMP>`-ad'</SAMP> option to <EM>omit</EM> debugging directives
from the listing.
<P>
When you specify one of these options, you can further control listing
output and its appearance using these <DFN>listing-control</DFN> assembler
directives:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>.nolist</CODE>
<DD>Turn off listings from this point on.

<DT><CODE>.list</CODE>
<DD>Turn listings back on from here.

<DT><CODE>.psize <VAR>linecount</VAR> , <VAR>columnwidth</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Describe the page size for your output.  (Default 60, 200.)
The assembler generates form feeds after printing each group of
<VAR>linecount</VAR> lines.  To avoid these automatic form feeds, specify 0
as the <VAR>linecount</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>.eject</CODE>
<DD>Skip to a new page (issue a form feed).

<DT><CODE>.title</CODE>
<DD>Use <VAR>heading</VAR> as the title (second line, immediately after the
source file name and pagenumber).

<DT><CODE>.sbttl</CODE>
<DD>Use <VAR>subheading</VAR> as the subtitle (third line, immediately after the
title line) when generating assembly listings.
</DL>
<P>
If you do not request listing output with one of the <SAMP>`-a'</SAMP> options,
these listing-control directives have no effect.  You can also use the
<SAMP>`-an'</SAMP> option to turn off all forms processing.
<P>
The letters after <SAMP>`-a'</SAMP> may be combined into one option,
<EM>e.g.</EM>, <SAMP>`-aln'</SAMP>.
<P>
<H3>GAS options for MIPS</H3>
<P>
The MIPS configurations of GNU <CODE>as</CODE> support three special
options, and accept one other for command-line compatibility.
See section `Command-Line Options' in <CITE>Using the GNU Assembler as</CITE>, for information on the command-line options available with
all configurations of the GNU assembler.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-G <VAR>num</VAR></CODE>
<DD>This option sets the largest size of an object that will be referenced
implicitly with the <CODE>gp</CODE> register.  It is only accepted for targets
that use ECOFF format.  The default value is 8.

<DT><CODE>-EB</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-EL</CODE>
<DD>Any MIPS configuration of <CODE>as</CODE> can select big-endian or
little-endian output at run time (unlike the other GNU development
tools, which must be configured for one or the other).  Use <SAMP>`-EB'</SAMP>
to select big-endian output, and <SAMP>`-EL'</SAMP> for little-endian.

<DT><CODE>-nocpp</CODE>
<DD>This option is ignored.  It is accepted for command-line compatibility
with other assemblers, which use it to turn off C style preprocessing.
With GNU <CODE>as</CODE>, there is no need for <SAMP>`-nocpp'</SAMP>, because the
GNU assembler itself never runs the C preprocessor.  
</DL>
<P>
<H3>GAS directives for debugging information</H3>
<P>
MIPS ECOFF <CODE>as</CODE> supports several directives used for generating
debugging information which are not supported by traditional MIPS
assemblers.  These are <CODE>.def</CODE>, <CODE>.endef</CODE>, <CODE>.dim</CODE>,
<CODE>.file</CODE>, <CODE>.scl</CODE>, <CODE>.size</CODE>, <CODE>.tag</CODE>, <CODE>.type</CODE>,
<CODE>.val</CODE>, <CODE>.stabd</CODE>, <CODE>.stabn</CODE>, and <CODE>.stabs</CODE>.  The
debugging information generated by the three <CODE>.stab</CODE> directives can
only be read by GDB, not by traditional MIPS debuggers (this enhancement
is required to fully support C++ debugging).  These directives are
primarily used by compilers, not assembly language programmers!
See section `Assembler Directives' in <CITE>Using as</CITE>, for
full information on all GNU <CODE>as</CODE> directives.
