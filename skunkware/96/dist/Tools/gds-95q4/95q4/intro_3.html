<P>
You can browse through the online documentation using either GNU
Emacs or the documentation browser program <CODE>info</CODE> included in the
Developer's Kit distribution.  Online, the manuals are organized into
<DFN>nodes</DFN>, which correspond to the chapters and sections of a printed
book.  You can follow them in sequence, if you wish, just like in the
printed book--but there are also other choices.  The documents have
menus that let you go quickly to the node that has the information you
need.  <CODE>info</CODE> has "<DFN>hot</DFN>" references; if one section refers
to another, you can tell <CODE>info</CODE> to take you immediately to that
other section--and you can get back again easily to take up your
reading where you left off.  Naturally, you can also search for
particular words or phrases.
<P>
The best way to get started with the online documentation system is to
run the browser <CODE>info</CODE>.  After this Developer's Kit release is
installed on your system, you can get into <CODE>info</CODE> by just typing
its name--no options or arguments are necessary--at your shell's
prompt (shown as <SAMP>`eg%'</SAMP> here):

(You may need to check that <CODE>info</CODE> is in your shell path after you
install the Developer's Kit release. If you have problems running
<CODE>info</CODE>, please contact your systems administrator.)
<P>
To learn how to use <CODE>info</CODE>, type the command <SAMP>`h'</SAMP> for a
programmed instruction sequence, or <KBD><KBD>CTL</KBD>-h</KBD> for a short
summary of commands.  If at any time you are ready to stop using
<CODE>info</CODE>, type <SAMP>`q'</SAMP>.
<P>
See section `The Info Program' in <CITE>GNU Online Documentation</CITE>, for
detailed discussion of the <CODE>info</CODE> program.
