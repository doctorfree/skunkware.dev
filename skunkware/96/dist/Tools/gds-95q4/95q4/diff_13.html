<H3><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="diff_toc.html#TOC13">Detailed Description of Normal Format</A></H3>
<P>
The normal output format consists of one or more hunks of differences;
each hunk shows one area where the files differ.  Normal format hunks
look like this:
<P>
<PRE>
<VAR>change-command</VAR>
&#60; <VAR>from-file-line</VAR>
&#60; <VAR>from-file-line</VAR>...
---
&#62; <VAR>to-file-line</VAR>
&#62; <VAR>to-file-line</VAR>...
</PRE>
<P>
There are three types of change commands.  Each consists of a line
number or comma-separated range of lines in the first file, a single
character indicating the kind of change to make, and a line number or
comma-separated range of lines in the second file.  All line numbers are
the original line numbers in each file.  The types of change commands
are:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`<VAR>l</VAR>a<VAR>r</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>Add the lines in range <VAR>r</VAR> of the second file after line <VAR>l</VAR> of
the first file.  For example, <SAMP>`8a12,15'</SAMP> means append lines 12--15
of file 2 after line 8 of file 1; or, if changing file 2 into file 1,
delete lines 12--15 of file 2.

<DT><SAMP>`<VAR>f</VAR>c<VAR>t</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>Replace the lines in range <VAR>f</VAR> of the first file with lines in range
<VAR>t</VAR> of the second file.  This is like a combined add and delete, but
more compact.  For example, <SAMP>`5,7c8,10'</SAMP> means change lines 5--7 of
file 1 to read as lines 8--10 of file 2; or, if changing file 2 into
file 1, change lines 8--10 of file 2 to read as lines 5--7 of file 1.

<DT><SAMP>`<VAR>r</VAR>d<VAR>l</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>Delete the lines in range <VAR>r</VAR> from the first file; line <VAR>l</VAR> is where
they would have appeared in the second file had they not been deleted.
For example, <SAMP>`5,7d3'</SAMP> means delete lines 5--7 of file 1; or, if
changing file 2 into file 1, append lines 5--7 of file 1 after line 3 of
file 2.
