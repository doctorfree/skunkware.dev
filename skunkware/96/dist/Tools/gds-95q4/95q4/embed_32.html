<H4><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="embed_toc.html#TOC32">Compiler options</A></H4>
<P>
When you run <CODE>GCC</CODE>, you can use command-line options to choose
machine-specific details.  For information on all the <CODE>GCC</CODE> 
command-line options, see 
section `GNU CC Command Options' in <CITE>Using GNU CC</CITE>.
<P>
<H3>GCC options for architecture and code generation</H3>
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-mcpu=r3000</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mcpu=<VAR>cputype</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Since most IDT boards are based on the MIPS R3000, the
default for this particular configuration is <SAMP>`-mcpu=r3000'</SAMP>.

In the general case, use this option on any MIPS platform to assume
the defaults for the machine type <VAR>cputype</VAR> when scheduling
instructions.  The default <VAR>cputype</VAR> on other MIPS
configurations is <SAMP>`default'</SAMP>, which picks the longest cycle times
for any of the machines, in order that the code run at reasonable rates
on any MIPS CPU.  Other choices for <VAR>cputype</VAR> are
<SAMP>`r2000'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`r3000'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`r4000'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`r6000'</SAMP>.  While
picking a specific <VAR>cputype</VAR> will schedule things appropriately for
that particular chip, the compiler will not generate any code that does
not meet level 1 of the MIPS ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)
unless you use the <SAMP>`-mips2'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-mips3'</SAMP> switch.

<DT><CODE>-mgpopt</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-gpopt</CODE>
<DD>With <SAMP>`-mgpopt'</SAMP>, write all of the data declarations
before the instructions in the text section.  This allows the MIPS
assembler to generate one word memory references instead of using two
words for short global or static data items.  This is on by default when
you compile with optimization.

<DT><CODE>-mstats</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-stats</CODE>
<DD>With <SAMP>`-mstats'</SAMP>, for each non-inline function processed, emit one
line to the standard error file to print statistics about the program
(number of registers saved, stack size, etc.).

<DT><CODE>-mmemcpy</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-memcpy</CODE>
<DD>With <SAMP>`-mmemcpy'</SAMP>, make all block moves call <CODE>memcpy</CODE> (a C
library string function) instead of possibly generating inline code.

<DT><CODE>-mlong-calls</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-long-calls</CODE>
<DD>Do all calls with the <CODE>JALR</CODE> instruction, which requires loading up
a function's address into a register before the call.  You need this
switch if you call functions outside of the current 512 megabyte segment
(unless you use function pointers for the call).

<DT><CODE>-mhalf-pic</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-half-pic</CODE>
<DD>Put pointers to extern references into the data section and load them
up, rather than putting the references in the text section.

<DT><CODE>-G <VAR>num</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Put global and static items less than or equal to <VAR>num</VAR> bytes into
the small data or bss sections instead of the normal data or bss
section.  This allows the assembler to emit one word memory reference
instructions based on the global pointer (<VAR>gp</VAR> or <VAR>$28</VAR>),
instead of the normal two words used.  By default, <VAR>num</VAR> is 8.  When
you specify another value, <CODE>gcc</CODE> also passes the <SAMP>`-G
<VAR>num</VAR>'</SAMP> switch to the assembler and linker.
</DL>
<P>
<H3>GCC options for floating point</H3>
<P>
These options select software or hardware floating point.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-msoft-float</CODE>
<DD>Generate output containing library calls for floating point.  The
<SAMP>`mips-idt-ecoff'</SAMP> configuration of <TT>`libgcc'</TT> (an auxiliary
library distributed with the compiler) include a
collection of subroutines to implement these library calls.

In particular, this <CODE>GCC</CODE> configuration generates subroutine calls
compatible with the US Software "GOFAST R3000" floating point library,
giving you the opportunity to use either the <TT>`libgcc'</TT>
implementation or the US Software version.  IDT includes the GOFAST
library in their IDT C 5.0 package; you can also order libraries
separately from IDT as the "IDT KIT".  
of how to use <CODE>GCC</CODE> to link with the GOFAST library.

To use the <TT>`libgcc'</TT> version, you need nothing special; <CODE>GCC</CODE> 
links with <TT>`libgcc'</TT> automatically after all other object files and
libraries.

Because the calling convention on MIPS architectures depends on
whether or not hardware floating-point is installed, <SAMP>`-msoft-float'</SAMP>
has one further effect: <CODE>GCC</CODE> looks for subroutine libraries in a
subdirectory <SAMP>`soft-float'</SAMP>, for any library directory in your search
path.  (<EM>Note</EM>: This does not apply to directories specified using
the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option.)  With the Cygnus Developer's Kit, you can select
the standard libraries as usual with <SAMP>`-lc'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-lm'</SAMP>, because
the <SAMP>`soft-float'</SAMP> versions are installed in the default library
search paths.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>Warning:</EM> Treat <SAMP>`-msoft-float'</SAMP> as an "all or nothing"
proposition.  If you compile any module of a program with
<SAMP>`-msoft-float'</SAMP>, it's safest to compile all modules of the program
that way--and it's essential to use this option when you link.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<DT><CODE>-mhard-float</CODE>
<DD>Generate output containing floating point instructions, and use the
corresponding MIPS calling convention.  This is the default.
</DL>
<P>
<H3>Floating point subroutines</H3>
<P>
Two kinds of floating point subroutines are useful with <CODE>GCC</CODE>:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Software implementations of the basic functions (floating-point
multiply, divide, add, subtract), for use when there is no hardware
floating-point support.

When you indicate that no hardware floating point is available (with the
<CODE>GCC</CODE> option <SAMP>`-msoft-float'</SAMP>, <CODE>GCC</CODE> generates 
calls compatible with the US Software GOFAST library.  
If you do not have this library, you can still use software
floating point; <TT>`libgcc'</TT>, the auxiliary library distributed with
<CODE>GCC</CODE>, includes compatible--though slower--subroutines.

<LI>
General-purpose mathematical subroutines.

The Developer's Kit from Cygnus Support includes an implementation of
the standard C mathematical subroutine library.  See section `Mathematical Functions' in <CITE>The Cygnus C Math Library</CITE>.
</OL>
<P>
<H3>GCC options to avoid for  IDT R3000 boards</H3>
<P>
These options are meant for other forms of the MIPS architecture:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-mabicalls</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-abicalls</CODE>
<DD>Emit (or do not emit) the assembler directives <SAMP>`.abicalls'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`.cpload'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`.cprestore'</SAMP> that some System V.4 ports use for
position independent code.

<DT><CODE>-mips2</CODE>
<DD>Issue instructions from level 2 of the MIPS ISA (branch likely, square
root instructions).

<DT><CODE>-mmips-as</CODE>
<DD>Generate code for the MIPS assembler.  This is the default for many
other MIPS platforms, but it requires an auxiliary program
<CODE>mips-tfile</CODE> to encapsulate debugging information.

<CODE>mips-tfile</CODE> <EM>is not included</EM> in your Cygnus Developer's Kit,
since it is not required for the GNU assembler.

<DT><CODE>-mrnames</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-rnames</CODE>
<DD>Generate code using the MIPS software names for the registers,
instead of the hardware names (for example, <VAR>a0</VAR> instead of
<VAR>$4</VAR>).  The converse <SAMP>`-mno-rnames'</SAMP> switch is the default.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>Warning:</EM> The GNU assembler will not build code generated with the
<SAMP>`-mrnames'</SAMP> switch.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL>
<P>
These options are harmless--but unnecessary--on the R3000:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-mfp32</CODE>
<DD>Assume that there are 32 32-bit floating point registers.  This is the
default.

<DT><CODE>-mgas</CODE>
<DD>Generate code for the GNU assembler.  This is the default when <CODE>GCC</CODE> is
correctly configured for this platform, using the <SAMP>`-with-gnu-as'</SAMP>
configuration parameter.

<DT><CODE>-mno-mips-tfile</CODE>
<DD>The <SAMP>`-mno-mips-tfile'</SAMP> option prevents postprocessing the object
file with the <CODE>mips-tfile</CODE> program, after the MIPS assembler has
generated it to add debug support.  The GNU assembler does not require
<CODE>mips-tfile</CODE> in any case.

<CODE>mips-tfile</CODE> <EM>is not included</EM> in your Cygnus Developer's Kit.

<DT><CODE>-nocpp</CODE>
<DD>Tell the MIPS assembler to avoid running the C preprocessor over user
assembler files (with a <SAMP>`.s'</SAMP> suffix) when assembling them.
The GNU assembler never runs the C preprocessor in any case.

</DL>
<P>
Avoid these options--although they appear in the configuration
files, their implementation is not yet complete.
