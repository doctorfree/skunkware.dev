<A NAME="IDX75"></A>
<P>
One common case of nested conditionals is used to check for more than two
possible alternatives.  For example, you might have
<P>
<PRE>
#if X == 1
...
#else /* X != 1 */
#if X == 2
...
#else /* X != 2 */
...
#endif /* X != 2 */
#endif /* X != 1 */
</PRE>
<P>
Another conditional directive, <SAMP>`#elif'</SAMP>, allows this to be abbreviated
as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
#if X == 1
...
#elif X == 2
...
#else /* X != 2 and X != 1*/
...
#endif /* X != 2 and X != 1*/
</PRE>
<P>
<SAMP>`#elif'</SAMP> stands for "else if".  Like <SAMP>`#else'</SAMP>, it goes in the
middle of a <SAMP>`#if'</SAMP>-<SAMP>`#endif'</SAMP> pair and subdivides it; it does not
require a matching <SAMP>`#endif'</SAMP> of its own.  Like <SAMP>`#if'</SAMP>, the
<SAMP>`#elif'</SAMP> directive includes an expression to be tested.
<P>
The text following the <SAMP>`#elif'</SAMP> is processed only if the original
<SAMP>`#if'</SAMP>-condition failed and the <SAMP>`#elif'</SAMP> condition succeeds.
More than one <SAMP>`#elif'</SAMP> can go in the same <SAMP>`#if'</SAMP>-<SAMP>`#endif'</SAMP>
group.  Then the text after each <SAMP>`#elif'</SAMP> is processed only if the
<SAMP>`#elif'</SAMP> condition succeeds after the original <SAMP>`#if'</SAMP> and any
previous <SAMP>`#elif'</SAMP> directives within it have failed.  <SAMP>`#else'</SAMP> is
equivalent to <SAMP>`#elif 1'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`#else'</SAMP> is allowed after any
number of <SAMP>`#elif'</SAMP> directives, but <SAMP>`#elif'</SAMP> may not follow
<SAMP>`#else'</SAMP>.
