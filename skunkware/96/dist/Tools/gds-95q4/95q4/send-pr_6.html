<H3>Field descriptions</H3>
<P>
The following fields are present whenever a PR is submitted via the
program <CODE>send-pr</CODE>.  PRMS adds additional fields when the PR
arrives at the Support Site; explanations of these follow this list.
<A NAME="IDX38"></A>
<A NAME="IDX39"></A>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX40"></A>
<A NAME="IDX41"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>&#62;Submitter-Id:</CODE>
<DD>(TEXT) A unique identification code assigned by the Support Site.
It is used to identify all Problem Reports coming from a particular
site.  (Submitters without a value for this field can invoke
<CODE>send-pr</CODE> with the <SAMP>`--request-id'</SAMP> option to apply for one from
the support organization.  Problem Reports from those not affiliated
with the support organization should use the default value of <SAMP>`net'</SAMP>
for this field.)

<A NAME="IDX43"></A>
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>
<DT><CODE>&#62;Originator:</CODE>
<DD>(TEXT) Originator's real name.  The default is the value of the
originator's environment variable <CODE>NAME</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX45"></A>
<A NAME="IDX44"></A>
<DT><CODE>&#62;Organization:</CODE>
<DD>(MULTITEXT) The originator's organization.  The default value is 
set with the variable <CODE>DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION</CODE> in the

<A NAME="IDX48"></A>
<A NAME="IDX49"></A>
<A NAME="IDX46"></A>
<DT><CODE>&#62;Confidential:</CODE>
<DD>(ENUMERATED) Use of this field depends on the originator's
relationship with the support organization; contractual agreements often
have provisions for preserving confidentiality.  Conversely, a lack of a
contract often means that any data provided will not be considered
confidential.  Submitters should be advised to contact the support
organization directly if this is an issue.

If the originator's relationship to the support organization provides
for confidentiality, then if the value of this field is <SAMP>`yes'</SAMP> the
support organization treats the PR as confidential; any code samples
provided are not made publicly available (e.g., in regression test
suites).  The default value is <SAMP>`yes'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX51"></A>
<A NAME="IDX50"></A>
<DT><CODE>&#62;Synopsis:</CODE>

Report.

<A NAME="IDX55"></A>
<DT><CODE>serious</CODE>
<DD>The product, component or concept is not working properly or significant
functionality is missing.  Problems that would otherwise be considered

preconditions, inputs, outputs, conditions after the problem, and
symptoms.  Any additional important information should be included.
Include all the details that would be necessary for someone else to
recreate the problem reported, however obvious.  Sometimes seemingly
arbitrary or obvious information can point the way toward a solution.
