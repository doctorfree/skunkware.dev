<P>
Roughly, a section is a range of addresses, with no gaps; all data
"in" those addresses is treated the same for some particular purpose.
For example there may be a "read only" section.
<A NAME="IDX158"></A>
<A NAME="IDX159"></A>
<P>
The linker <CODE>ld</CODE> reads many object files (partial programs) and
combines their contents to form a runnable program.  When <CODE>as</CODE>
emits an object file, the partial program is assumed to start at address 0.
<CODE>ld</CODE> assigns the final addresses for the partial program, so that
different partial programs do not overlap.  This is actually an
oversimplification, but it suffices to explain how <CODE>as</CODE> uses
sections.
<P>
<CODE>ld</CODE> moves blocks of bytes of your program to their run-time
addresses.  These blocks slide to their run-time addresses as rigid
units; their length does not change and neither does the order of bytes
within them.  Such a rigid unit is called a <EM>section</EM>.  Assigning
run-time addresses to sections is called <DFN>relocation</DFN>.  It includes
the task of adjusting mentions of object-file addresses so they refer to
the proper run-time addresses.
For the H8/300 and H8/500,
and for the Hitachi SH,
<CODE>as</CODE> pads sections if needed to
ensure they end on a word (sixteen bit) boundary.
<A NAME="IDX160"></A>
<P>
An object file written by <CODE>as</CODE> has at least three sections, any
of which may be empty.  These are named <DFN>text</DFN>, <DFN>data</DFN> and
<DFN>bss</DFN> sections.
<P>
When it generates COFF output,
<CODE>as</CODE> can also generate whatever other named sections you specify
using the <SAMP>`.section'</SAMP> directive (see section <A HREF="as_111.html#SEC113"><CODE>.section <VAR>name</CODE>, <VAR>subsection</VAR></VAR></A>).
If you do not use any directives that place output in the <SAMP>`.text'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`.data'</SAMP> sections, these sections still exist, but are empty.
<P>
When <CODE>as</CODE> generates SOM or ELF output for the HPPA,
<CODE>as</CODE> can also generate whatever other named sections you
specify using the <SAMP>`.space'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`.subspace'</SAMP> directives.  See
<CITE>HP9000 Series 800 Assembly Language Reference Manual</CITE>
(HP 92432-90001) for details on the <SAMP>`.space'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`.subspace'</SAMP>
assembler directives.
<P>
Additionally, <CODE>as</CODE> uses different names for the standard
text, data, and bss sections when generating SOM output.  Program text
is placed into the <SAMP>`$CODE$'</SAMP> section, data into <SAMP>`$DATA$'</SAMP>, and
BSS into <SAMP>`$BSS$'</SAMP>.
<P>
Within the object file, the text section starts at address <CODE>0</CODE>, the
data section follows, and the bss section follows the data section.
<P>
When generating either SOM or ELF output files on the HPPA, the text
section starts at address <CODE>0</CODE>, the data section at address
<CODE>0x4000000</CODE>, and the bss section follows the data section.
<P>
To let <CODE>ld</CODE> know which data changes when the sections are
relocated, and how to change that data, <CODE>as</CODE> also writes to the
object file details of the relocation needed.  To perform relocation
<CODE>ld</CODE> must know, each time an address in the object
file is mentioned:
<UL>
<LI>
Where in the object file is the beginning of this reference to
an address?
<LI>
How long (in bytes) is this reference?
<LI>
Which section does the address refer to?  What is the numeric value of
<PRE>
(<VAR>address</VAR>) - (<VAR>start-address of section</VAR>)?
</PRE>
<LI>
Is the reference to an address "Program-Counter relative"?
</UL>
<A NAME="IDX161"></A>
<A NAME="IDX162"></A>
<P>
In fact, every address <CODE>as</CODE> ever uses is expressed as
<PRE>
(<VAR>section</VAR>) + (<VAR>offset into section</VAR>)
</PRE>
Further, most expressions <CODE>as</CODE> computes have this section-relative
nature.
(For some object formats, such as SOM for the HPPA, some expressions are
symbol-relative instead.)
<P>
In this manual we use the notation {<VAR>secname</VAR> <VAR>N</VAR>} to mean "offset
<VAR>N</VAR> into section <VAR>secname</VAR>."
<P>
Apart from text, data and bss sections you need to know about the
<DFN>absolute</DFN> section.  When <CODE>ld</CODE> mixes partial programs,
addresses in the absolute section remain unchanged.  For example, address
<CODE>{absolute 0}</CODE> is "relocated" to run-time address 0 by
<CODE>ld</CODE>.  Although the linker never arranges two partial programs'
data sections with overlapping addresses after linking, <EM>by definition</EM>
their absolute sections must overlap.  Address <CODE>{absolute 239}</CODE> in one
part of a program is always the same address when the program is running as
address <CODE>{absolute 239}</CODE> in any other part of the program.
<P>
The idea of sections is extended to the <DFN>undefined</DFN> section.  Any
address whose section is unknown at assembly time is by definition
rendered {undefined <VAR>U</VAR>}---where <VAR>U</VAR> is filled in later.
Since numbers are always defined, the only way to generate an undefined
address is to mention an undefined symbol.  A reference to a named
common block would be such a symbol: its value is unknown at assembly
time so it has section <EM>undefined</EM>.
<P>
By analogy the word <EM>section</EM> is used to describe groups of sections in
the linked program.  <CODE>ld</CODE> puts all partial programs' text
sections in contiguous addresses in the linked program.  It is
customary to refer to the <EM>text section</EM> of a program, meaning all
the addresses of all partial programs' text sections.  Likewise for
data and bss sections.
<P>
Some sections are manipulated by <CODE>ld</CODE>; others are invented for
use of <CODE>as</CODE> and have no meaning except during assembly.
