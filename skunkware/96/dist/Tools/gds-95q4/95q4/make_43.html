<P>
The commands of a rule consist of shell command lines to be executed one
by one.  Each command line must start with a tab, except that the first
command line may be attached to the target-and-dependencies line with a
semicolon in between.  Blank lines and lines of just comments may appear
among the command lines; they are ignored.  (But beware, an apparently
"blank" line that begins with a tab is <EM>not</EM> blank!  It is an
empty command; see section <A HREF="make_55.html#SEC54">Using Empty Commands</A>.)
<P>
Users use many different shell programs, but commands in makefiles are
always interpreted by <TT>`/bin/sh'</TT> unless the makefile specifies
otherwise.  See section <A HREF="make_45.html#SEC44">Command Execution</A>.

<A NAME="IDX231"></A>
<A NAME="IDX232"></A>
<P>
The shell that is in use determines whether comments can be written on
command lines, and what syntax they use.  When the shell is
<TT>`/bin/sh'</TT>, a <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> starts a comment that extends to the end of
the line.  The <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> does not have to be at the beginning of a line.
Text on a line before a <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> is not part of the comment.
