<P>
Normally, <CODE>patch</CODE> renames an original input file into a backup file
by appending to its name the extension <SAMP>`.orig'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`~'</SAMP> on
systems that do not support long file names.  The <SAMP>`-b
<VAR>backup-suffix</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--suffix=<VAR>backup-suffix</VAR>'</SAMP> option uses
<VAR>backup-suffix</VAR> as the backup extension instead.
<P>
Alternately, you can specify the extension for backup files with the
<CODE>SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX</CODE> environment variable, which the options
override.
<P>
<CODE>patch</CODE> can also create numbered backup files the way GNU Emacs
does.  With this method, instead of having a single backup of each file,
<CODE>patch</CODE> makes a new backup file name each time it patches a file.
For example, the backups of a file named <TT>`sink'</TT> would be called,
successively, <TT>`sink.~1~'</TT>, <TT>`sink.~2~'</TT>, <TT>`sink.~3~'</TT>, etc.
<P>
The <SAMP>`-V <VAR>backup-style</VAR>'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--version-control=<VAR>backup-style</VAR>'</SAMP> option takes as an argument
a method for creating backup file names.  You can alternately control
the type of backups that <CODE>patch</CODE> makes with the
<CODE>VERSION_CONTROL</CODE> environment variable, which the <SAMP>`-V'</SAMP> option
overrides.  The value of the <CODE>VERSION_CONTROL</CODE> environment variable
and the argument to the <SAMP>`-V'</SAMP> option are like the GNU Emacs
<CODE>version-control</CODE> variable (see section <A HREF="diff_78.html#SEC78">Backup File Names</A>, for more information on backup versions in
Emacs).  They also recognize synonyms that are more descriptive.  The
valid values are listed below; unique abbreviations are acceptable.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`t'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`numbered'</SAMP>
<DD>Always make numbered backups.

<DT><SAMP>`nil'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`existing'</SAMP>
<DD>Make numbered backups of files that already have them, simple backups of
the others.  This is the default.

<DT><SAMP>`never'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`simple'</SAMP>
<DD>Always make simple backups.
</DL>
<P>
Alternately, you can tell <CODE>patch</CODE> to prepend a prefix, such as a
directory name, to produce backup file names.  The <SAMP>`-B
<VAR>backup-prefix</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--prefix=<VAR>backup-prefix</VAR>'</SAMP> option makes
backup files by prepending <VAR>backup-prefix</VAR> to them.  If you use this
option, <CODE>patch</CODE> ignores any <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> option that you give.
<P>
If the backup file already exists, <CODE>patch</CODE> creates a new backup
file name by changing the first lowercase letter in the last component
of the file name into uppercase.  If there are no more lowercase letters
in the name, it removes the first character from the name.  It repeats
this process until it comes up with a backup file name that does not
already exist.
<P>
If you specify the output file with the <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> option, that file is
the one that is backed up, not the input file.
