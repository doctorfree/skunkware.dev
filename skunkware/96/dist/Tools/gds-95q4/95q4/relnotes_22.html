<P>
The Cygnus Developer's Kit is only supported on MS-DOS 6.2 or higher.
<P>
We do not recommend using the cross-development kit with less than four
(4) megabytes of RAM.
<P>
We provide a MS-DOS extender with the cross-development kit for
MS-DOS which does swapping to disk when MS-DOS runs out of
memory.  To avoid excessive swapping you must have at least two (2)
megabytes of RAM to run G++ on a PC with MS-DOS.  If you've
got more than two megabytes, the extra memory can be used as a disk
cache to significantly improve performance.
