<H3><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC29">Directory Search and Implicit Rules</A></H3>
<P>
The search through the directories specified in <CODE>VPATH</CODE> or with
<CODE>vpath</CODE> also happens during consideration of implicit rules
(see section <A HREF="make_87.html#SEC86">Using Implicit Rules</A>).
<P>
For example, when a file <TT>`foo.o'</TT> has no explicit rule, <CODE>make</CODE>
considers implicit rules, such as the built-in rule to compile
<TT>`foo.c'</TT> if that file exists.  If such a file is lacking in the
current directory, the appropriate directories are searched for it.  If
<TT>`foo.c'</TT> exists (or is mentioned in the makefile) in any of the
directories, the implicit rule for C compilation is applied.
<P>
The commands of implicit rules normally use automatic variables as a
matter of necessity; consequently they will use the file names found by
directory search with no extra effort.
