<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
<P>
This manual is intended to describe what you need to know to use
GNU <CODE>as</CODE>.  We cover the syntax expected in source files, including
notation for symbols, constants, and expressions; the directives that
<CODE>as</CODE> understands; and of course how to invoke <CODE>as</CODE>.
<P>
This manual also describes some of the machine-dependent features of
various flavors of the assembler.
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
<P>
On the other hand, this manual is <EM>not</EM> intended as an introduction
to programming in assembly language--let alone programming in general!
In a similar vein, we make no attempt to introduce the machine
architecture; we do <EM>not</EM> describe the instruction set, standard
mnemonics, registers or addressing modes that are standard to a
particular architecture.
You may want to consult the manufacturer's
machine architecture manual for this information.
