<H1><A NAME="SEC49" HREF="relnotes_toc.html#TOC49">Graphical User Interface for GDB</A></H1>
<P>
GDB in this release is configured to use the new Graphical User
Interface..  This interface is currently in a beta stage of development.
<P>
Under Unix, the GUI is called simply with <CODE>gdb</CODE>.  The GUI is
based on Tcl and the Tk windowing toolkit; a different system was used
to develop the GUI under Windows (available soon), but the underlying
structure is the same.
<P>
When running as a Unix program and using the X11-based interface, you
must of course be using an X server and/or workstation, and your
<CODE>DISPLAY</CODE> environment variable must be set correctly.  If either of
these is not true, then GDB still starts up, using the traditional
command interface.
<P>
The exact layout and appearance of the windows depends upon the host
system type.  General behavior and layout is consistent across all
platforms; omissions or restrictions on particular platforms, if not
documented as unavoidable, should be considered bugs and reported.
<P>
All GDB windows have a common structure.  Each window has an
associated menu bar, which may be at the top of the window or perhaps
elsewhere.  Some of the menus and menu items in the menu bar are common
to all GDB windows, while others are specific to particular types
of windows.  Below the menu bar is the working data area of the window.
If the data is too large to display all at once, the data area shows
scroll bars on its right and bottom sides.  Below the data area are two
optional features: a status/data line, and a button box.
<P>
For details on using GDB, see section `GDB Commands' in <CITE>Debugging With GDB</CITE>.
