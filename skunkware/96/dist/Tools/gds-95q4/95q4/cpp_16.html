<DFN>Concatenation</DFN> means joining two strings into one.  In the context
of macro expansion, concatenation refers to joining two lexical units
into one longer one.  Specifically, an actual argument to the macro can be
concatenated with another actual argument or with fixed text to produce
a longer name.  The longer name might be the name of a function,
variable or type, or a C keyword; it might even be the name of another
macro, in which case it will be expanded.
<P>
When you define a macro, you request concatenation with the special
operator <SAMP>`##'</SAMP> in the macro body.  When the macro is called,
after actual arguments are substituted, all <SAMP>`##'</SAMP> operators are
deleted, and so is any whitespace next to them (including whitespace
that was part of an actual argument).  The result is to concatenate
the syntactic tokens on either side of the <SAMP>`##'</SAMP>.
<P>
Consider a C program that interprets named commands.  There probably needs
to be a table of commands, perhaps an array of structures declared as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>
struct command
{
  char *name;
  void (*function) ();
};

struct command commands[] =
{
  { "quit", quit_command},
  { "help", help_command},
  ...
};
</PRE>
<P>
It would be cleaner not to have to give each command name twice, once in
the string constant and once in the function name.  A macro which takes the
name of a command as an argument can make this unnecessary.  The string
constant can be created with stringification, and the function name by
concatenating the argument with <SAMP>`_command'</SAMP>.  Here is how it is done:
<P>
<PRE>
#define COMMAND(NAME)  { #NAME, NAME ## _command }

struct command commands[] =
{
  COMMAND (quit),
  COMMAND (help),
  ...
};
</PRE>
<P>
The usual case of concatenation is concatenating two names (or a name and a
number) into a longer name.  But this isn't the only valid case.  It is
also possible to concatenate two numbers (or a number and a name, such as
<SAMP>`1.5'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`e3'</SAMP>) into a number.  Also, multi-character operators
such as <SAMP>`+='</SAMP> can be formed by concatenation.  In some cases it is even
possible to piece together a string constant.  However, two pieces of text
that don't together form a valid lexical unit cannot be concatenated.  For
example, concatenation with <SAMP>`x'</SAMP> on one side and <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> on the other
is not meaningful because those two characters can't fit together in any
lexical unit of C.  The ANSI standard says that such attempts at
concatenation are undefined, but in the GNU C preprocessor it is well
defined: it puts the <SAMP>`x'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> side by side with no particular
special results.
<P>
Keep in mind that the C preprocessor converts comments to whitespace before
macros are even considered.  Therefore, you cannot create a comment by
concatenating <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>: the <SAMP>`/*'</SAMP> sequence that starts a
comment is not a lexical unit, but rather the beginning of a "long" space
character.  Also, you can freely use comments next to a <SAMP>`##'</SAMP> in a
macro definition, or in actual arguments that will be concatenated, because
the comments will be converted to spaces at first sight, and concatenation
will later discard the spaces.
