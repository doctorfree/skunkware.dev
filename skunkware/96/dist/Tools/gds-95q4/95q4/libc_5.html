<STRONG>Synopsis</STRONG>
<PRE>
#include &#60;stdlib.h&#62;
int atexit(void (*<VAR>function</VAR>)(void);
    
    @end example
<STRONG>Description</STRONG><BR>
You can use <CODE>atexit</CODE> to enroll functions in a list of functions that
will be called when your program terminates normally.  The argument is
a pointer to a user-defined function (which must not require arguments and
must not return a result).

The functions are kept in a LIFO stack; that is, the last function
enrolled by <CODE>atexit</CODE> will be the first to execute when your program
exits.

There is no built-in limit to the number of functions you can enroll
in this list; however, after every group of 32 functions is enrolled,
<CODE>atexit</CODE> will call <CODE>malloc</CODE> to get space for the next part of the
list.   The initial list of 32 functions is statically allocated, so
you can always count on at least that many slots available.

<BR>
<STRONG>Returns</STRONG><BR>
<CODE>atexit</CODE> returns <CODE>0</CODE> if it succeeds in enrolling your function,
<CODE>-1</CODE> if it fails (possible only if no space was available for
<CODE>malloc</CODE> to extend the list of functions).

<BR>
<STRONG>Portability</STRONG><BR>
<CODE>atexit</CODE> is required by the ANSI standard, which also specifies that
implementations must support enrolling at least 32 functions.

Supporting OS subroutines required: <CODE>close</CODE>, <CODE>fstat</CODE>, <CODE>isatty</CODE>,
<CODE>lseek</CODE>, <CODE>read</CODE>, <CODE>sbrk</CODE>, <CODE>write</CODE>.
