<H2><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC32">Rules without Commands or Dependencies</A></H2>
<P>
If a rule has no dependencies or commands, and the target of the rule
is a nonexistent file, then <CODE>make</CODE> imagines this target to have
been updated whenever its rule is run.  This implies that all targets
depending on this one will always have their commands run.
<P>
An example will illustrate this:
<P>
<PRE>
clean: FORCE
        rm $(objects)
FORCE:
</PRE>
<P>
Here the target <SAMP>`FORCE'</SAMP> satisfies the special conditions, so the
target <TT>`clean'</TT> that depends on it is forced to run its commands.
There is nothing special about the name <SAMP>`FORCE'</SAMP>, but that is one name
commonly used this way.
<P>
As you can see, using <SAMP>`FORCE'</SAMP> this way has the same results as using
<SAMP>`.PHONY: clean'</SAMP>.  
<P>
Using <SAMP>`.PHONY'</SAMP> is more explicit and more efficient.  However,
other versions of <CODE>make</CODE> do not support <SAMP>`.PHONY'</SAMP>; thus
<SAMP>`FORCE'</SAMP> appears in many makefiles.  See section <A HREF="make_32.html#SEC31">Phony Targets</A>.
