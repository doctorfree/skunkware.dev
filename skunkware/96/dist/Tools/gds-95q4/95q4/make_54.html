<H2><A NAME="SEC53" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC53">Defining Canned Command Sequences</A></H2>
<P>
When the same sequence of commands is useful in making various targets, you
can define it as a canned sequence with the <CODE>define</CODE> directive, and
refer to the canned sequence from the rules for those targets.  The canned
sequence is actually a variable, so the name must not conflict with other
variable names.
<P>
Here is an example of defining a canned sequence of commands:
<P>
<PRE>
define run-yacc
yacc $(firstword $^)
mv y.tab.c $@
endef
<A NAME="IDX368"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
Here <CODE>run-yacc</CODE> is the name of the variable being defined;
<CODE>endef</CODE> marks the end of the definition; the lines in between are the
commands.  The <CODE>define</CODE> directive does not expand variable references
and function calls in the canned sequence; the <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> characters,
parentheses, variable names, and so on, all become part of the value of the
variable you are defining.
See section <A HREF="make_66.html#SEC65">Defining Variables Verbatim</A>,
for a complete explanation of <CODE>define</CODE>.
<P>
The first command in this example runs Yacc on the first dependency of
whichever rule uses the canned sequence.  The output file from Yacc is
always named <TT>`y.tab.c'</TT>.  The second command moves the output to the
rule's target file name.
<P>
To use the canned sequence, substitute the variable into the commands of a
rule.  You can substitute it like any other variable 
(see section <A HREF="make_57.html#SEC56">Basics of Variable References</A>).
Because variables defined by <CODE>define</CODE> are recursively expanded
variables, all the variable references you wrote inside the <CODE>define</CODE>
are expanded now.  For example:
<P>
<PRE>
foo.c : foo.y
        $(run-yacc)
</PRE>
<P>
<SAMP>`foo.y'</SAMP> will be substituted for the variable <SAMP>`$^'</SAMP> when it occurs in
<CODE>run-yacc</CODE>'s value, and <SAMP>`foo.c'</SAMP> for <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP>.<P>
This is a realistic example, but this particular one is not needed in
practice because <CODE>make</CODE> has an implicit rule to figure out these
commands based on the file names involved 
(see section <A HREF="make_87.html#SEC86">Using Implicit Rules</A>).
<A NAME="IDX369"></A>
<A NAME="IDX370"></A>
<A NAME="IDX371"></A>
<P>
In command execution, each line of a canned sequence is treated just as
if the line appeared on its own in the rule, preceded by a tab.  In
particular, <CODE>make</CODE> invokes a separate subshell for each line.  You
can use the special prefix characters that affect command lines
(<SAMP>`@'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>) on each line of a canned sequence.
See section <A HREF="make_43.html#SEC42">Writing the Commands in Rules</A>.
For example, using this canned sequence:
<P>
<PRE>
define frobnicate
@echo "frobnicating target $@"
frob-step-1 $&#60; -o $@-step-1
frob-step-2 $@-step-1 -o $@
endef
</PRE>
<P>
<CODE>make</CODE> will not echo the first line, the <CODE>echo</CODE> command.
But it <EM>will</EM> echo the following two command lines.
<P>
On the other hand, prefix characters on the command line that refers to
a canned sequence apply to every line in the sequence.  So the rule:
<P>
<PRE>
frob.out: frob.in
	@$(frobnicate)
</PRE>
<P>
does not echo <EM>any</EM> commands.
(See section <A HREF="make_44.html#SEC43">Command Echoing</A>, for a full explanation of <SAMP>`@'</SAMP>.)
