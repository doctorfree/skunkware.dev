<H2><A NAME="SEC134" HREF="usegcc_toc.html#TOC134">Where to Report Bugs</A></H2>
Send bug reports for GNU C to <SAMP>`bug-gcc@prep.ai.mit.edu'</SAMP>.
<A NAME="IDX558"></A>
<A NAME="IDX559"></A>
<P>
Send bug reports for GNU C++ to <SAMP>`bug-g++@prep.ai.mit.edu'</SAMP>.
If your bug involves the C++ class library libg++, send mail to
<SAMP>`bug-lib-g++@prep.ai.mit.edu'</SAMP>.  If you're not sure, you can send
the bug report to both lists.
<P>
<STRONG>Do not send bug reports to <SAMP>`help-gcc@prep.ai.mit.edu'</SAMP> or
to the newsgroup <SAMP>`gnu.gcc.help'</SAMP>.</STRONG> Most users of GNU CC do not want
to receive bug reports.  Those that do, have asked to be on
<SAMP>`bug-gcc'</SAMP> and/or <SAMP>`bug-g++'</SAMP>.
<P>
The mailing lists <SAMP>`bug-gcc'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`bug-g++'</SAMP> both have newsgroups
which serve as repeaters: <SAMP>`gnu.gcc.bug'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`gnu.g++.bug'</SAMP>.
Each mailing list and its newsgroup carry exactly the same messages.
<P>
Often people think of posting bug reports to the newsgroup instead of
mailing them.  This appears to work, but it has one problem which can be
crucial: a newsgroup posting does not contain a mail path back to the
sender.  Thus, if maintainers need more information, they may be unable
to reach you.  For this reason, you should always send bug reports by
mail to the proper mailing list.
<P>
As a last resort, send bug reports on paper to:
