<H2><A NAME="SEC76" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC76">The <CODE>origin</CODE> Function</A></H2>
<P>
The <CODE>origin</CODE> function is unlike most other functions in that it does
not operate on the values of variables; it tells you something <EM>about</EM>
a variable.  Specifically, it tells you where it came from.
<P>
The syntax of the <CODE>origin</CODE> function is:
<P>
<PRE>
$(origin <VAR>variable</VAR>)
</PRE>
<P>
Note that <VAR>variable</VAR> is the <EM>name</EM> of a variable to inquire about;
not a <EM>reference</EM> to that variable.  Therefore you would not normally
use a <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> or parentheses when writing it.  (You can, however, use a
variable reference in the name if you want the name not to be a constant.)
<P>
The result of this function is a string telling you how the variable
<VAR>variable</VAR> was defined:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`undefined'</SAMP>
<DD>
if <VAR>variable</VAR> was never defined.

<DT><SAMP>`default'</SAMP>
<DD>
if <VAR>variable</VAR> has a default definition, as is usual with <CODE>CC</CODE>
and so on.  See section <A HREF="make_90.html#SEC89">Variables Used by Implicit Rules</A>.
Note that if you have redefined a default variable, the <CODE>origin</CODE>
function will return the origin of the later definition.

<DT><SAMP>`environment'</SAMP>
<DD>
if <VAR>variable</VAR> was defined as an environment variable and the
<SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> option is <EM>not</EM> turned on (see section <A HREF="make_86.html#SEC85">Summary of Options</A>).

<DT><SAMP>`environment override'</SAMP>
<DD>
if <VAR>variable</VAR> was defined as an environment variable and the
<SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> option <EM>is</EM> turned on (see section <A HREF="make_86.html#SEC85">Summary of Options</A>).
<DT><SAMP>`file'</SAMP>
<DD>
if <VAR>variable</VAR> was defined in a makefile.

<DT><SAMP>`command line'</SAMP>
<DD>
if <VAR>variable</VAR> was defined on the command line.

<DT><SAMP>`override'</SAMP>
<DD>
if <VAR>variable</VAR> was defined with an <CODE>override</CODE> directive in a
makefile (see section <A HREF="make_65.html#SEC64">The <CODE>override</CODE> Directive</A>).

<DT><SAMP>`automatic'</SAMP>
<DD>
if <VAR>variable</VAR> is an automatic variable defined for the
execution of the commands for each rule
(see section <A HREF="make_95.html#SEC94">Automatic Variables</A>).
</DL>
<P>
This information is primarily useful (other than for your curiosity) to
determine if you want to believe the value of a variable.  For example,
suppose you have a makefile <TT>`foo'</TT> that includes another makefile
<TT>`bar'</TT>.  You want a variable <CODE>bletch</CODE> to be defined in <TT>`bar'</TT>
if you run the command <SAMP>`make -f bar'</SAMP>, even if the environment contains
a definition of <CODE>bletch</CODE>.  However, if <TT>`foo'</TT> defined
<CODE>bletch</CODE> before including <TT>`bar'</TT>, you do not want to override that
definition.  This could be done by using an <CODE>override</CODE> directive in
<TT>`foo'</TT>, giving that definition precedence over the later definition in
<TT>`bar'</TT>; unfortunately, the <CODE>override</CODE> directive would also
override any command line definitions.  So, <TT>`bar'</TT> could
include:<P>
<PRE>
ifdef bletch
ifeq "$(origin bletch)" "environment"
bletch = barf, gag, etc.
endif
endif
</PRE>
<P>
If <CODE>bletch</CODE> has been defined from the environment, this will redefine
it.
<P>
If you want to override a previous definition of <CODE>bletch</CODE> if it came
from the environment, even under <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP>, you could instead write:
<P>
<PRE>
ifneq "$(findstring environment,$(origin bletch))" ""
bletch = barf, gag, etc.
endif
</PRE>
<P>
Here the redefinition takes place if <SAMP>`$(origin bletch)'</SAMP> returns either
<SAMP>`environment'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`environment override'</SAMP>.
