<P>
<DFN>Inheritance</DFN> is what happens when one object or file derives some
of its contents by virtual copying from another object or file.  In
the case of C header files, inheritance means that one header file 
includes another header file and then replaces or adds something.
<P>
If the inheriting header file and the base header file have different
names, then inheritance is straightforward: simply write <SAMP>`#include
"<VAR>base</VAR>"'</SAMP> in the inheriting file.
<P>
Sometimes it is necessary to give the inheriting file the same name as
the base file.  This is less straightforward.
<P>
For example, suppose an application program uses the system header file
<TT>`sys/signal.h'</TT>, but the version of <TT>`/usr/include/sys/signal.h'</TT>
on a particular system doesn't do what the application program expects.
It might be convenient to define a "local" version, perhaps under the
name <TT>`/usr/local/include/sys/signal.h'</TT>, to override or add to the
one supplied by the system.
<P>
You can do this by using the option <SAMP>`-I.'</SAMP> for compilation, and
writing a file <TT>`sys/signal.h'</TT> that does what the application
program expects.  But making this file include the standard
<TT>`sys/signal.h'</TT> is not so easy--writing <SAMP>`#include
&#60;sys/signal.h&#62;'</SAMP> in that file doesn't work, because it includes your own
version of the file, not the standard system version.  Used in that file
itself, this leads to an infinite recursion and a fatal error in
compilation.
<P>
<SAMP>`#include &#60;/usr/include/sys/signal.h&#62;'</SAMP> would find the proper file,
but that is not clean, since it makes an assumption about where the
system header file is found.  This is bad for maintenance, since it
means that any change in where the system's header files are kept
requires a change somewhere else.
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
<P>
The clean way to solve this problem is to use 
<SAMP>`#include_next'</SAMP>, which means, "Include the <EM>next</EM> file with
this name."  This directive works like <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> except in
searching for the specified file: it starts searching the list of header
file directories <EM>after</EM> the directory in which the current file
was found.
<P>
Suppose you specify <SAMP>`-I /usr/local/include'</SAMP>, and the list of
directories to search also includes <TT>`/usr/include'</TT>; and suppose that
both directories contain a file named <TT>`sys/signal.h'</TT>.  Ordinary
<SAMP>`#include &#60;sys/signal.h&#62;'</SAMP> finds the file under
<TT>`/usr/local/include'</TT>.  If that file contains <SAMP>`#include_next
&#60;sys/signal.h&#62;'</SAMP>, it starts searching after that directory, and finds the
file in <TT>`/usr/include'</TT>.
