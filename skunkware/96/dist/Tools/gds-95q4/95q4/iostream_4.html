<P>
The GNU iostream library, <TT>`libio'</TT>, implements the standard
input and output facilities for C++.  These facilities are roughly
analogous (in their purpose and ubiquity, at least) with those defined
by the C <TT>`stdio'</TT> functions.
<P>
Although these definitions come from a library, rather than being part
of the "core language", they are sufficiently central to be specified
in the latest working papers for C++.
<P>
You can use two operators defined in this library for basic input and
output operations.  They are familiar from any C++ introductory
textbook: <CODE>&#60;&#60;</CODE> for output, and <CODE>&#62;&#62;</CODE> for input.  (Think of data
flowing in the direction of the "arrows".)
<P>
These operators are often used in conjunction with three streams that
are open by default: 
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>
<U>Variable:</U> ostream <B>cout</B><P>
The standard output stream, analogous to the C <CODE>stdout</CODE>.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>
<U>Variable:</U> istream <B>cin</B><P>
The standard input stream, analogous to the C <CODE>stdin</CODE>.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>
<U>Variable:</U> ostream <B>cerr</B><P>
An alternative output stream for errors, analogous to the C
<CODE>stderr</CODE>.
<P>
For example, this bare-bones C++ version of the traditional "hello"
program uses <CODE>&#60;&#60;</CODE> and <CODE>cout</CODE>:
<P>
<PRE>
#include &#60;iostream.h&#62;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  cout &#60;&#60; "Well, hi there.\n";
  return 0;
}
</PRE>
<P>
Casual use of these operators may be seductive, but--other than in
writing throwaway code for your own use--it is not necessarily simpler
than managing input and output in any other language.  For example,
robust code should check the state of the input and output streams
between operations (for example, using the method <CODE>good</CODE>).
See section <A HREF="iostream_7.html#SEC7">Checking the state of a stream</A>.  You may also need to
adjust maximum input or output field widths, using manipulators like
<CODE>setw</CODE> or <CODE>setprecision</CODE>.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
<U>Operator:</U> ostream <B>&#60;&#60;</B><P>
Write output to an open output stream of class <CODE>ostream</CODE>.
Defined by this library on any <VAR>object</VAR> of a C++ primitive type, and
on other classes of the library.  You can overload the definition for any
of your own applications' classes.
<P>
Returns a reference to the implied argument <CODE>*this</CODE> (the open stream it
writes on), permitting statements like
<PRE>
cout &#60;&#60; "The value of i is " &#60;&#60; i &#60;&#60; "\n";
</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
<U>Operator:</U> istream <B>&#62;&#62;</B><P>
Read input from an open input stream of class <CODE>istream</CODE>.  Defined
by this library on primitive numeric, pointer, and string types; you can
extend the definition for any of your own applications' classes.
<P>
Returns a reference to the implied argument <CODE>*this</CODE> (the open stream
it reads), permitting multiple inputs in one statement.
