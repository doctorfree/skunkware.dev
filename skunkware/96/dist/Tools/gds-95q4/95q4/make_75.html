<H2><A NAME="SEC74" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC74">Functions for File Names</A></H2>
<P>
Several of the built-in expansion functions relate specifically to
taking apart file names or lists of file names.
<P>
Each of the following functions performs a specific transformation on a
file name.  The argument of the function is regarded as a series of file
names, separated by whitespace.  (Leading and trailing whitespace is
ignored.)  Each file name in the series is transformed in the same way and
the results are concatenated with single spaces between them.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>$(dir <VAR>names</VAR>...)</CODE>
<DD>Extracts the directory-part of each file name in <VAR>names</VAR>.  The
directory-part of the file name is everything up through (and
including) the last slash in it.  If the file name contains no slash,
the directory part is the string <SAMP>`./'</SAMP>.  For example,

<PRE>
$(dir src/foo.c hacks)
</PRE>

produces the result <SAMP>`src/ ./'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX479"></A>
<A NAME="IDX480"></A>
<A NAME="IDX478"></A>
<DT><CODE>$(notdir <VAR>names</VAR>...)</CODE>
<DD>Extracts all but the directory-part of each file name in <VAR>names</VAR>.
If the file name contains no slash, it is left unchanged.  Otherwise,
everything through the last slash is removed from it.

A file name that ends with a slash becomes an empty string.  This is
unfortunate, because it means that the result does not always have the
same number of whitespace-separated file names as the argument had;
but we do not see any other valid alternative.

For example,

<PRE>
$(notdir src/foo.c hacks)
</PRE>

produces the result <SAMP>`foo.c hacks'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX482"></A>
<A NAME="IDX483"></A>
<A NAME="IDX481"></A>
<DT><CODE>$(suffix <VAR>names</VAR>...)</CODE>
<DD>Extracts the suffix of each file name in <VAR>names</VAR>.  If the file name
contains a period, the suffix is everything starting with the last
period.  Otherwise, the suffix is the empty string.  This frequently
means that the result will be empty when <VAR>names</VAR> is not, and if
<VAR>names</VAR> contains multiple file names, the result may contain fewer
file names.

For example,

<PRE>
$(suffix src/foo.c hacks)
</PRE>

produces the result <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX485"></A>
<A NAME="IDX486"></A>
<A NAME="IDX484"></A>
<DT><CODE>$(basename <VAR>names</VAR>...)</CODE>
<DD>Extracts all but the suffix of each file name in <VAR>names</VAR>.  If the
file name contains a period, the basename is everything starting up to
(and not including) the last period.  Otherwise, the basename is the
entire file name.  For example,

<PRE>
$(basename src/foo.c hacks)
</PRE>

produces the result <SAMP>`src/foo hacks'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX488"></A>
<A NAME="IDX489"></A>
<A NAME="IDX487"></A>
<DT><CODE>$(addsuffix <VAR>suffix</VAR>,<VAR>names</VAR>...)</CODE>
<DD>The argument <VAR>names</VAR> is regarded as a series of names, separated
by whitespace; <VAR>suffix</VAR> is used as a unit.  The value of
<VAR>suffix</VAR> is appended to the end of each individual name and the
resulting larger names are concatenated with single spaces between
them.  For example,

<PRE>
$(addsuffix .c,foo bar)
</PRE>

produces the result <SAMP>`foo.c bar.c'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX491"></A>
<A NAME="IDX492"></A>
<A NAME="IDX490"></A>
<DT><CODE>$(addprefix <VAR>prefix</VAR>,<VAR>names</VAR>...)</CODE>
<DD>The argument <VAR>names</VAR> is regarded as a series of names, separated
by whitespace; <VAR>prefix</VAR> is used as a unit.  The value of
<VAR>prefix</VAR> is prepended to the front of each individual name and the
resulting larger names are concatenated with single spaces between
them.  For example,

<PRE>
$(addprefix src/,foo bar)
</PRE>

produces the result <SAMP>`src/foo src/bar'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX494"></A>
<A NAME="IDX495"></A>
<A NAME="IDX493"></A>
<DT><CODE>$(join <VAR>list1</VAR>,<VAR>list2</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Concatenates the two arguments word by word: the two first words (one
from each argument) concatenated form the first word of the result, the
two second words form the second word of the result, and so on.  So the
<VAR>n</VAR>th word of the result comes from the <VAR>n</VAR>th word of each
argument.  If one argument has more words that the other, the extra
words are copied unchanged into the result.

For example, <SAMP>`$(join a b,.c .o)'</SAMP> produces <SAMP>`a.c b.o'</SAMP>.

Whitespace between the words in the lists is not preserved; it is
replaced with a single space.

This function can merge the results of the <CODE>dir</CODE> and
<CODE>notdir</CODE> functions, to produce the original list of files which
was given to those two functions.
<A NAME="IDX497"></A>
<A NAME="IDX498"></A>
<A NAME="IDX496"></A>
<DT><CODE>$(word <VAR>n</VAR>,<VAR>text</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Returns the <VAR>n</VAR>th word of <VAR>text</VAR>.  The legitimate values of
<VAR>n</VAR> start from 1.  If <VAR>n</VAR> is bigger than the number of words
in <VAR>text</VAR>, the value is empty.  For example,

<PRE>
$(word 2, foo bar baz)
</PRE>

returns <SAMP>`bar'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX500"></A>
<A NAME="IDX499"></A>
<DT><CODE>$(words <VAR>text</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Returns the number of words in <VAR>text</VAR>.  
Thus, the last word of <VAR>text</VAR> is
<CODE>$(word $(words <VAR>text</VAR>),<VAR>text</VAR>)</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX502"></A>
<A NAME="IDX501"></A>
<DT><CODE>$(firstword <VAR>names</VAR>...)</CODE>
<DD>The argument <VAR>names</VAR> is regarded as a series of names, separated
by whitespace.  The value is the first name in the series.  The rest
of the names are ignored.

For example,

<PRE>
$(firstword foo bar)
</PRE>

produces the result <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP>.  Although <CODE>$(firstword
<VAR>text</VAR>)</CODE> is the same as <CODE>$(word 1,<VAR>text</VAR>)</CODE>, the
<CODE>firstword</CODE> function is retained for its simplicity.
<A NAME="IDX504"></A>
<A NAME="IDX503"></A>
<DT><CODE>$(wildcard <VAR>pattern</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>The argument <VAR>pattern</VAR> is a file name pattern, typically containing
wildcard characters (as in shell file name patterns).  The result of
<CODE>wildcard</CODE> is a space-separated list of the names of existing files
that match the pattern.
