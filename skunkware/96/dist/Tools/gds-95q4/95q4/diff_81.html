<P>
The <CODE>sdiff</CODE> command merges two files and interactively outputs the
results.  Its arguments are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
sdiff -o <VAR>outfile</VAR> <VAR>options</VAR>... <VAR>from-file</VAR> <VAR>to-file</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
This merges <VAR>from-file</VAR> with <VAR>to-file</VAR>, with output to <VAR>outfile</VAR>.
If <VAR>from-file</VAR> is a directory and <VAR>to-file</VAR> is not, <CODE>sdiff</CODE>
compares the file in <VAR>from-file</VAR> whose file name is that of <VAR>to-file</VAR>,
and vice versa.  <VAR>from-file</VAR> and <VAR>to-file</VAR> may not both be
directories.
<P>
<CODE>sdiff</CODE> options begin with <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, so normally <VAR>from-file</VAR>
and <VAR>to-file</VAR> may not begin with <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>.  However, <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> as an
argument by itself treats the remaining arguments as file names even if
they begin with <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>.  You may not use <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> as an input file.
<P>
An exit status of 0 means no differences were found, 1 means some
differences were found, and 2 means trouble.
<P>
<CODE>sdiff</CODE> without <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> (or <SAMP>`--output'</SAMP>) produces a
side-by-side difference.  This usage is obsolete; use <SAMP>`diff
--side-by-side'</SAMP> instead.
