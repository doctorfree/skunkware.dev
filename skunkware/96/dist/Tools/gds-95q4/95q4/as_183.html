<P>
The 960 architectures provide combined Compare-and-Branch instructions
that permit you to store the branch target in the lower 13 bits of the
instruction word itself.  However, if you specify a branch target far
enough away that its address won't fit in 13 bits, the assembler can
either issue an error, or convert your Compare-and-Branch instruction
into separate instructions to do the compare and the branch.

<P>
Whether <CODE>as</CODE> gives an error or expands the instruction depends
on two choices you can make: whether you use the <SAMP>`-no-relax'</SAMP> option,
and whether you use a "Compare and Branch" instruction or a "Compare
and Jump" instruction.  The "Jump" instructions are <EM>always</EM>
expanded if necessary; the "Branch" instructions are expanded when
necessary <EM>unless</EM> you specify <CODE>-no-relax</CODE>---in which case
<CODE>as</CODE> gives an error instead.
<P>
These are the Compare-and-Branch instructions, their "Jump" variants,
and the instruction pairs they may expand into:
