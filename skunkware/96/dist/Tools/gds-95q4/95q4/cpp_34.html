<H3><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="cpp_toc.html#TOC35">Keeping Deleted Code for Future Reference</A></H3>
<P>
If you replace or delete a part of the program but want to keep the old
code around as a comment for future reference, the easy way to do this
is to put <SAMP>`#if 0'</SAMP> before it and <SAMP>`#endif'</SAMP> after it.  This is
better than using comment delimiters <SAMP>`/*'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`*/'</SAMP> since those
won't work if the code already contains comments (C comments do not
nest).
<P>
This works even if the code being turned off contains conditionals, but
they must be entire conditionals (balanced <SAMP>`#if'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`#endif'</SAMP>).
<P>
Conversely, do not use <SAMP>`#if 0'</SAMP> for comments which are not C code.
Use the comment delimiters <SAMP>`/*'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`*/'</SAMP> instead.  The
interior of <SAMP>`#if 0'</SAMP> must consist of complete tokens; in particular,
singlequote characters must balance.  But comments often contain
unbalanced singlequote characters (known in English as apostrophes).
These confuse <SAMP>`#if 0'</SAMP>.  They do not confuse <SAMP>`/*'</SAMP>.
