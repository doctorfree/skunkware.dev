<P>
If <CODE>diff</CODE> thinks that either of the two files it is comparing is
binary (a non-text file), it normally treats that pair of files much as
if the summary output format had been selected (see section <A HREF="diff_8.html#SEC8">Summarizing Which Files Differ</A>), and
reports only that the binary files are different.  This is because line
by line comparisons are usually not meaningful for binary files.
<P>
<CODE>diff</CODE> determines whether a file is text or binary by checking the
first few bytes in the file; the exact number of bytes is system
dependent, but it is typically several thousand.  If every character in
that part of the file is non-null, <CODE>diff</CODE> considers the file to be
text; otherwise it considers the file to be binary.
<P>
Sometimes you might want to force <CODE>diff</CODE> to consider files to be
text.  For example, you might be comparing text files that contain
null characters; <CODE>diff</CODE> would erroneously decide that those are
non-text files.  Or you might be comparing documents that are in a
format used by a word processing system that uses null characters to
indicate special formatting.  You can force <CODE>diff</CODE> to consider all
files to be text files, and compare them line by line, by using the
<SAMP>`-a'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--text'</SAMP> option.  If the files you compare using this
option do not in fact contain text, they will probably contain few
newline characters, and the <CODE>diff</CODE> output will consist of hunks
showing differences between long lines of whatever characters the files
contain.
<P>
You can also force <CODE>diff</CODE> to consider all files to be binary files,
and report only whether they differ (but not how).  Use the
<SAMP>`--brief'</SAMP> option for this.
<P>
In operating systems that distinguish between text and binary files,
<CODE>diff</CODE> normally reads and writes all data as text.  Use the
<SAMP>`--binary'</SAMP> option to force <CODE>diff</CODE> to read and write binary
data instead.  This option has no effect on a Posix-compliant system
like GNU or traditional Unix.  However, many personal computer
operating systems represent the end of a line with a carriage return
followed by a newline.  On such systems, <CODE>diff</CODE> normally ignores
these carriage returns on input and generates them at the end of each
output line, but with the <SAMP>`--binary'</SAMP> option <CODE>diff</CODE> treats
each carriage return as just another input character, and does not
generate a carriage return at the end of each output line.  This can be
useful when dealing with non-text files that are meant to be
interchanged with Posix-compliant systems.
<P>
If you want to compare two files byte by byte, you can use the
<CODE>cmp</CODE> program with the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option to show the values of each
differing byte in the two files.  With GNU <CODE>cmp</CODE>, you can also use
the <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP> option to show the ASCII representation of those bytes.
See section <A HREF="diff_70.html#SEC70">Invoking <CODE>cmp</CODE></A>, for more information.
<P>
If <CODE>diff3</CODE> thinks that any of the files it is comparing is binary
(a non-text file), it normally reports an error, because such
comparisons are usually not useful.  <CODE>diff3</CODE> uses the same test as
<CODE>diff</CODE> to decide whether a file is binary.  As with <CODE>diff</CODE>, if
the input files contain a few non-text characters but otherwise are like
text files, you can force <CODE>diff3</CODE> to consider all files to be text
files and compare them line by line by using the <SAMP>`-a'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--text'</SAMP> options.
