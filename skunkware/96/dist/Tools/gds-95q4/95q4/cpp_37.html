<TITLE>The C Preprocessor - #error Directive</TITLE>

<H3><A NAME="SEC38" HREF="cpp_toc.html#TOC38">The <SAMP>`#error'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`#warning'</SAMP> Directives</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX91"></A>
<P>
The directive <SAMP>`#error'</SAMP> causes the preprocessor to report a fatal
error.  The rest of the line that follows <SAMP>`#error'</SAMP> is used as the
error message.
<P>
You would use <SAMP>`#error'</SAMP> inside of a conditional that detects a
combination of parameters which you know the program does not properly
support.  For example, if you know that the program will not run
properly on a Vax, you might write
<P>
<PRE>
#ifdef __vax__
#error Won't work on Vaxen.  See comments at get_last_object.
#endif
</PRE>
<P>
See section <A HREF="cpp_14.html#SEC15">Nonstandard Predefined Macros</A>, for why this works.
<P>
If you have several configuration parameters that must be set up by
the installation in a consistent way, you can use conditionals to detect
an inconsistency and report it with <SAMP>`#error'</SAMP>.  For example,
<P>
<PRE>
#if HASH_TABLE_SIZE % 2 == 0 || HASH_TABLE_SIZE % 3 == 0 \
    || HASH_TABLE_SIZE % 5 == 0
#error HASH_TABLE_SIZE should not be divisible by a small prime
#endif
</PRE>
<A NAME="IDX92"></A>
<P>
The directive <SAMP>`#warning'</SAMP> is like the directive <SAMP>`#error'</SAMP>, but causes
the preprocessor to issue a warning and continue preprocessing.  The rest of
the line that follows <SAMP>`#warning'</SAMP> is used as the warning message.
<P>
You might use <SAMP>`#warning'</SAMP> in obsolete header files, with a message
directing the user to the header file which should be used instead.
