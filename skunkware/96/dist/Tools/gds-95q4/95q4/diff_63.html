<P>
Sometimes mailers, editors, or other programs change spaces into tabs,
or vice versa.  If this happens to a patch file or an input file, the
files might look the same, but <CODE>patch</CODE> will not be able to match
them properly.  If this problem occurs, use the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--ignore-white-space'</SAMP> option, which makes <CODE>patch</CODE> compare
white space loosely so that any sequence of white space in the patch file
matches any sequence of white space in the input files.  Non-white-space
characters must still match exactly.  Each line of the context must
still match a line in the input file.
