<P>
We now provide tools for the HP 9000/700 running both HPUX version 9
and version 10.  We have made an effort to try to determine which
version each of our HPUX customers requires; however, we expect that
many of you will wish to receive one or the other.  Please let us know
which version you need by sending mail to <CODE>production@cygnus.com</CODE>, or by
calling the Cygnus Support office at 800-CYGNUS-1, or by fax to 415-903-0122.
