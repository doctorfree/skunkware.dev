<P>
The format for running the <CODE>diff</CODE> command is:
<P>
<PRE>
diff <VAR>options</VAR>... <VAR>from-file</VAR> <VAR>to-file</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
In the simplest case, <CODE>diff</CODE> compares the contents of the two files
<VAR>from-file</VAR> and <VAR>to-file</VAR>.  A file name of <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> stands for
text read from the standard input.  As a special case, <SAMP>`diff - -'</SAMP>
compares a copy of standard input to itself.
<P>
If <VAR>from-file</VAR> is a directory and <VAR>to-file</VAR> is not, <CODE>diff</CODE>
compares the file in <VAR>from-file</VAR> whose file name is that of <VAR>to-file</VAR>,
and vice versa.  The non-directory file must not be <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>.
<P>
If both <VAR>from-file</VAR> and <VAR>to-file</VAR> are directories,
<CODE>diff</CODE> compares corresponding files in both directories, in
alphabetical order; this comparison is not recursive unless the
<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--recursive'</SAMP> option is given.  <CODE>diff</CODE> never
compares the actual contents of a directory as if it were a file.  The
file that is fully specified may not be standard input, because standard
input is nameless and the notion of "file with the same name" does not
apply.
<P>
<CODE>diff</CODE> options begin with <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, so normally <VAR>from-file</VAR> and
<VAR>to-file</VAR> may not begin with <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>.  However, <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> as an
argument by itself treats the remaining arguments as file names even if
they begin with <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>.
<P>
An exit status of 0 means no differences were found, 1 means some
differences were found, and 2 means trouble.
