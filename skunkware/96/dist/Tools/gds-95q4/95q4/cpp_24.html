<P>
A <DFN>self-referential</DFN> macro is one whose name appears in its definition.
A special feature of ANSI Standard C is that the self-reference is not
considered a macro call.  It is passed into the preprocessor output
unchanged.
<P>
Let's consider an example:
<P>
<PRE>
#define foo (4 + foo)
</PRE>
<P>
where <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> is also a variable in your program.
<P>
Following the ordinary rules, each reference to <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> will expand into
<SAMP>`(4 + foo)'</SAMP>; then this will be rescanned and will expand into <SAMP>`(4
+ (4 + foo))'</SAMP>; and so on until it causes a fatal error (memory full) in the
preprocessor.
<P>
However, the special rule about self-reference cuts this process short
after one step, at <SAMP>`(4 + foo)'</SAMP>.  Therefore, this macro definition
has the possibly useful effect of causing the program to add 4 to
the value of <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> wherever <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> is referred to.
<P>
In most cases, it is a bad idea to take advantage of this feature.  A
person reading the program who sees that <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> is a variable will
not expect that it is a macro as well.  The reader will come across the
identifier <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> in the program and think its value should be that
of the variable <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP>, whereas in fact the value is four greater.
<P>
The special rule for self-reference applies also to <DFN>indirect</DFN>
self-reference.  This is the case where a macro <VAR>x</VAR> expands to use a
macro <SAMP>`y'</SAMP>, and the expansion of <SAMP>`y'</SAMP> refers to the macro
<SAMP>`x'</SAMP>.  The resulting reference to <SAMP>`x'</SAMP> comes indirectly from the
expansion of <SAMP>`x'</SAMP>, so it is a self-reference and is not further
expanded.  Thus, after
<P>
<PRE>
#define x (4 + y)
#define y (2 * x)
</PRE>
<P>
<SAMP>`x'</SAMP> would expand into <SAMP>`(4 + (2 * x))'</SAMP>.  Clear?
<P>
But suppose <SAMP>`y'</SAMP> is used elsewhere, not from the definition of <SAMP>`x'</SAMP>.
Then the use of <SAMP>`x'</SAMP> in the expansion of <SAMP>`y'</SAMP> is not a self-reference
because <SAMP>`x'</SAMP> is not "in progress".  So it does expand.  However,
the expansion of <SAMP>`x'</SAMP> contains a reference to <SAMP>`y'</SAMP>, and that
is an indirect self-reference now because <SAMP>`y'</SAMP> is "in progress".
The result is that <SAMP>`y'</SAMP> expands to <SAMP>`(2 * (4 + y))'</SAMP>.
<P>
It is not clear that this behavior would ever be useful, but it is specified
by the ANSI C standard, so you may need to understand it.
