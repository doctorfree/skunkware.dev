Some general notes:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Rebuilding from source has had a number of problems since we introduced
GDBTK in the <CODE>progressive-95q1</CODE> release.  As of 
<CODE>progressive-95q4</CODE>, we have fixed the configuration scheme so that 
GDBTK (and the rest of the CDK) should build without any other 
problems with regard to X Windows.

The configuration scheme will try to find your X libraries and include
files by first running the program <TT>`xmkmf'</TT>.  If that fails for any
reason, it should look through a long list of probable directories to
find the lib and include directories.

If all of this fails, you can specify the location of your X libraries
and include files with the <CODE>--x-includes=/some/where</CODE> and
<CODE>--x-libraries=/some/where</CODE> command line options at configure-time.

If you do not have X Windows on your Unix system, configure with
the option <CODE>--without-x</CODE>.

<LI>
If you are rebuilding from source and wish to configure GDB to use
the new Tk-based GUI, 
you must use the option <CODE>--enable-gdbtk</CODE> on the command line to
<CODE>configure</CODE>. 

<EM>Note:</EM> Using <SAMP>`--enable-gdbtk'</SAMP> when rebuilding under Solaris or
HPUX is known to fail.  Contact Cygnus for an available patch if this is
a problem for you.  (Reference PR #6743)

<LI>
You must run <CODE>configure</CODE> with the option <CODE>--with-stabs</CODE> when
rebuilding the CDK under SGI/Irix4 and Irix5 as well as on the
Alpha running OSF/1 v2.0.

<LI>
You cannot run <CODE>configure</CODE> in the background; when configuring
the program <CODE>expect</CODE>, <CODE>configure</CODE> hangs with a terminal
message similar to the following:

<PRE>
checking mask type of select
checking return type of signal handlers
checking to see if signals need to be re-armed
checking whether cross-compiling... no
checking to see if stty reads from stdin or stdout

[1]  + Suspended (tty output) ../progressive/configu\
re --prefix=`pwd`/stage1 -v |&#38; tee config.out
</PRE>

at which point the shell waits for you to put the process in the
foreground again.
</UL>
<P>
Please report any problems you have with building under
<CODE>progressive-95q4</CODE>.
