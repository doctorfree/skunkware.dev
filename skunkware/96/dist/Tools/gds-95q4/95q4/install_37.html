<H1><A NAME="SEC37" HREF="install_toc.html#TOC37">Cross-development environment</A></H1>
<P>
Using the Developer's Kit in one of the cross-development configurations
usually requires some attention to setting up the target environment.
(A cross-development configuration is used for developing software to
run on a different machine (the <DFN>target</DFN>) from the development tools
themselves (which run on the <DFN>host</DFN>)---for example, you might use a
SPARCstation to generate and debug code for an AMD 29K-based
board.)
<P>
To allow our tools to work with your target environment (except for
real-time operating systems, which provide full operating system
support), you need to set up:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
the C run-time environment (described below).

<LI>
<DFN>stubs</DFN>, or minimal versions of operating system subroutines for the
C subroutine library.  See section `System Calls' in <CITE>The Cygnus C Support Library</CITE>.

<LI>
a connection to the debugger.  See section `Remote Debugging' in <CITE>Debugging with GDB</CITE>.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>The C Run-Time Environment (<CODE>crt0</CODE>)</H3>
<P>
To link and run C or C++ programs, you need to define a small module
(usually written in assembler as <TT>`crt0.s'</TT>) that makes sure the
hardware is initialized for C conventions before calling <CODE>main</CODE>.
<P>
There are some examples of <TT>`crt0.s'</TT> code (along with examples of
system call stub code) available in the source code for your Developer's
Kit.  Look in the directories under:
<P>
<PRE>
<VAR>installdir</VAR>/progressive-95q4/src/newlib/libc/sys
</PRE>
<P>
(<VAR>installdir</VAR> refers to your installation directory, by default
<TT>`/usr/cygnus'</TT>.)  For example, look in <TT>`.../sys/h8300hms'</TT>
for Hitachi H8/300 bare boards, or in <TT>`.../sys/sparclite'</TT>
for the Fujitsu SPARClite board.  More examples are available under
the directory:
<P>
<PRE>
<VAR>installdir</VAR>/progressive-95q4/src/newlib/stub
</PRE>
<P>
To write your own <TT>`crt0.s'</TT>, you need this information about
your target:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
A memory map.  What memory is available, and where?

<LI>
Which way does the stack grow?

<LI>
What output format do you use?
</UL>
<P>
At a minimum, your <TT>`crt0.s'</TT> must do these things:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Define the symbol <CODE>start</CODE> (<SAMP>`_start'</SAMP> in assembler code).
Execution begins at this symbol.

<LI>
Set up the stack pointer <SAMP>`sp'</SAMP>.  It is largely up to you to choose
where to store your stack within the constraints of your target's memory
map.  Perhaps the simplest choice is to choose a fixed-size area
somewhere in the uninitialized-data section (often called <SAMP>`bss'</SAMP>).
Remember that whether you choose the low address or the high address in
this area depends on the direction your stack grows.

<LI>
Initialize all memory in the uninitialized-data (<SAMP>`bss'</SAMP>) section to
zero.  The easiest way to do this is with the help of a linker script
(see section `Command Language' in <CITE>Using LD; the GNU linker</CITE>).
Use a linker script to define symbols such as <SAMP>`bss_start'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`bss_end'</SAMP> to record the boundaries of this section; then you can
use a <SAMP>`for'</SAMP> loop to initialize all memory between them in
<TT>`crt0.s'</TT>.

<LI>
Call <CODE>main</CODE>.  Nothing else will!
</OL>
<P>
A more complete <TT>`crt0.s'</TT> might also do the following:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Define an <SAMP>`_exit'</SAMP> subroutine (this is the C name; in your assembler
code, use the label <SAMP>`__exit'</SAMP>, with two leading underbars).  Its
precise behavior depends on the details of your system, and on your
choice.  Possibilities include trapping back to the boot monitor, if
there is one; or to the loader, if there is no monitor; or even back to
the symbol <CODE>start</CODE>.

<LI>
If your target has no monitor to mediate communications with the
debugger, you must set up the hardware exception handler in
<TT>`crt0.s'</TT>.  See section `The GDB remote serial protocol' in <CITE>Debugging with GDB</CITE>, for details on how to use the
GDB generic remote-target facilities for this purpose.

<LI>
Perform other hardware-dependent initialization; for example,
initializing an MMU or an auxiliary floating-point chip.


<LI>
Define low-level input and output subroutines.  For example, <TT>`crt0.s'</TT>
is a convenient place to define the minimal assembly-level routines
described in section `System Calls' in <CITE>The Cygnus C Support Library</CITE>.
