<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="rebuilding_toc.html#SEC7">Source and Build Directories</A></H2>

<P>
Builds are most often done in the same directory where the source lies.
However, if you don't have enough disk space there, or if you wish to
compile the Developer's Kit for more than one configuration, you may
find it easiest to configure and build in a different directory from the
source. 

</P>
<P>
To build in a location different from the source directory, first create
the build directory, which we'll call <TT>`<VAR>objdir</VAR>'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
$ mkdir <VAR>objdir</VAR>
$ cd <VAR>objdir</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
Then run <CODE>configure</CODE> from the top level of the source directory,
which we'll call <TT>`<VAR>srcdir</VAR>'</TT>.  You don't need to specify the
<SAMP>`--srcdir=<VAR>path</VAR>'</SAMP> option to <CODE>configure</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="rebuilding_3.html#SEC2">Options to <CODE>configure</CODE></A>), but we show it
here for the purposes of the example:

</P>

<PRE>
$ <VAR>srcdir</VAR>/configure --srcdir=<VAR>srcdir</VAR> ...
</PRE>

<P>
The default for <VAR>srcdir</VAR> is the directory in which <CODE>configure</CODE>
resides.  

</P>
<P>
<CODE>configure</CODE> creates a <TT>`Makefile'</TT> in the current directory,
<TT>`<VAR>objdir</VAR>'</TT>.  When you run <CODE>make</CODE> here, object files are
created in <TT>`<VAR>objdir</VAR>'</TT> from the source code in
<TT>`<VAR>srcdir</VAR>'</TT>.  For example (assume source code is in
<TT>`/usr/local/src'</TT>, and binaries are to be installed under
<TT>`/usr/local'</TT>):

</P>

<PRE>
$ mkdir /usr/local/obj/sun4
$ cd /usr/local/obj/sun4
$ /usr/local/src/configure --srcdir=/usr/local/src
Configuring for a sparc-sun-sunos4.1.3_U1 host.
...<EM>time passes</EM>...
Created "Makefile" in /usr/local/obj/sun4...
</PRE>

<P>
This is extremely useful if you need to create more than one
installation of the Developer's Kit.  For example, if you wish to
rebuild and install the toolkit for a given host as well as a
cross-development system for the same host, you can use a different
build directory for each toolkit, with different options to
<CODE>configure</CODE> for each build.  In this way, the object files for each
configuration exist simultaneously but independently, even if they are
meant to install finally into the same repository.

</P>
<P>
See section <A HREF="rebuilding_21.html#SEC20">Possible build variations</A>, for examples of the build
process using separate directories for source and object files.

</P>
<P>
Again, please contact Cygnus Support if you have any trouble.
