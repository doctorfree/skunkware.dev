<P>
We've tried to make the programs in this release of the Cygnus Support
Developer's Kit as trouble-free as possible.  If you do encounter
problems, however, we'd like to diagnose and fix the problem as quickly
as possible.  You can help us do that by using the script <CODE>send-pr</CODE>
to send us your problem reports (PRs). <CODE>send-pr</CODE> comes with
this release, and is easily configured to send reports back to Cygnus.
<P>
<CODE>send-pr</CODE> invokes an editor on a problem report form (after trying
to fill in some fields with reasonable default values).  After you exit
the editor, <CODE>send-pr</CODE> sends the filled out form to the Problem
Report Management System (PRMS) at Cygnus Support.  You can use the
environment variable <CODE>EDITOR</CODE> to specify which editor to use (the
default is <CODE>vi</CODE>). Emacs users will find PRMS especially easy
to use.
<P>
For more information on <CODE>send-pr</CODE>, see section `Overview' in <CITE>Reporting Problems</CITE>.

<H3>Filling out a problem report</H3>
<P>
Problem reports are structured so that a database program can manage
them. When you fill out the form, please remember the following
guidelines:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Each PR needs a valid <DFN>customer-id</DFN> and <DFN>category</DFN>.

<LI>
Describe only one problem per PR.

<LI>
For follow-up mail, use the same subject line as the one in the
automatic acknowledgment. It shows the category, the PR number and
the original synopsis line.  This causes your mail to automatically be
filed with the original bug report. Your followup comments will be sent
to all the people who are working on the bug.

<LI>
Please try to make the subject or synopsis line as informative as
possible.  For misbehaving software, you might use a sentence of the
form <SAMP>`Encrypted rlogin hangs if you send interrupt'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`g++:
calling wrong overloaded function.'</SAMP>

<LI>
You don't need to delete the comment lines while editing the PR
form; this is done by <CODE>send-pr</CODE>.  Put your information before or
after the comments.
</UL>
<P>
Consult the section `Examples and guidelines for effective PRs' in <CITE>Reporting Problems</CITE>, for more discussion on this topic.
