<P>
<CODE>diff3</CODE> can mark conflicts in the merged output by
bracketing them with special marker lines.  A conflict
that comes from two files <VAR>A</VAR> and <VAR>B</VAR> is marked as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60; <VAR>A</VAR>
lines from <VAR>A</VAR>
=======
lines from <VAR>B</VAR>
&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; <VAR>B</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
A conflict that comes from three files <VAR>A</VAR>, <VAR>B</VAR> and <VAR>C</VAR> is
marked as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60; <VAR>A</VAR>
lines from <VAR>A</VAR>
||||||| <VAR>B</VAR>
lines from <VAR>B</VAR>
=======
lines from <VAR>C</VAR>
&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; <VAR>C</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
The <SAMP>`-A'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--show-all'</SAMP> option acts like the <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP>
option, except that it brackets conflicts, and it outputs all changes
from <VAR>older</VAR> to <VAR>yours</VAR>, not just the unmerged changes.  Thus,
given the sample input files (see section <A HREF="diff_47.html#SEC47">A Third Sample Input File</A>), <SAMP>`diff3
-A lao tzu tao'</SAMP> puts brackets around the conflict where only <TT>`tzu'</TT>
differs:
<P>
<PRE>
&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60; tzu
=======
The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way;
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; tao
</PRE>
<P>
And it outputs the three-way conflict as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60; lao
||||||| tzu
They both may be called deep and profound.
Deeper and more profound,
The door of all subtleties!

&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; tao
</PRE>
<P>
The <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--show-overlap'</SAMP> option outputs less information
than the <SAMP>`-A'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--show-all'</SAMP> option, because it outputs only
unmerged changes, and it never outputs the contents of the second
file.  Thus the <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> option acts like the <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> option,
except that it brackets the first and third files from three-way
overlapping changes.  Similarly, <SAMP>`-X'</SAMP> acts like <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP>, except
it brackets all its (necessarily overlapping) changes.  For example,
for the three-way overlapping change above, the <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-X'</SAMP>
options output the following:
<P>
<PRE>
&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60; lao
=======

  -- The Way of Lao-Tzu, tr. Wing-tsit Chan
&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; tao
</PRE>
<P>
If you are comparing files that have meaningless or uninformative names,
you can use the <SAMP>`-L <VAR>label</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--label=<VAR>label</VAR>'</SAMP>
option to show alternate names in the <SAMP>`&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`|||||||'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;'</SAMP> brackets.  This option can be given up to three
times, once for each input file.  Thus <SAMP>`diff3 -A -L X -L Y -L Z A
B C'</SAMP> acts like <SAMP>`diff3 -A A B C'</SAMP>, except that the output looks like
it came from files named <SAMP>`X'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`Y'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`Z'</SAMP> rather than
from files named <SAMP>`A'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`B'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`C'</SAMP>.
