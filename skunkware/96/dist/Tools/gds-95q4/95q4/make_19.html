<P>
Sometimes it is useful to have a makefile that is mostly just like
another makefile.  You can often use the <SAMP>`include'</SAMP> directive to
include one in the other, and add more targets or variable definitions.
However, if the two makefiles give different commands for the same
target, <CODE>make</CODE> will not let you just do this.  But there is another way.
<A NAME="IDX95"></A>
<P>
In the containing makefile (the one that wants to include the other),
you can use a match-anything pattern rule to say that to remake any
target that cannot be made from the information in the containing
makefile, <CODE>make</CODE> should look in another makefile.
See section <A HREF="make_92.html#SEC91">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</A>, for more information on pattern rules.
<P>
For example, if you have a makefile called <TT>`Makefile'</TT> that says how
to make the target <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> (and other targets), you can write a
makefile called <TT>`GNUmakefile'</TT> that contains:
<P>
<PRE>
foo:
        frobnicate &#62; foo

%: force
        @$(MAKE) -f Makefile $@
force: ;
</PRE>
<P>
If you say <SAMP>`make foo'</SAMP>, <CODE>make</CODE> will find <TT>`GNUmakefile'</TT>,
read it, and see that to make <TT>`foo'</TT>, it needs to run the command
<SAMP>`frobnicate &#62; foo'</SAMP>.  If you say <SAMP>`make bar'</SAMP>, <CODE>make</CODE> will
find no way to make <TT>`bar'</TT> in <TT>`GNUmakefile'</TT>, so it will use the
commands from the pattern rule: <SAMP>`make -f Makefile bar'</SAMP>.  If
<TT>`Makefile'</TT> provides a rule for updating <TT>`bar'</TT>, <CODE>make</CODE>
will apply the rule.  And likewise for any other target that
<TT>`GNUmakefile'</TT> does not say how to make.
<P>
The way this works is that the pattern rule has a pattern of just
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP>, so it matches any target whatever.  The rule specifies a
dependency <TT>`force'</TT>, to guarantee that the commands will be run even
if the target file already exists.  We give <TT>`force'</TT> target empty
commands to prevent <CODE>make</CODE> from searching for an implicit rule to
build it--otherwise it would apply the same match-anything rule to
<TT>`force'</TT> itself and create a dependency loop!
