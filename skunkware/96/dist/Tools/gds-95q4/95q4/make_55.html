<P>
It is sometimes useful to define commands which do nothing.  This is done
simply by giving a command that consists of nothing but whitespace.  For
example:
<P>
<PRE>
target: ;
</PRE>
<P>
defines an empty command string for <TT>`target'</TT>.  You could also use a
line beginning with a tab character to define an empty command string,
but this would be confusing because such a line looks empty.

<P>
You may be wondering why you would want to define a command string that
does nothing.  The only reason this is useful is to prevent a target
from getting implicit commands (from implicit rules or the
<CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE> special target; see section <A HREF="make_87.html#SEC86">Using Implicit Rules</A> and 
see section <A HREF="make_99.html#SEC98">Defining Last-Resort Default Rules</A>).<P>
You may be inclined to define empty command strings for targets that are
not actual files, but only exist so that their dependencies can be
remade.  However, this is not the best way to do that, because the
dependencies may not be remade properly if the target file actually does exist.
See section <A HREF="make_32.html#SEC31">Phony Targets</A>, for a better way to do this.
