<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="infoman_toc.html#TOC5">Selecting a New Node</A></H1>
<P>
This section details the numerous Info commands which select a new node
to view in the current window.
<P>
The most basic node commands are <SAMP>`n'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`p'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`u'</SAMP>, and
<SAMP>`l'</SAMP>.
<P>
When you are viewing a node, the top line of the node contains some Info
<DFN>pointers</DFN> which describe where the next, previous, and up nodes
are.  Info uses this line to move about the node structure of the file
when you use the following commands:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX54"></A>
<A NAME="IDX55"></A>
<DT><CODE>n</CODE> (<CODE>next-node</CODE>)
<DD>Selects the `Next' node.  

<A NAME="IDX56"></A>
<A NAME="IDX57"></A>
<DT><CODE>p</CODE> (<CODE>prev-node</CODE>)
<DD>Selects the `Prev' node.

<A NAME="IDX58"></A>
<A NAME="IDX59"></A>
<DT><CODE>u</CODE> (<CODE>up-node</CODE>)
<DD>Selects the `Up' node.
</DL>
<P>
You can easily select a node that you have already viewed in this window
by using the <SAMP>`l'</SAMP> command -- this name stands for "last", and
actually moves through the list of already visited nodes for this
window.  <SAMP>`l'</SAMP> with a negative numeric argument moves forward through
the history of nodes for this window, so you can quickly step between
two adjacent (in viewing history) nodes.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX60"></A>
<A NAME="IDX61"></A>
<DT><CODE>l</CODE> (<CODE>history-node</CODE>)
<DD>Selects the most recently selected node in this window.
</DL>
<P>
Two additional commands make it easy to select the most commonly
selected nodes; they are <SAMP>`t'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`d'</SAMP>.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX62"></A>
<A NAME="IDX63"></A>
<DT><CODE>t</CODE> (<CODE>top-node</CODE>)
<DD>Selects the node <SAMP>`Top'</SAMP> in the current info file.

<A NAME="IDX64"></A>
<A NAME="IDX65"></A>
<DT><CODE>d</CODE> (<CODE>dir-node</CODE>)
<DD>Selects the directory node (i.e., the node <SAMP>`(dir)'</SAMP>).
</DL>
<P>
Here are some other commands which immediately result in the selection
of a different node in the current window:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX66"></A>
<A NAME="IDX67"></A>
<DT><CODE>&#60;</CODE> (<CODE>first-node</CODE>)
<DD>Selects the first node which appears in this file.  This node is most
often <SAMP>`Top'</SAMP>, but it doesn't have to be.

<A NAME="IDX68"></A>
<A NAME="IDX69"></A>
<DT><CODE>&#62;</CODE> (<CODE>last-node</CODE>)
<DD>Selects the last node which appears in this file.

<A NAME="IDX70"></A>
<A NAME="IDX71"></A>
<DT><CODE>]</CODE> (<CODE>global-next-node</CODE>)
<DD>Moves forward or down through node structure.  If the node that you are
currently viewing has a <SAMP>`Next'</SAMP> pointer, that node is selected.
Otherwise, if this node has a menu, the first menu item is selected.  If
there is no <SAMP>`Next'</SAMP> and no menu, the same process is tried with the
<SAMP>`Up'</SAMP> node of this node.

<A NAME="IDX72"></A>
<A NAME="IDX73"></A>
<DT><CODE>[</CODE> (<CODE>global-prev-node</CODE>)
<DD>Moves backward or up through node structure.  If the node that you are
currently viewing has a <SAMP>`Prev'</SAMP> pointer, that node is selected.
Otherwise, if the node has an <SAMP>`Up'</SAMP> pointer, that node is selected,
and if it has a menu, the last item in the menu is selected.
</DL>
<P>
You can get the same behaviour as <CODE>global-next-node</CODE> and
<CODE>global-prev-node</CODE> while simply scrolling through the file with
<KBD>SPC</KBD> and <KBD>DEL</KBD>; See section <A HREF="infoman_17.html#SEC16">Manipulating Variables</A>, for
more information.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX74"></A>
<A NAME="IDX75"></A>
<DT><CODE>g</CODE> (<CODE>goto-node</CODE>)
<DD>Reads the name of a node and selects it.  No completion is done while
reading the node name, since the desired node may reside in a separate
file.  The node must be typed exactly as it appears in the info file.  A
file name may be included as with any node specification, for example

<PRE>
<CODE>g(emacs)Buffers</CODE>
</PRE>

finds the node <SAMP>`Buffers'</SAMP> in the info file <TT>`emacs'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX76"></A>
<A NAME="IDX77"></A>
<DT><CODE>C-x k</CODE> (<CODE>kill-node</CODE>)
<DD>Kills a node.  The node name is prompted for in the echo area, with a
default of the current node.  <DFN>Killing</DFN> a node means that Info tries
hard to forget about it, removing it from the list of history nodes kept
for the window where that node is found.  Another node is selected in
the window which contained the killed node.

<A NAME="IDX78"></A>
<A NAME="IDX79"></A>
<DT><CODE>C-x C-f</CODE> (<CODE>view-file</CODE>)
<DD>Reads the name of a file and selects the entire file.  The command
<PRE>
<CODE>C-x C-f <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
</PRE>
is equivalent to typing
<PRE>
<CODE>g(<VAR>filename</VAR>)*</CODE>
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX80"></A>
<A NAME="IDX81"></A>
<DT><CODE>C-x C-b</CODE> (<CODE>list-visited-nodes</CODE>)
<DD>Makes a window containing a menu of all of the currently visited nodes.
This window becomes the selected window, and you may use the standard
Info commands within it.

<A NAME="IDX82"></A>
<A NAME="IDX83"></A>
<DT><CODE>C-x b</CODE> (<CODE>select-visited-node</CODE>)
<DD>Selects a node which has been previously visited in a visible window.
This is similar to <SAMP>`C-x C-b'</SAMP> followed by <SAMP>`m'</SAMP>, but no window is
created.
