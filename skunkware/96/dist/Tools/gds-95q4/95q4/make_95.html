<P>
Suppose you are writing a pattern rule to compile a <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> file into a
<SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> file: how do you write the <SAMP>`cc'</SAMP> command so that it operates
on the right source file name?  You cannot write the name in the command,
because the name is different each time the implicit rule is applied.
<P>
What you do is use a special feature of <CODE>make</CODE>, the <DFN>automatic
variables</DFN>.  These variables have values computed afresh for each rule that
is executed, based on the target and dependencies of the rule.  In this
example, you would use <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP> for the object file name and <SAMP>`$&#60;'</SAMP>
for the source file name.
<P>
Here is a table of automatic variables:
<P>
<A NAME="IDX770"></A>
<A NAME="IDX771"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>$@</CODE>
<DD>The file name of the target of the rule.  If the target is an archive
member, then <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP> is the name of the archive file.  In a pattern
rule that has multiple targets (see section <A HREF="make_93.html#SEC92">Introduction to Pattern Rules</A>), <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP> is the name of whichever target caused the
rule's commands to be run.

<A NAME="IDX773"></A>
<A NAME="IDX772"></A>
<DT><CODE>$%</CODE>
<DD>The target member name, when the target is an archive member.
See section <A HREF="make_102.html#SEC101">Using <CODE>make</CODE> to Update Archive Files</A>.  For example, if the target is <TT>`foo.a(bar.o)'</TT> then
<SAMP>`$%'</SAMP> is <TT>`bar.o'</TT> and <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP> is <TT>`foo.a'</TT>.  <SAMP>`$%'</SAMP> is
empty when the target is not an archive member.

<A NAME="IDX775"></A>
<A NAME="IDX774"></A>
<DT><CODE>$&#60;</CODE>
<DD>The name of the first dependency.  If the target got its commands from
an implicit rule, this will be the first dependency added by the
implicit rule (see section <A HREF="make_87.html#SEC86">Using Implicit Rules</A>).

<A NAME="IDX777"></A>
<A NAME="IDX776"></A>
<DT><CODE>$?</CODE>
<DD>The names of all the dependencies that are newer than the target, with
spaces between them.  For dependencies which are archive members, only
the member named is used (see section <A HREF="make_102.html#SEC101">Using <CODE>make</CODE> to Update Archive Files</A>).
<A NAME="IDX779"></A>
<A NAME="IDX778"></A>

<A NAME="IDX781"></A>
<A NAME="IDX780"></A>
<DT><CODE>$^</CODE>
<DD>The names of all the dependencies, with spaces between them.  For
dependencies which are archive members, only the member named is used
(see section <A HREF="make_102.html#SEC101">Using <CODE>make</CODE> to Update Archive Files</A>).  A target has only one dependency on each other file
it depends on, no matter how many times each file is listed as a
dependency.  So if you list a dependency more than once for a target,
the value of <CODE>$^</CODE> contains just one copy of the name.
<A NAME="IDX783"></A>
<A NAME="IDX782"></A>

<A NAME="IDX785"></A>
<A NAME="IDX784"></A>
<DT><CODE>$+</CODE>
<DD>This is like <SAMP>`$^'</SAMP>, but dependencies listed more than once are
duplicated in the order they were listed in the makefile.  This is
primarily useful for use in linking commands where it is meaningful to
repeat library file names in a particular order.

<A NAME="IDX787"></A>
<A NAME="IDX786"></A>
<DT><CODE>$*</CODE>
<DD>The stem with which an implicit rule matches (see section <A HREF="make_96.html#SEC95">How Patterns Match</A>).  If the target is <TT>`dir/a.foo.b'</TT> and the target
pattern is <TT>`a.%.b'</TT> then the stem is <TT>`dir/foo'</TT>.  The stem is
useful for constructing names of related files.<A NAME="IDX788"></A>

In a static pattern rule, the stem is part of the file name that matched
the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> in the target pattern.

In an explicit rule, there is no stem; so <SAMP>`$*'</SAMP> cannot be determined
in that way.  Instead, if the target name ends with a recognized suffix
(see section <A HREF="make_100.html#SEC99">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</A>), <SAMP>`$*'</SAMP> is set to
the target name minus the suffix.  For example, if the target name is
<SAMP>`foo.c'</SAMP>, then <SAMP>`$*'</SAMP> is set to <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP>, since <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> is a
suffix.  GNU <CODE>make</CODE> does this bizarre thing only for compatibility
with other implementations of <CODE>make</CODE>.  You should generally avoid
using <SAMP>`$*'</SAMP> except in implicit rules or static pattern rules.
If the target name in an explicit rule does not end with a recognized
suffix, <SAMP>`$*'</SAMP> is set to the empty string for that rule.
</DL>
<P>
<SAMP>`$?'</SAMP> is useful even in explicit rules when you wish to operate on only
the dependencies that have changed.  For example, suppose that an archive
named <TT>`lib'</TT> is supposed to contain copies of several object files.
This rule copies just the changed object files into the archive:
<P>
<PRE>
lib: foo.o bar.o lose.o win.o
        ar r lib $?
</PRE>
<P>
Of the variables listed above, four have values that are single file
names, and two have values that are lists of file names.  These six have
variants that get just the file's directory name or just the file name
within the directory.  The variant variables' names are formed by
appending <SAMP>`D'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`F'</SAMP>, respectively.  These variants are
semi-obsolete in GNU <CODE>make</CODE> since the functions <CODE>dir</CODE> and
<CODE>notdir</CODE> can be used to get a similar effect (see section <A HREF="make_75.html#SEC74">Functions for File Names</A>).  Note, however, that the
<SAMP>`F'</SAMP> variants all omit the trailing slash which always appears in
the output of the <CODE>dir</CODE> function.  Here is a table of the variants:
<P>
<A NAME="IDX789"></A>
<A NAME="IDX790"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`$(@D)'</SAMP>
<DD>The directory part of the file name of the target, with the trailing
slash removed.  If the value of <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP> is <TT>`dir/foo.o'</TT> then
<SAMP>`$(@D)'</SAMP> is <TT>`dir'</TT>.  This value is <TT>`.'</TT> if <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP> does
not contain a slash.

<A NAME="IDX792"></A>
<A NAME="IDX791"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`$(@F)'</SAMP>
<DD>The file-within-directory part of the file name of the target.  If the
value of <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP> is <TT>`dir/foo.o'</TT> then <SAMP>`$(@F)'</SAMP> is
<TT>`foo.o'</TT>.  <SAMP>`$(@F)'</SAMP> is equivalent to <SAMP>`$(notdir $@)'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX794"></A>
<A NAME="IDX795"></A>
<A NAME="IDX796"></A>
<A NAME="IDX793"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`$(*D)'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`$(*F)'</SAMP>
<DD>The directory part and the file-within-directory
part of the stem; <TT>`dir'</TT> and <TT>`foo'</TT> in this example.

<A NAME="IDX798"></A>
<A NAME="IDX799"></A>
<A NAME="IDX800"></A>
<A NAME="IDX797"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`$(%D)'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`$(%F)'</SAMP>
<DD>The directory part and the file-within-directory part of the target
archive member name.  This makes sense only for archive member targets
of the form <TT>`<VAR>archive</VAR>(<VAR>member</VAR>)'</TT> and is useful only when
<VAR>member</VAR> may contain a directory name.  (See section <A HREF="make_103.html#SEC102">Archive Members as Targets</A>.)

<A NAME="IDX802"></A>
<A NAME="IDX803"></A>
<A NAME="IDX804"></A>
<A NAME="IDX801"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`$(&#60;D)'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`$(&#60;F)'</SAMP>
<DD>The directory part and the file-within-directory
part of the first dependency.

<A NAME="IDX806"></A>
<A NAME="IDX807"></A>
<A NAME="IDX808"></A>
<A NAME="IDX805"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`$(^D)'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`$(^F)'</SAMP>
<DD>Lists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory
parts of all dependencies.

<A NAME="IDX810"></A>
<A NAME="IDX811"></A>
<A NAME="IDX812"></A>
<A NAME="IDX809"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`$(?D)'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`$(?F)'</SAMP>
<DD>Lists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory parts of
all dependencies that are newer than the target.
</DL>
<P>
Note that we use a special stylistic convention when we talk about these
automatic variables; we write "the value of <SAMP>`$&#60;'</SAMP>", rather than
"the variable <CODE>&#60;</CODE>" as we would write for ordinary variables
such as <CODE>objects</CODE> and <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>.  We think this convention
looks more natural in this special case.  Please do not assume it has a
deep significance; <SAMP>`$&#60;'</SAMP> refers to the variable named <CODE>&#60;</CODE> just
as <SAMP>`$(CFLAGS)'</SAMP> refers to the variable named <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>.
You could just as well use <SAMP>`$(&#60;)'</SAMP> in place of <SAMP>`$&#60;'</SAMP>.
