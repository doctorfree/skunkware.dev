C++ templates are the first language feature to require more
intelligence from the environment than one usually finds on a UNIX
system.  Somehow the compiler and linker have to make sure that each
template instance occurs exactly once in the executable if it is needed,
and not at all otherwise.  There are two basic approaches to this
problem, which I will refer to as the Borland model and the Cfront model.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Borland model
<DD>Borland C++ solved the template instantiation problem by adding the code
equivalent of common blocks to their linker; template instances
are emitted in each translation unit that uses them, and they are
collapsed together at run time.  The advantage of this model is that the
linker only has to consider the object files themselves; there is no
external complexity to worry about.  This disadvantage is that
compilation time is increased because the template code is being
compiled repeatedly.  Code written for this model tends to include
definitions of all member templates in the header file, since they must
be seen to be compiled.

<DT>Cfront model
<DD>The AT&#38;T C++ translator, Cfront, solved the template instantiation
problem by creating the notion of a template repository, an
automatically maintained place where template instances are stored.  As
individual object files are built, notes are placed in the repository to
record where templates and potential type arguments were seen so that
the subsequent instantiation step knows where to find them.  At link
time, any needed instances are generated and linked in.  The advantages
of this model are more optimal compilation speed and the ability to use
the system linker; to implement the Borland model a compiler vendor also
needs to replace the linker.  The disadvantages are vastly increased
complexity, and thus potential for error; theoretically, this should be
just as transparent, but in practice it has been very difficult to build
multiple programs in one directory and one program in multiple
directories using Cfront.  Code written for this model tends to separate
definitions of non-inline member templates into a separate file, which
is magically found by the link preprocessor when a template needs to be
instantiated.
</DL>
<P>
Currently, you have four options for dealing with template instantiations:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Compile your template-using code with <SAMP>`-frepo'</SAMP>.  The compiler will
generate files with the extension <SAMP>`.rpo'</SAMP> listing all of the
template instantiations used in the corresponding object files which
could be instantiated there; the link wrapper, <SAMP>`collect2'</SAMP>, will
then update the <SAMP>`.rpo'</SAMP> files to tell the compiler where to place
those instantiations and rebuild any affected object files.  The
link-time overhead is negligible after the first pass, as the compiler
will continue to place the instantiations in the same files.

This is your best option for application code written for the Borland
model, as it will just work.  Code written for the Cfront model will
need to be modified so that the template definitions are available at
one or more points of instantiation; usually this is as simple as adding
<CODE>#include &#60;tmethods.cc&#62;</CODE> to the end of each template header.

For library code, if you want the library to provide all of the template
instantiations it needs, just try to link all of its object files
together; the link will fail, but cause the instantiations to be
generated as a side effect.  Be warned, however, that this may cause
conflicts if multiple libraries try to provide the same instantiations.
For greater control, use explicit instantiation as described in the next
option.

<LI>
Explicitly instantiate all the template instances you use, and compile
with -fno-implicit-templates.  This requires more knowledge of exactly
which templates you are using, but it's less mysterious than the
previous approach, and offers greater control.  You can scatter the
instantiations throughout your program, you can create one big file to
do all the instantiations, or you can create tiny files like

<PRE>
#include "Foo.h"
#include "Foo.cc"

template class Foo&#60;int&#62;;
template ostream&#38; operator &#60;&#60;
                (ostream&#38;, const Foo&#60;int&#62;&#38;);
</PRE>

for each instance you need, and create a template instantiation library
from those.  If you are using Cfront-model code, you can probably get
away with not using -fno-implicit-templates when compiling files that
don't <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> the member template definitions.

<LI>
Do nothing.  Pretend g++ does implement automatic instantiation
management.  Code written for the Borland model will work fine, but
each translation unit will contain instances of each of the templates it
uses.  In a large program, this can lead to an unacceptable amount of code
duplication; you should probably just use <SAMP>`-frepo'</SAMP>.

<LI>
Add <SAMP>`#pragma interface'</SAMP> to all files containing template
definitions.  For each of these files, add <SAMP>`#pragma implementation
"<VAR>filename</VAR>"'</SAMP> to the top of some <SAMP>`.C'</SAMP> file which
<SAMP>`#include'</SAMP>s it.  Then compile everything with -fexternal-templates.
The templates will then only be expanded in the translation unit which
implements them (i.e. has a <SAMP>`#pragma implementation'</SAMP> line for the
file where they live); all other files will use external references.  If
you're lucky, everything should work properly.  If you get undefined
symbol errors, you need to make sure that each template instance which
is used in the program is used in the file which implements that
template.  If you don't have any use for a particular instance in that
file, you can just instantiate it explicitly.

This strategy will work with code written for either model.  If you are
using code written for the Cfront model, the file containing a class
template and the file containing its member templates should be
implemented in the same translation unit.

A slight variation on this approach is to use the option
<SAMP>`-falt-external-templates'</SAMP> instead.  This option causes template
instances to be emitted in the translation unit that implements the
header where they are first instantiated, rather than the one which
implements the file where the templates are defined.  This header must
be the same in all translation units, or things are likely to break.

See section <A HREF="usegcc_106.html#SEC109">Declarations and Definitions in One Header</A>, for
more discussion of these pragmas.  Better yet, don't use this approach;
it is obsolete and only supported for backward compatibility.
