<P>
It can be convenient to view more than one node at a time.  To allow
this, Info can display more than one <DFN>window</DFN>.  Each window has its
own mode line (see section <A HREF="infoman_12.html#SEC11">The Mode Line</A>) and history of nodes viewed in that
window (see section <A HREF="infoman_6.html#SEC5">Selecting a New Node</A>).

<DT><CODE>C-x o</CODE> (<CODE>next-window</CODE>)
<DD>Selects the next window on the screen.  Note that the echo area can only be
selected if it is already in use, and you have left it temporarily.
Normally, <SAMP>`C-x o'</SAMP> simply moves the cursor into the next window on
the screen, or if you are already within the last window, into the first
window on the screen.  Given a numeric argument, <SAMP>`C-x o'</SAMP> moves over
that many windows.  A negative argument causes <SAMP>`C-x o'</SAMP> to select
the previous window on the screen.

<A NAME="IDX116"></A>
<DT><CODE>M-x prev-window</CODE>
<DD>Selects the previous window on the screen.  This is identical to
<SAMP>`C-x o'</SAMP> with a negative argument.

<A NAME="IDX117"></A>
<A NAME="IDX118"></A>
<A NAME="IDX119"></A>
<DT><CODE>C-x 2</CODE> (<CODE>split-window</CODE>)
<DD>Splits the current window into two windows, both showing the same node.
Each window is one half the size of the original window, and the cursor
remains in the original window.  The variable <CODE>automatic-tiling</CODE>
can cause all of the windows on the screen to be resized for you
automatically, please see section <A HREF="infoman_17.html#SEC16">Manipulating Variables</A> for more
information.

<A NAME="IDX120"></A>
<A NAME="IDX121"></A>
<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
<DT><CODE>C-x 0</CODE> (<CODE>delete-window</CODE>)
<DD>Deletes the current window from the screen.  If you have made too many
windows and your screen appears cluttered, this is the way to get rid of
some of them.

<A NAME="IDX123"></A>
<A NAME="IDX124"></A>
<DT><CODE>C-x 1</CODE> (<CODE>keep-one-window</CODE>)
<DD>Deletes all of the windows excepting the current one.

<A NAME="IDX125"></A>
<A NAME="IDX126"></A>
<DT><CODE>ESC C-v</CODE> (<CODE>scroll-other-window</CODE>)
<DD>Scrolls the other window, in the same fashion that <SAMP>`C-v'</SAMP> might
scroll the current window.  Given a negative argument, the "other"
window is scrolled backward.

<A NAME="IDX127"></A>
<A NAME="IDX128"></A>
<DT><CODE>C-x ^</CODE> (<CODE>grow-window</CODE>)
<DD>Grows (or shrinks) the current window.  Given a numeric argument, grows
the current window that many lines; with a negative numeric argument,
the window is shrunk instead.

<A NAME="IDX129"></A>
<A NAME="IDX130"></A>
<A NAME="IDX131"></A>
<DT><CODE>C-x t</CODE> (<CODE>tile-windows</CODE>)
<DD>Divides the available screen space among all of the visible windows.
Each window is given an equal portion of the screen in which to display
its contents.  The variable <CODE>automatic-tiling</CODE> can cause
<CODE>tile-windows</CODE> to be called when a window is created or deleted.
