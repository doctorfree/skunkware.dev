<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The <SAMP>`fixincludes'</SAMP> installation step described here <EM>applies
only to the native configuration</EM> of the Developer's Kit---that is, only
if your tape is configured to develop software for the same <DFN>host</DFN>
on which it runs.  If you have a cross-development tape, configured to
develop software for another machine (the <DFN>target</DFN>), the system
header files from your <DFN>host</DFN> are not needed for the GNU
compilers.  Cross-development tapes have <SAMP>`target = <VAR>target</VAR>'</SAMP> on
the tape label.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
For the native configuration, it is very important to run <SAMP>`Install
fixincludes'</SAMP> (on <EM>each host</EM> where you install the compiler
binaries).
<P>
When the ANSI X3J11 committee finished developing a standard for
the C language, a few things that had worked one way in many traditional
C compilers ended up working differently in ANSI C.  Most of these
changes are improvements.  But some Unix header files still rely on the
old C meanings, in cases where the Unix vendor has not yet converted to
using an ANSI C compiler for the operating system itself.
<SAMP>`Install fixincludes'</SAMP> does a mechanical translation that writes
ANSI C versions of some system header files into a new,
GCC-specific include directory---<EM>your system's original
header files are not affected.</EM>
<P>
The C header files supplied with SVr4 versions of Unix depend on a
questionable interpretation of the ANSI C standard: they test for a
non-ANSI environment by checking whether <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> is
defined as zero.  The ANSI standard actually only specifies that
<CODE>__STDC__</CODE> be defined to 1; if it is defined to any other value,
the environment is not ANSI C compatible, and ANSI C says
nothing about what that value might be.
<P>
GCC defines <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> to 1 when running with <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>,
when it functions as an "ANSI C superset" compiler.  (It also
sets <CODE>__STRICT_ANSI__</CODE> when it runs with the <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP>
option.)  However, GCC leaves <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> undefined when it is
not running as an ANSI C compiler.
<P>
Unfortunately for Solaris users, Solaris header files follow the SVr4
choice.  Since GCC never defines <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> as 0, the
distributed header files can leave out some declarations.  (Look in
<TT>`/usr/include/time.h'</TT>, for example.)
<P>
Part of the installation process of the native compiler release is to
"fix" the header files, such as <TT>`stdio.h'</TT>, on the host system to
remove ANSI incompatibilities.  <SAMP>`Install fixincludes'</SAMP> makes
copies of the system <TT>`include'</TT> files which have these nonstandard
features removed, so that GCC can process them.  These copies are
placed in a new, GCC-specific <TT>`include'</TT> directory---<EM>your
system's original header files are not affected.</EM> Once these fixed
header files are created, GCC finds and uses them automatically.
<P>
Likewise, C++ programmers require C++-ready, ANSI-compatible
versions of the standard C header files.  These used to be provided with
<CODE>libg++</CODE>, but were difficult to maintain due to the design
compromises (and outright "kludges") that were necessary to make these
work on all the systems we support.
<P>
We have recently introduced what we believe to be a better solution in
the form of a new shell script, <CODE>fixproto</CODE>.  <CODE>fixproto</CODE>
analyzes all the header files in <TT>`/usr/include'</TT>, and adds any
missing standard ANSI and Posix.2 prototypes.  The <SAMP>`extern
"C"'</SAMP> braces needed to specify that these are C (not C++) functions are
also added as needed.  It is run as part of the installation and/or
build of a native compiler.  The resulting header files are also used
for C, with the result that the <SAMP>`-Wimplicit'</SAMP> option for <CODE>gcc</CODE>
is much more useful.
<P>
The most obvious drawback to this solution is that the process of
"fixing" the <TT>`include'</TT> files takes longer to run, so any
installation of a native compiler is noticeably slower than in previous
releases.  Performance improvements will be made as part of a future
release.
<P>
If you don't run <CODE>fixincludes</CODE>, the GNU C compiler can only
use the original system header files when you compile new C programs.
<EM>In some cases, the resulting programs will fail at run-time.</EM>
