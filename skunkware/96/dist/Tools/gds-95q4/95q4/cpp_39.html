<P>
This section describes three additional preprocessing directives.  They are
not very useful, but are mentioned for completeness.
<P>
The <DFN>null directive</DFN> consists of a <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> followed by a Newline, with
only whitespace (including comments) in between.  A null directive is
understood as a preprocessing directive but has no effect on the preprocessor
output.  The primary significance of the existence of the null directive is
that an input line consisting of just a <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> will produce no output,
rather than a line of output containing just a <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>.  Supposedly
some old C programs contain such lines.
<A NAME="IDX96"></A>
<P>
The ANSI standard specifies that the <SAMP>`#pragma'</SAMP> directive has an
arbitrary, implementation-defined effect.  In the GNU C preprocessor,
<SAMP>`#pragma'</SAMP> directives are not used, except for <SAMP>`#pragma once'</SAMP>
(see section <A HREF="cpp_7.html#SEC8">Once-Only Include Files</A>).  However, they are left in the preprocessor output,
so they are available to the compilation pass.
<A NAME="IDX97"></A>
<P>
The <SAMP>`#ident'</SAMP> directive is supported for compatibility with certain
other systems.  It is followed by a line of text.  On some systems, the
text is copied into a special place in the object file; on most systems,
the text is ignored and this directive has no effect.  Typically
<SAMP>`#ident'</SAMP> is only used in header files supplied with those systems
where it is meaningful.
