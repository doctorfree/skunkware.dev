<P>
GNU <CODE>as</CODE> is really a family of assemblers.
If you use (or have used) the GNU assembler on one architecture, you
should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another
architecture.  Each version has much in common with the others,
including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called
<DFN>pseudo-ops</DFN>) and assembler syntax.<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
<P>
<CODE>as</CODE> is primarily intended to assemble the output of the
GNU C compiler <CODE>gcc</CODE> for use by the linker
<CODE>ld</CODE>.  Nevertheless, we've tried to make <CODE>as</CODE>
assemble correctly everything that other assemblers for the same
machine would assemble.
Any exceptions are documented explicitly (see section <A HREF="as_126.html#SEC128">Machine Dependent Features</A>).
This doesn't mean <CODE>as</CODE> always uses the same syntax as another
assembler for the same architecture; for example, we know of several
incompatible versions of 680x0 assembly language syntax.
<P>
Unlike older assemblers, <CODE>as</CODE> is designed to assemble a source
program in one pass of the source file.  This has a subtle impact on the
<KBD>.org</KBD> directive (see section <A HREF="as_104.html#SEC106"><CODE>.org <VAR>new-lc</CODE> , <VAR>fill</VAR></VAR></A>).
