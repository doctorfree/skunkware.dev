<P>
Variable-length automatic arrays are allowed in GNU C.  These arrays are
declared like any other automatic arrays, but with a length that is not
a constant expression.  The storage is allocated at the point of
declaration and deallocated when the brace-level is exited.  For
example:
<P>
<PRE>
FILE *
concat_fopen (char *s1, char *s2, char *mode)
{
  char str[strlen (s1) + strlen (s2) + 1];
  strcpy (str, s1);
  strcat (str, s2);
  return fopen (str, mode);
}
</PRE>
<A NAME="IDX297"></A>
<A NAME="IDX298"></A>
<A NAME="IDX299"></A>
<P>
Jumping or breaking out of the scope of the array name deallocates the
storage.  Jumping into the scope is not allowed; you get an error
message for it.
<A NAME="IDX300"></A>
<P>
You can use the function <CODE>alloca</CODE> to get an effect much like
variable-length arrays.  The function <CODE>alloca</CODE> is available in
many other C implementations (but not in all).  On the other hand,
variable-length arrays are more elegant.
<P>
There are other differences between these two methods.  Space allocated
with <CODE>alloca</CODE> exists until the containing <EM>function</EM> returns.
The space for a variable-length array is deallocated as soon as the array
name's scope ends.  (If you use both variable-length arrays and
<CODE>alloca</CODE> in the same function, deallocation of a variable-length array
will also deallocate anything more recently allocated with <CODE>alloca</CODE>.)
<P>
You can also use variable-length arrays as arguments to functions:
<P>
<PRE>
struct entry
tester (int len, char data[len][len])
{
  ...
}
</PRE>
<P>
The length of an array is computed once when the storage is allocated
and is remembered for the scope of the array in case you access it with
<CODE>sizeof</CODE>.
<P>
If you want to pass the array first and the length afterward, you can
use a forward declaration in the parameter list--another GNU extension.
<P>
<PRE>
struct entry
tester (int len; char data[len][len], int len)
{
  ...
}
</PRE>
<A NAME="IDX301"></A>
<P>
The <SAMP>`int len'</SAMP> before the semicolon is a <DFN>parameter forward
declaration</DFN>, and it serves the purpose of making the name <CODE>len</CODE>
known when the declaration of <CODE>data</CODE> is parsed.
<P>
You can write any number of such parameter forward declarations in the
parameter list.  They can be separated by commas or semicolons, but the
last one must end with a semicolon, which is followed by the "real"
parameter declarations.  Each forward declaration must match a "real"
declaration in parameter name and data type.
