<H2><A NAME="SEC106" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC106">Suffix Rules for Archive Files</A></H2>
<P>
You can write a special kind of suffix rule for dealing with archive
files.  See section <A HREF="make_100.html#SEC99">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</A>, for a full explanation of suffix rules.
Archive suffix rules are obsolete in GNU <CODE>make</CODE>, because pattern
rules for archives are a more general mechanism (see section <A HREF="make_104.html#SEC103">Implicit Rule for Archive Member Targets</A>).  But they are retained for compatibility with other
<CODE>make</CODE>s.
<P>
To write a suffix rule for archives, you simply write a suffix rule
using the target suffix <SAMP>`.a'</SAMP> (the usual suffix for archive files).
For example, here is the old-fashioned suffix rule to update a library
archive from C source files:
<P>
<PRE>
.c.a:
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $&#60; -o $*.o
        $(AR) r $@ $*.o
        $(RM) $*.o
</PRE>
<P>
This works just as if you had written the pattern rule:
<P>
<PRE>
(%.o): %.c
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $&#60; -o $*.o
        $(AR) r $@ $*.o
        $(RM) $*.o
</PRE>
<P>
In fact, this is just what <CODE>make</CODE> does when it sees a suffix rule
with <SAMP>`.a'</SAMP> as the target suffix.  Any double-suffix rule
<SAMP>`.<VAR>x</VAR>.a'</SAMP> is converted to a pattern rule with the target
pattern <SAMP>`(%.o)'</SAMP> and a dependency pattern of <SAMP>`%.<VAR>x</VAR>'</SAMP>.
<P>
Since you might want to use <SAMP>`.a'</SAMP> as the suffix for some other kind
of file, <CODE>make</CODE> also converts archive suffix rules to pattern rules
in the normal way (see section <A HREF="make_100.html#SEC99">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</A>).  Thus a double-suffix rule
<SAMP>`.<VAR>x</VAR>.a'</SAMP> produces two pattern rules: <SAMP>`(%.o):
%.<VAR>x</VAR>'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`%.a: %.<VAR>x</VAR>'</SAMP>.<P>
