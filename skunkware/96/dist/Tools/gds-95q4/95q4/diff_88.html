<TITLE>Comparing and Merging Files - Unusual File Names</TITLE>

<H3><A NAME="SEC88" HREF="diff_toc.html#TOC88">File Names that Contain Unusual Characters</A></H3>
<P>
When a file name contains an unusual character like a newline or
white space, <SAMP>`diff -r'</SAMP> generates a patch that <CODE>patch</CODE> cannot
parse.  The problem is with format of <CODE>diff</CODE> output, not just with
<CODE>patch</CODE>, because with odd enough file names one can cause
<CODE>diff</CODE> to generate a patch that is syntactically correct but
patches the wrong files.  The format of <CODE>diff</CODE> output should be
extended to handle all possible file names.
