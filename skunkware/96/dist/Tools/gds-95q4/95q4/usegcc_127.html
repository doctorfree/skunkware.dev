<H2><A NAME="SEC130" HREF="usegcc_toc.html#TOC130">Certain Changes We Don't Want to Make</A></H2>
<P>
This section lists changes that people frequently request, but which
we do not make because we think GNU CC is better without them.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Checking the number and type of arguments to a function which has an
old-fashioned definition and no prototype.

Such a feature would work only occasionally--only for calls that appear
in the same file as the called function, following the definition.  The
only way to check all calls reliably is to add a prototype for the
function.  But adding a prototype eliminates the motivation for this
feature.  So the feature is not worthwhile.

<LI>
Warning about using an expression whose type is signed as a shift count.

Shift count operands are probably signed more often than unsigned.
Warning about this would cause far more annoyance than good.

<LI>
Warning about assigning a signed value to an unsigned variable.

Such assignments must be very common; warning about them would cause
more annoyance than good.

<LI>
Warning about unreachable code.

It's very common to have unreachable code in machine-generated
programs.  For example, this happens normally in some files of GNU C
itself.

<LI>
Warning when a non-void function value is ignored.

Coming as I do from a Lisp background, I balk at the idea that there is
something dangerous about discarding a value.  There are functions that
return values which some callers may find useful; it makes no sense to
clutter the program with a cast to <CODE>void</CODE> whenever the value isn't
useful.

<LI>
Assuming (for optimization) that the address of an external symbol is
never zero.

This assumption is false on certain systems when <SAMP>`#pragma weak'</SAMP> is
used.

<LI>
Making <SAMP>`-fshort-enums'</SAMP> the default.

This would cause storage layout to be incompatible with most other C
compilers.  And it doesn't seem very important, given that you can get
the same result in other ways.  The case where it matters most is when
the enumeration-valued object is inside a structure, and in that case
you can specify a field width explicitly.

<LI>
Making bitfields unsigned by default on particular machines where "the
ABI standard" says to do so.

The ANSI C standard leaves it up to the implementation whether a bitfield
declared plain <CODE>int</CODE> is signed or not.  This in effect creates two
alternative dialects of C.

The GNU C compiler supports both dialects; you can specify the signed
dialect with <SAMP>`-fsigned-bitfields'</SAMP> and the unsigned dialect with
<SAMP>`-funsigned-bitfields'</SAMP>.  However, this leaves open the question of
which dialect to use by default.

Currently, the preferred dialect makes plain bitfields signed, because
this is simplest.  Since <CODE>int</CODE> is the same as <CODE>signed int</CODE> in
every other context, it is cleanest for them to be the same in bitfields
as well.

Some computer manufacturers have published Application Binary Interface
standards which specify that plain bitfields should be unsigned.  It is
a mistake, however, to say anything about this issue in an ABI.  This is
because the handling of plain bitfields distinguishes two dialects of C.
Both dialects are meaningful on every type of machine.  Whether a
particular object file was compiled using signed bitfields or unsigned
is of no concern to other object files, even if they access the same
bitfields in the same data structures.

A given program is written in one or the other of these two dialects.
The program stands a chance to work on most any machine if it is
compiled with the proper dialect.  It is unlikely to work at all if
compiled with the wrong dialect.

Many users appreciate the GNU C compiler because it provides an
environment that is uniform across machines.  These users would be
inconvenienced if the compiler treated plain bitfields differently on
certain machines.

Occasionally users write programs intended only for a particular machine
type.  On these occasions, the users would benefit if the GNU C compiler
were to support by default the same dialect as the other compilers on
that machine.  But such applications are rare.  And users writing a
program to run on more than one type of machine cannot possibly benefit
from this kind of compatibility.

This is why GNU CC does and will treat plain bitfields in the same
fashion on all types of machines (by default).

There are some arguments for making bitfields unsigned by default on all
machines.  If, for example, this becomes a universal de facto standard,
it would make sense for GNU CC to go along with it.  This is something
to be considered in the future.

(Of course, users strongly concerned about portability should indicate
explicitly in each bitfield whether it is signed or not.  In this way,
they write programs which have the same meaning in both C dialects.)

<LI>
Undefining <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> when <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> is not used.

Currently, GNU CC defines <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> as long as you don't use
<SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP>.  This provides good results in practice.

Programmers normally use conditionals on <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> to ask whether
it is safe to use certain features of ANSI C, such as function
prototypes or ANSI token concatenation.  Since plain <SAMP>`gcc'</SAMP> supports
all the features of ANSI C, the correct answer to these questions is
"yes".

Some users try to use <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> to check for the availability of
certain library facilities.  This is actually incorrect usage in an ANSI
C program, because the ANSI C standard says that a conforming
freestanding implementation should define <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> even though it
does not have the library facilities.  <SAMP>`gcc -ansi -pedantic'</SAMP> is a
conforming freestanding implementation, and it is therefore required to
define <CODE>__STDC__</CODE>, even though it does not come with an ANSI C
library.

Sometimes people say that defining <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> in a compiler that
does not completely conform to the ANSI C standard somehow violates the
standard.  This is illogical.  The standard is a standard for compilers
that claim to support ANSI C, such as <SAMP>`gcc -ansi'</SAMP>---not for other
compilers such as plain <SAMP>`gcc'</SAMP>.  Whatever the ANSI C standard says
is relevant to the design of plain <SAMP>`gcc'</SAMP> without <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> only
for pragmatic reasons, not as a requirement.

<LI>
Undefining <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> in C++.

Programs written to compile with C++-to-C translators get the
value of <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> that goes with the C compiler that is
subsequently used.  These programs must test <CODE>__STDC__</CODE>
to determine what kind of C preprocessor that compiler uses:
whether they should concatenate tokens in the ANSI C fashion
or in the traditional fashion.

These programs work properly with GNU C++ if <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> is defined.
They would not work otherwise.

In addition, many header files are written to provide prototypes in ANSI
C but not in traditional C.  Many of these header files can work without
change in C++ provided <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> is defined.  If <CODE>__STDC__</CODE>
is not defined, they will all fail, and will all need to be changed to
test explicitly for C++ as well.

<LI>
Deleting "empty" loops.

GNU CC does not delete "empty" loops because the most likely reason
you would put one in a program is to have a delay.  Deleting them will
not make real programs run any faster, so it would be pointless.

It would be different if optimization of a nonempty loop could produce
an empty one.  But this generally can't happen.

<LI>
Making side effects happen in the same order as in some other compiler.

<A NAME="IDX541"></A>
<A NAME="IDX540"></A>
It is never safe to depend on the order of evaluation of side effects.
For example, a function call like this may very well behave differently
from one compiler to another:

<PRE>
void func (int, int);

int i = 2;
func (i++, i++);
</PRE>

There is no guarantee (in either the C or the C++ standard language
definitions) that the increments will be evaluated in any particular
order.  Either increment might happen first.  <CODE>func</CODE> might get the
arguments <SAMP>`2, 3'</SAMP>, or it might get <SAMP>`3, 2'</SAMP>, or even <SAMP>`2, 2'</SAMP>.

<LI>
Not allowing structures with volatile fields in registers.

Strictly speaking, there is no prohibition in the ANSI C standard
against allowing structures with volatile fields in registers, but
it does not seem to make any sense and is probably not what you wanted
to do.  So the compiler will give an error message in this case.
