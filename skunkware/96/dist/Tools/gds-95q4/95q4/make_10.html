<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC9">Letting <CODE>make</CODE> Deduce the Commands</A></H2>
<P>
It is not necessary to spell out the commands for compiling the individual
C source files, because <CODE>make</CODE> can figure them out: it has an
<DFN>implicit rule</DFN> for updating a <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> file from a correspondingly
named <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> file using a <SAMP>`cc -c'</SAMP> command.  For example, it will
use the command <SAMP>`cc -c main.c -o main.o'</SAMP> to compile <TT>`main.c'</TT> into
<TT>`main.o'</TT>.  We can therefore omit the commands from the rules for the
object files.  See section <A HREF="make_87.html#SEC86">Using Implicit Rules</A>.<P>
When a <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> file is used automatically in this way, it is also
automatically added to the list of dependencies.  We can therefore omit
the <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> files from the dependencies, provided we omit the commands.
<P>
Here is the entire example, with both of these changes, and a variable
<CODE>objects</CODE> as suggested above:
<P>
<PRE>
objects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
          insert.o search.o files.o utils.o

edit : $(objects)
        cc -o edit $(objects)

main.o : defs.h
kbd.o : defs.h command.h
command.o : defs.h command.h
display.o : defs.h buffer.h
insert.o : defs.h buffer.h
search.o : defs.h buffer.h
files.o : defs.h buffer.h command.h
utils.o : defs.h

.PHONY : clean
clean :
        -rm edit $(objects)
</PRE>
<P>
This is how we would write the makefile in actual practice.  (The
complications associated with <SAMP>`clean'</SAMP> are described elsewhere.
See section <A HREF="make_32.html#SEC31">Phony Targets</A>, and section <A HREF="make_47.html#SEC46">Errors in Commands</A>.)
<P>
Because implicit rules are so convenient, they are important.  You
will see them used frequently.<P>
