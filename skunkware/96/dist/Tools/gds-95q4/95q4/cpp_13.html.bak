<H4><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="cpp_toc.html#TOC14">Standard Predefined Macros</A></H4>
<P>
The standard predefined macros are available with the same meanings
regardless of the machine or operating system on which you are using GNU C.
Their names all start and end with double underscores.  Those preceding
<CODE>__GNUC__</CODE> in this table are standardized by ANSI C; the rest are
GNU C extensions.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>__FILE__</CODE>
<DD>This macro expands to the name of the current input file, in the form of
a C string constant.  The precise name returned is the one that was
specified in <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> or as the input file name argument.

<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
<DT><CODE>__LINE__</CODE>
<DD>This macro expands to the current input line number, in the form of a
decimal integer constant.  While we call it a predefined macro, it's
a pretty strange macro, since its "definition" changes with each
new line of source code.

This and <SAMP>`__FILE__'</SAMP> are useful in generating an error message to
report an inconsistency detected by the program; the message can state
the source line at which the inconsistency was detected.  For example,

<PRE>
fprintf (stderr, "Internal error: "
                 "negative string length "
                 "%d at %s, line %d.",
         length, __FILE__, __LINE__);
</PRE>

A <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> directive changes the expansions of <SAMP>`__FILE__'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`__LINE__'</SAMP> to correspond to the included file.  At the end of
that file, when processing resumes on the input file that contained
the <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> directive, the expansions of <SAMP>`__FILE__'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`__LINE__'</SAMP> revert to the values they had before the
<SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> (but <SAMP>`__LINE__'</SAMP> is then incremented by one as
processing moves to the line after the <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP>).

The expansions of both <SAMP>`__FILE__'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`__LINE__'</SAMP> are altered
if a <SAMP>`#line'</SAMP> directive is used.  See section <A HREF="cpp_38.html#SEC39">Combining Source Files</A>.

<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
<DT><CODE>__DATE__</CODE>
<DD>This macro expands to a string constant that describes the date on
which the preprocessor is being run.  The string constant contains
eleven characters and looks like <SAMP>`"Jan 29 1987"'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`"Apr
1 1905"'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
<DT><CODE>__TIME__</CODE>
<DD>This macro expands to a string constant that describes the time at
which the preprocessor is being run.  The string constant contains
eight characters and looks like <SAMP>`"23:59:01"'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
<DT><CODE>__STDC__</CODE>
<DD>This macro expands to the constant 1, to signify that this is ANSI
Standard C.  (Whether that is actually true depends on what C compiler
will operate on the output from the preprocessor.)

<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
<DT><CODE>__STDC_VERSION__</CODE>
<DD>This macro expands to the C Standard's version number,
a long integer constant of the form <SAMP>`<VAR>yyyy</VAR><VAR>mm</VAR>L'</SAMP>
where <VAR>yyyy</VAR> and <VAR>mm</VAR> are the year and month of the Standard version.
This signifies which version of the C Standard the preprocessor conforms to.
Like <SAMP>`__STDC__'</SAMP>, whether this version number is accurate
for the entire implementation depends on what C compiler
will operate on the output from the preprocessor.

<A NAME="IDX30"></A>
<DT><CODE>__GNUC__</CODE>
<DD>This macro is defined if and only if this is GNU C.  This macro is
defined only when the entire GNU C compiler is in use; if you invoke the
preprocessor directly, <SAMP>`__GNUC__'</SAMP> is undefined.  The value
identifies the major version number of GNU CC (<SAMP>`1'</SAMP> for GNU CC
version 1, which is now obsolete, and <SAMP>`2'</SAMP> for version 2).

<A NAME="IDX31"></A>
<DT><CODE>__GNUC_MINOR__</CODE>
<DD>The macro contains the minor version number of the compiler.  This can
be used to work around differences between different releases of the
compiler (for example, if <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.6.3 is known to support a feature, you
can test for <CODE>__GNUC__ &#62; 2 || (__GNUC__ == 2 &#38;&#38; __GNUC_MINOR__ &#62;= 6)</CODE>).
The last number, <SAMP>`3'</SAMP> in the
example above, denotes the bugfix level of the compiler; no macro
contains this value.

<A NAME="IDX32"></A>
<DT><CODE>__GNUG__</CODE>
<DD>The GNU C compiler defines this when the compilation language is
C++; use <SAMP>`__GNUG__'</SAMP> to distinguish between GNU C and GNU
C++.

<A NAME="IDX33"></A>
<DT><CODE>__cplusplus</CODE>
<DD>The draft ANSI standard for C++ used to require predefining this
variable.  Though it is no longer required, GNU C++ continues to define
it, as do other popular C++ compilers.  You can use <SAMP>`__cplusplus'</SAMP>
to test whether a header is compiled by a C compiler or a C++ compiler.

<A NAME="IDX34"></A>
<DT><CODE>__STRICT_ANSI__</CODE>
<DD>This macro is defined if and only if the <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> switch was
specified when GNU C was invoked.  Its definition is the null string.
This macro exists primarily to direct certain GNU header files not to
define certain traditional Unix constructs which are incompatible with
ANSI C.

<A NAME="IDX35"></A>
<DT><CODE>__BASE_FILE__</CODE>
<DD>This macro expands to the name of the main input file, in the form
of a C string constant.  This is the source file that was specified
as an argument when the C compiler was invoked.

<A NAME="IDX36"></A>
<DT><CODE>__INCLUDE_LEVEL__</CODE>
<DD>This macro expands to a decimal integer constant that represents the
depth of nesting in include files.  The value of this macro is
incremented on every <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> directive and decremented at every
end of file.  For input files specified by command line arguments,
the nesting level is zero.

<A NAME="IDX37"></A>
<DT><CODE>__VERSION__</CODE>
<DD>This macro expands to a string which describes the version number of
GNU C.  The string is normally a sequence of decimal numbers separated
by periods, such as <SAMP>`"2.6.0"'</SAMP>.  The only reasonable use of this
macro is to incorporate it into a string constant.

<A NAME="IDX38"></A>
<DT><CODE>__OPTIMIZE__</CODE>
<DD>This macro is defined in optimizing compilations.  It causes certain
GNU header files to define alternative macro definitions for some
system library functions.  It is unwise to refer to or test the
definition of this macro unless you make very sure that programs will
execute with the same effect regardless.

<A NAME="IDX39"></A>
<DT><CODE>__CHAR_UNSIGNED__</CODE>
<DD>This macro is defined if and only if the data type <CODE>char</CODE> is
unsigned on the target machine.  It exists to cause the standard
header file <TT>`limit.h'</TT> to work correctly.  It is bad practice
to refer to this macro yourself; instead, refer to the standard
macros defined in <TT>`limit.h'</TT>.  The preprocessor uses
this macro to determine whether or not to sign-extend large character
constants written in octal; see section <A HREF="cpp_31.html#SEC32">The <SAMP>`#if'</SAMP> Directive</A>.

<A NAME="IDX40"></A>
<DT><CODE>__REGISTER_PREFIX__</CODE>
<DD>This macro expands to a string describing the prefix applied to cpu
registers in assembler code.  It can be used to write assembler code
that is usable in multiple environments.  For example, in the
<SAMP>`m68k-aout'</SAMP> environment it expands to the string <SAMP>`""'</SAMP>,
but in the <SAMP>`m68k-coff'</SAMP> environment it expands to the string
<SAMP>`"%"'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX41"></A>
<DT><CODE>__USER_LABEL_PREFIX__</CODE>
<DD>This macro expands to a string describing the prefix applied to
user generated labels in assembler code.  It can be used to write
assembler code that is usable in multiple environments.
For example, in the <SAMP>`m68k-aout'</SAMP> environment it expands to the
string <SAMP>`"_"'</SAMP>, but in the <SAMP>`m68k-coff'</SAMP> environment it expands
to the string <SAMP>`""'</SAMP>.
