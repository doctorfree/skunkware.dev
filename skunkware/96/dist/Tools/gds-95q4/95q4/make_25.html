<P>
Wildcard expansion happens automatically in rules.  But wildcard expansion
does not normally take place when a variable is set, or inside the
arguments of a function.  If you want to do wildcard expansion in such
places, you need to use the <CODE>wildcard</CODE> function, like this:
<P>
<PRE>
$(wildcard <VAR>pattern</VAR>...)
</PRE>
<P>
This string, used anywhere in a makefile, is replaced by a
space-separated list of names of existing files that match one of the
given file name patterns.  If no existing file name matches a pattern,
then that pattern is omitted from the output of the <CODE>wildcard</CODE>
function.  Note that this is different from how unmatched wildcards
behave in rules, where they are used verbatim rather than ignored
(see section <A HREF="make_24.html#SEC23">Pitfalls of Using Wildcards</A>).
<P>
One use of the <CODE>wildcard</CODE> function is to get a list of all the C source
files in a directory, like this:
<P>
<PRE>
$(wildcard *.c)
</PRE>
<P>
We can change the list of C source files into a list of object files by
replacing the <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> suffix with <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> in the result, like this:
<P>
<PRE>
$(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c))
</PRE>
<P>
(Here we have used another function, <CODE>patsubst</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="make_74.html#SEC73">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</A>.)<P>
Thus, a makefile to compile all C source files in the directory and then
link them together could be written as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
objects := $(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c))

foo : $(objects)
        cc -o foo $(objects)
</PRE>
<P>
(This takes advantage of the implicit rule for compiling C programs, so
there is no need to write explicit rules for compiling the files.
See section <A HREF="make_58.html#SEC57">The Two Flavors of Variables</A>, for an explanation of
<SAMP>`:='</SAMP>, which is a variant of <SAMP>`='</SAMP>.)
