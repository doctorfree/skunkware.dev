<P>
<CODE>diff</CODE> can produce output that is like an <CODE>ed</CODE> script, but
with hunks in forward (front to back) order.  The format of the commands
is also changed slightly: command characters precede the lines they
modify, spaces separate line numbers in ranges, and no attempt is made
to disambiguate hunk lines consisting of a single period.  Like
<CODE>ed</CODE> format, forward <CODE>ed</CODE> format cannot represent incomplete
lines.
<P>
Forward <CODE>ed</CODE> format is not very useful, because neither <CODE>ed</CODE>
nor <CODE>patch</CODE> can apply diffs in this format.  It exists mainly for
compatibility with older versions of <CODE>diff</CODE>.  Use the <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--forward-ed'</SAMP> option to select it.
