<P>
Header files serve two kinds of purposes.

<LI>
System header files declare the interfaces to parts of the operating
system.  You include them in your program to supply the definitions and
declarations you need to invoke system calls and libraries.

<LI>
Your own header files contain declarations for interfaces between the
source files of your program.  Each time you have a group of related
declarations and macro definitions all or most of which are needed in
several different source files, it is a good idea to create a header
file for them.
</UL>
<P>
Including a header file produces the same results in C compilation as
copying the header file into each source file that needs it.  But such
copying would be time-consuming and error-prone.  With a header file, the
related declarations appear in only one place.  If they need to be changed,
they can be changed in one place, and programs that include the header file
will automatically use the new version when next recompiled.  The header
file eliminates the labor of finding and changing all the copies as well as
the risk that a failure to find one copy will result in inconsistencies
within a program.
<P>
The usual convention is to give header files names that end with
<TT>`.h'</TT>.  Avoid unusual characters in header file names, as they
reduce portability.
