<P>
You can use predefined symbols of the form <SAMP>`r<VAR>n</VAR>h'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`r<VAR>n</VAR>l'</SAMP> to refer to the H8/300 registers as sixteen 8-bit
general-purpose registers.  <VAR>n</VAR> is a digit from <SAMP>`0'</SAMP> to
<SAMP>`7'</SAMP>); for instance, both <SAMP>`r0h'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`r7l'</SAMP> are valid
register names.
<P>
You can also use the eight predefined symbols <SAMP>`r<VAR>n</VAR>'</SAMP> to refer
to the H8/300 registers as 16-bit registers (you must use this form for
addressing).
<P>
On the H8/300H, you can also use the eight predefined symbols
<SAMP>`er<VAR>n</VAR>'</SAMP> (<SAMP>`er0'</SAMP> ... <SAMP>`er7'</SAMP>) to refer to the 32-bit
general purpose registers.
<P>
The two control registers are called <CODE>pc</CODE> (program counter; a
16-bit register, except on the H8/300H where it is 24 bits) and
<CODE>ccr</CODE> (condition code register; an 8-bit register).  <CODE>r7</CODE> is
used as the stack pointer, and can also be called <CODE>sp</CODE>.
