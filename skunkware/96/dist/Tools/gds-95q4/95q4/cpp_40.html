<P>
The output from the C preprocessor looks much like the input, except
that all preprocessing directive lines have been replaced with blank lines
and all comments with spaces.  Whitespace within a line is not altered;
however, a space is inserted after the expansions of most macro calls.
<P>
Source file name and line number information is conveyed by lines of
the form
<P>
<PRE>
# <VAR>linenum</VAR> <VAR>filename</VAR> <VAR>flags</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
which are inserted as needed into the middle of the input (but never
within a string or character constant).  Such a line means that the
following line originated in file <VAR>filename</VAR> at line <VAR>linenum</VAR>.
<P>
After the file name comes zero or more flags, which are <SAMP>`1'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`2'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`3'</SAMP>.  If there are multiple flags, spaces separate
them.  Here is what the flags mean:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`1'</SAMP>
<DD>This indicates the start of a new file.
<DT><SAMP>`2'</SAMP>
<DD>This indicates returning to a file (after having included another file).
<DT><SAMP>`3'</SAMP>
<DD>This indicates that the following text comes from a system header file,
so certain warnings should be suppressed.
