<H2><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="rebuilding_toc.html#SEC19">How your Developer's Kit was built</A></H2>

<P>
The files in your Developer's Kit distribution are compiled with the
following options to <CODE>configure</CODE> (the line is only split so that it
fits on the printed page; it is intended as a single command line):

</P>

<PRE>
configure --prefix=/usr/cygnus/progressive-<VAR>release</VAR> \
 --exec-prefix=/usr/cygnus/progressive-<VAR>release</VAR>/H-<VAR>hosttype</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>release</VAR> indicates the Cygnus release number for this
distribution, e.g., <SAMP>`94q4'</SAMP>, and <VAR>hosttype</VAR> indicates the
architecture and operating system configuration on which this software
is to run, e.g., <SAMP>`sparc-sun-sunos4.1.3'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="rebuilding_5.html#SEC4">Host names</A>).  Cross-development distributions are configured
with

</P>

<PRE>
configure --prefix=/usr/cygnus/progressive-<VAR>release</VAR> \
 --exec-prefix=/usr/cygnus/progressive-<VAR>release</VAR>/H-<VAR>hosttype</VAR> \
 --target=<VAR>target</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>target</VAR> indicates the architecture and object file format for
which the Developer's Kit is to generate code 
(see section <A HREF="rebuilding_6.html#SEC5">Target names</A>).

</P>
<P>
In other words, in both native and cross-development configurations,
host-independent files (text files, library source code, etc.) reside by
default in

</P>

<PRE>
/usr/cygnus/progressive-<VAR>release</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
while host-dependent files, like precompiled libraries and the tools
themselves, reside by default in

</P>

<PRE>
/usr/cygnus/progressive-<VAR>release</VAR>/H-<VAR>hosttype</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
For example, the Sun 4 cross <SAMP>`m68k-aout'</SAMP> cross-compiler for the
Progressive 94q4 release was configured with

</P>

<PRE>
configure --prefix=/usr/cygnus/progressive-94q4 \
 --exec-prefix=/usr/cygnus/progressive-94q4/H-sparc-sun-sunos4.1.3 \
 --target=m68k-aout
</PRE>


<H3>Installation</H3>

<P>
The installation procedure directs you to run the <CODE>Install</CODE> script
and then set some links in place so that the distribution may be easily
accessed and updated (see section `Installing your Developer's Kit' in <CITE>Installation Notes</CITE>) as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
ln -s /usr/cygnus/progressive-<VAR>release</VAR> /usr/cygnus/progressive
ln -s /usr/cygnus/progressive/H-<VAR>hosttype</VAR> /usr/progressive
</PRE>

<P>
This combination of a separate links provide the following benefits:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Access is granted to anyone who puts <TT>`/usr/progressive/bin'</TT> in
her or his path

<LI>

Updating is simplified; when you install a new Developer's Kit (with a
different value for <VAR>release</VAR>), you only need to change the link
<TT>`/usr/cygnus/progressive'</TT> to bring the new toolkit online

<LI>

Installed toolkits for multiple platforms can coexist in the same
location and share host-independent files, conserving disk space and
easing maintenance; if you install the toolkit for more than one
platform, <TT>`/usr/progressive'</TT> on each platform points to the
host-dependent files for that platform, yet the host-independent files
are shared (see section <A HREF="rebuilding_13.html#SEC12">The Heterogeneous Updateable Toolkit</A>)
</UL>

<P>
For more details on installing the default binary distribution from
Cygnus Support, see section `Installing your Developer's Kit' in <CITE>Installation Notes</CITE>.
