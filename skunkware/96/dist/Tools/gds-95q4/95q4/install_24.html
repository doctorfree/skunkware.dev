<H3><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="install_toc.html#TOC24">Error messages from <CODE>Install</CODE></A></H3>
<P>
The <CODE>Install</CODE> script checks for many errors and inconsistencies in
the way its arguments are used.  The messages are meant to be
self-explanatory.  Here is a list of a few messages where further
information might be useful:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>Can not read from TAPE device, <VAR>tape</VAR></CODE>
<DD>The error message ends with the tape device <CODE>Install</CODE> was trying to
use.  Please check that it is the device you intended; possible causes
of trouble might include leaving off the <SAMP>`/dev/'</SAMP> prefix at the
front of the device name.  A typographical error in the device name
might also cause this problem.

If the problem is neither of these, perhaps your tape device can't read
our tape; see section <A HREF="install_15.html#SEC15">Installing with a remote tape drive</A>, for a discussion of how to use another machine's
tape drive, or contact Cygnus Support.

<DT><CODE>stdin: not in compressed format</CODE>
<DD>You are probably not using the non--rewinding tape device.  There are
two files on each tape.  The first is a <CODE>tar</CODE> file containing the
<CODE>Install</CODE> script.  The second is a compressed <CODE>tar</CODE> file
containing everything else.  Without using the non--rewinding device,
there is no way to skip over the first file to begin reading the second.

<DT><CODE>gcc: cannot exec cpp</CODE>
<DD>If you've installed the binary distribution of the Developer's Kit
software in a non-standard location, remember to set your environment
variable <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE> accordingly.  See section <A HREF="install_16.html#SEC16">Running the programs</A>.

<DT><CODE>... This is a problem.</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>Cannot cd to <VAR>installdir</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>I do not know why I cannot create <VAR>installdir</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>hello.c fails to run</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>test-ioctl.c fails to run</CODE>
<DD>
These errors (the first covers anything that ends in <SAMP>`This is a
problem'</SAMP>) are from paranoia checks; they are issued for situations that
other checks should have covered, or for unlikely situations that
require further diagnosis.

If you get one of these messages, please call the Cygnus hotline, +1
415 903 1401, or send electronic mail to <SAMP>`help@cygnus.com'</SAMP>.
