<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="iostream_toc.html#TOC2">Licensing terms for <CODE>libio</CODE></A></H2>
<P>
Since the <CODE>iostream</CODE> classes are so fundamental to standard C++,
the Free Software Foundation has agreed to a special exception to its
standard license, when you link programs with <CODE>libio.a</CODE>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As a special exception, if you link this library with files
compiled with a GNU compiler to produce an executable, this does not cause
the resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General Public License.
This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why
the executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The code is under the GNU General Public License (version 2) for
all other purposes than linking with this library; that means that you
can modify and redistribute the code as usual, but remember that if you
do, your modifications, and anything you link with the modified code,
must be available to others on the same terms.
<P>
These functions are also available as part of the <CODE>libg++</CODE>
library; if you link with that library instead of <CODE>libio</CODE>, the
GNU Library General Public License applies.
