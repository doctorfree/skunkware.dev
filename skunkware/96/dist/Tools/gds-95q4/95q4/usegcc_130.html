<P>
If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some guidelines:
<P>
<A NAME="IDX548"></A>
<A NAME="IDX549"></A>
<UL>
<LI>
If the compiler gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that is a
compiler bug.  Reliable compilers never crash.

<A NAME="IDX551"></A>
<A NAME="IDX550"></A>
<LI>
If the compiler produces invalid assembly code, for any input whatever
(except an <CODE>asm</CODE> statement), that is a compiler bug, unless the
compiler reports errors (not just warnings) which would ordinarily
prevent the assembler from being run.

<A NAME="IDX553"></A>
<A NAME="IDX554"></A>
<A NAME="IDX552"></A>
<LI>
If the compiler produces valid assembly code that does not correctly
execute the input source code, that is a compiler bug.

However, you must double-check to make sure, because you may have run
into an incompatibility between GNU C and traditional C
(see section <A HREF="usegcc_119.html#SEC122">Incompatibilities of GNU CC</A>).  These incompatibilities might be considered
bugs, but they are inescapable consequences of valuable features.

Or you may have a program whose behavior is undefined, which happened
by chance to give the desired results with another C or C++ compiler.

For example, in many nonoptimizing compilers, you can write <SAMP>`x;'</SAMP>
at the end of a function instead of <SAMP>`return x;'</SAMP>, with the same
results.  But the value of the function is undefined if <CODE>return</CODE>
is omitted; it is not a bug when GNU CC produces different results.

Problems often result from expressions with two increment operators,
as in <CODE>f (*p++, *p++)</CODE>.  Your previous compiler might have
interpreted that expression the way you intended; GNU CC might
interpret it another way.  Neither compiler is wrong.  The bug is
in your code.

After you have localized the error to a single source line, it should
be easy to check for these things.  If your program is correct and
well defined, you have found a compiler bug.

<LI>
If the compiler produces an error message for valid input, that is a
compiler bug.

<A NAME="IDX555"></A>
<LI>
If the compiler does not produce an error message for invalid input,
that is a compiler bug.  However, you should note that your idea of
"invalid input" might be my idea of "an extension" or "support
for traditional practice".

<LI>
If you are an experienced user of C or C++ compilers, your suggestions
for improvement of GNU CC or GNU C++ are welcome in any case.
