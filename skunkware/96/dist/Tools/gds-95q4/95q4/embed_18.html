<P>
You can use the GDB remote serial protocol to communicate with a
Hitachi H8/300H board.  You must first link your programs with the
"stub" module <TT>`src/gdb/config/H8/stub.c'</TT>.  This module manages
the communication with GDB.  See section `The GDB remote serial protocol' in <CITE>Debugging with GDB</CITE>, for more details.  Note
that the Hitachi LCEVB running CMON has the stub already built-in.
<P>
Use the special <CODE>gdb</CODE> command <SAMP>`device <VAR>port</VAR>'</SAMP> if you need
to explicitly set the serial device.  The default <VAR>port</VAR> is the
first available port on your host.  This is only necessary on Unix
hosts, where it is typically something like <TT>`/dev/ttya'</TT>.
<P>
GDB has another special command to set the communications speed:
<SAMP>`speed <VAR>bps</VAR>'</SAMP>.
<P>
The following sample session illustrates the steps needed to start a
program under GDB control on an H8/300, using a DOS host.
The example uses a sample H8 program called <TT>`t.x'</TT>.  The
procedure is the same for other Hitachi chips in the series.
<P>
First hook up your development board.  In this example, we use a board
attached to serial port <CODE>COM2</CODE>.  Call GDB with the name of
your program as the argument.  GDB prompts you, as usual, with
the prompt <SAMP>`(gdb)'</SAMP>.  Use two special commands to begin your
debugging session: <SAMP>`target hms'</SAMP> to specify cross-debugging to the
Hitachi board, and the <CODE>load</CODE> command to download your program to
the board.  <CODE>load</CODE> displays the names of the program's sections,
and a <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> for each 2K of data downloaded.  (If you want to refresh
GDB data on symbols or on the executable file without downloading,
use the GDB commands <CODE>file</CODE> or <CODE>symbol-file</CODE>.  These
commands, and <CODE>load</CODE> itself, are described in section `Commands to specify files' in <CITE>Debugging with GDB</CITE>.)
<P>

</PRE>
<P>
At this point, you're ready to run or debug your program.  From here on,
you can use all the usual GDB commands.  The <CODE>break</CODE> command
sets breakpoints; the <CODE>run</CODE> command starts your program;
<CODE>print</CODE> or <CODE>x</CODE> display data; the <CODE>continue</CODE> command
resumes execution after stopping at a breakpoint.  You can use the
<CODE>help</CODE> command at any time to find out more about GDB commands.
<P>
Remember, however, that <EM>operating system</EM> facilities aren't
available on your development board; for example, if your program hangs,
you can't send an interrupt--but you can press the RESET switch!
<P>
Use the RESET button on the development board:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
to interrupt your program (don't use <KBD>Ctrl-C</KBD> on the DOS
host--it has no way to pass an interrupt signal to the development
board).

<LI>
to return to the GDB command prompt after your program finishes
normally.  The communications protocol provides no other way for
GDB to detect program completion.
</UL>
<P>
In either case, GDB sees the effect of a RESET on the
development board as a "normal exit" of your program.
