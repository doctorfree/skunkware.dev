<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="relnotes_toc.html#TOC8">What's new with GDB</A></H2>
<P>
GDB has had many bug fixes, particularly in the support of various
remote targets.
<P>
Please note that, although the GDB version number is `4.14-95q4', the
code is nearly identical to FSF GDB 4.15.  There will be some
differences, but they are minor, and this release has features, such
as AIX 4.1 support, that are not in 4.15.
<P>
For the complete matrix of supported hosts vs. targets, see 
section <A HREF="relnotes_1.html#SEC1">Cygnus Developer's Kit: Progressive--95q4</A>.  Contact us at +1-800 CYGNUS-1 if you have any questions.

<LI><CODE>$_exitcode</CODE>

There is a new convenience variable <CODE>$_exitcode</CODE> that is set to the
value of the termination code returned when an inferior process exits.

<LI><CODE>quit</CODE>

The <CODE>quit</CODE> command now accepts an optional argument that is the error
code that GDB will return when it exits.

<LI><CODE>load</CODE>

The <CODE>load</CODE> command in the I960-NINDY configuration now runs much 
faster.

<LI>Data cache for remote targets

Remote targets now use a data cache to speed up communication with the
remote side.  The data cache could lead to incorrect results because
it doesn't know about volatile variables, thus making it impossible to
debug targets which use memory mapped I/O devices. Use <CODE>set remotecache
off</CODE> to turn the data cache off.

<LI>Support for multiple threads

The standard remote protocol now includes support for multiple threads
in the target system, using new protocol commands <CODE>H</CODE> and <CODE>T</CODE>.  See
<TT>`gdb/remote.c'</TT> for details.

<LI><CODE>--enable-netrom</CODE>

If GDB is configured with <CODE>--enable-netrom</CODE>, then it will include
support for the NetROM ROM emulator from XLNT Designs.  The NetROM
acts as though it is a bank of ROM on the target board, but you can
write into it over the network.  GDB's support consists only of
support for fast loading into the emulated ROM; to debug, you must use
another protocol, such as standard remote protocol.  The usual
sequence is:

<PRE>
target nrom &#60;netrom-hostname&#62;
load &#60;prog&#62;
target remote &#60;netrom-hostname&#62;:1235
</PRE>
