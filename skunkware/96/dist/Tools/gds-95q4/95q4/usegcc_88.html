<P>
By declaring a function <CODE>inline</CODE>, you can direct GNU CC to
integrate that function's code into the code for its callers.  This
makes execution faster by eliminating the function-call overhead; in
addition, if any of the actual argument values are constant, their known
values may permit simplifications at compile time so that not all of the
inline function's code needs to be included.  The effect on code size is
less predictable; object code may be larger or smaller with function
inlining, depending on the particular case.  Inlining of functions is an
optimization and it really "works" only in optimizing compilation.  If
you don't use <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, no function is really inline.
<P>
To declare a function inline, use the <CODE>inline</CODE> keyword in its
declaration, like this:
<P>
<PRE>
inline int
inc (int *a)
{
  (*a)++;
}
</PRE>
<P>
(If you are writing a header file to be included in ANSI C programs, write
<CODE>__inline__</CODE> instead of <CODE>inline</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="usegcc_99.html#SEC102">Alternate Keywords</A>.)
<P>
You can also make all "simple enough" functions inline with the option
<SAMP>`-finline-functions'</SAMP>.  Note that certain usages in a function
definition can make it unsuitable for inline substitution.
<P>
Note that in C and Objective C, unlike C++, the <CODE>inline</CODE> keyword
does not affect the linkage of the function.
<A NAME="IDX379"></A>
<A NAME="IDX380"></A>
<A NAME="IDX381"></A>
<A NAME="IDX382"></A>
<P>
GNU CC automatically inlines member functions defined within the class
body of C++ programs even if they are not explicitly declared
<CODE>inline</CODE>.  (You can override this with <SAMP>`-fno-default-inline'</SAMP>;
see section <A HREF="usegcc_11.html#SEC14">Options Controlling C++ Dialect</A>.)
<A NAME="IDX383"></A>
<P>
When a function is both inline and <CODE>static</CODE>, if all calls to the
function are integrated into the caller, and the function's address is
never used, then the function's own assembler code is never referenced.
In this case, GNU CC does not actually output assembler code for the
function, unless you specify the option <SAMP>`-fkeep-inline-functions'</SAMP>.
Some calls cannot be integrated for various reasons (in particular,
calls that precede the function's definition cannot be integrated, and
neither can recursive calls within the definition).  If there is a
nonintegrated call, then the function is compiled to assembler code as
usual.  The function must also be compiled as usual if the program
refers to its address, because that can't be inlined.
<A NAME="IDX384"></A>
<P>
When an inline function is not <CODE>static</CODE>, then the compiler must assume
that there may be calls from other source files; since a global symbol can
be defined only once in any program, the function must not be defined in
the other source files, so the calls therein cannot be integrated.
Therefore, a non-<CODE>static</CODE> inline function is always compiled on its
own in the usual fashion.
<P>
If you specify both <CODE>inline</CODE> and <CODE>extern</CODE> in the function
definition, then the definition is used only for inlining.  In no case
is the function compiled on its own, not even if you refer to its
address explicitly.  Such an address becomes an external reference, as
if you had only declared the function, and had not defined it.
<P>
This combination of <CODE>inline</CODE> and <CODE>extern</CODE> has almost the
effect of a macro.  The way to use it is to put a function definition in
a header file with these keywords, and put another copy of the
definition (lacking <CODE>inline</CODE> and <CODE>extern</CODE>) in a library file.
The definition in the header file will cause most calls to the function
to be inlined.  If any uses of the function remain, they will refer to
the single copy in the library.
<P>
GNU C does not inline any functions when not optimizing.  It is not
clear whether it is better to inline or not, in this case, but we found
that a correct implementation when not optimizing was difficult.  So we
did the easy thing, and turned it off.
