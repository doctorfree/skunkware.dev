<P>
An individual member of an archive file can be used as a target or
dependency in <CODE>make</CODE>.  You specify the member named <VAR>member</VAR> in
archive file <VAR>archive</VAR> as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
<VAR>archive</VAR>(<VAR>member</VAR>)
</PRE>
<P>
This construct is available only in targets and dependencies, not in
commands!  Most programs that you might use in commands do not support this
syntax and cannot act directly on archive members.  Only <CODE>ar</CODE> and
other programs specifically designed to operate on archives can do so.
Therefore, valid commands to update an archive member target probably must
use <CODE>ar</CODE>.  For example, this rule says to create a member
<TT>`hack.o'</TT> in archive <TT>`foolib'</TT> by copying the file <TT>`hack.o'</TT>:
<P>
<PRE>
foolib(hack.o) : hack.o
        ar cr foolib hack.o
</PRE>
<P>
In fact, nearly all archive member targets are updated in just this way
and there is an implicit rule to do it for you.  <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> The
<SAMP>`c'</SAMP> flag to <CODE>ar</CODE> is required if the archive file does not
already exist.
<P>
To specify several members in the same archive, you can write all the
member names together between the parentheses.  For example:
<P>
<PRE>
foolib(hack.o kludge.o)
</PRE>
<P>
is equivalent to:
<P>
<PRE>
foolib(hack.o) foolib(kludge.o)
</PRE>
<A NAME="IDX827"></A>
<P>
You can also use shell-style wildcards in an archive member reference.
See section <A HREF="make_22.html#SEC21">Using Wildcard Characters in File Names</A>.  For
example, <SAMP>`foolib(*.o)'</SAMP> expands to all existing members of the
<TT>`foolib'</TT> archive whose names end in <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP>; perhaps
<SAMP>`foolib(hack.o) foolib(kludge.o)'</SAMP>.
