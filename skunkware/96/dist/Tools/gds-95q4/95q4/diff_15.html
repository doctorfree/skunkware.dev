<P>
Usually, when you are looking at the differences between files, you will
also want to see the parts of the files near the lines that differ, to
help you understand exactly what has changed.  These nearby parts of the
files are called the <DFN>context</DFN>.
<P>
GNU <CODE>diff</CODE> provides two output formats that show context around the
differing lines: <DFN>context format</DFN> and <DFN>unified format</DFN>.  It can
optionally show in which function or section of the file the differing
lines are found.
<P>
If you are distributing new versions of files to other people in the
form of <CODE>diff</CODE> output, you should use one of the output formats
that show context so that they can apply the diffs even if they have
made small changes of their own to the files.  <CODE>patch</CODE> can apply
the diffs in this case by searching in the files for the lines of
context around the differing lines; if those lines are actually a few
lines away from where the diff says they are, <CODE>patch</CODE> can adjust
the line numbers accordingly and still apply the diff correctly.
See section <A HREF="diff_62.html#SEC62">Applying Imperfect Patches</A>, for more information on using <CODE>patch</CODE> to apply
imperfect diffs.
