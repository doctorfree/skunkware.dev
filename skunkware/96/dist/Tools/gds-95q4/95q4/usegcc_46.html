<P>
GNU CC can function as a cross-compiler for many machines, but not all.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Cross-compilers for the Mips as target using the Mips assembler
currently do not work, because the auxiliary programs
<TT>`mips-tdump.c'</TT> and <TT>`mips-tfile.c'</TT> can't be compiled on
anything but a Mips.  It does work to cross compile for a Mips
if you use the GNU assembler and linker.

<LI>
Cross-compilers between machines with different floating point formats
have not all been made to work.  GNU CC now has a floating point
emulator with which these can work, but each target machine description
needs to be updated to take advantage of it.

<LI>
Cross-compilation between machines of different word sizes is
somewhat problematic and sometimes does not work.
</UL>
<P>
Since GNU CC generates assembler code, you probably need a
cross-assembler that GNU CC can run, in order to produce object files.
If you want to link on other than the target machine, you need a
cross-linker as well.  You also need header files and libraries suitable
for the target machine that you can install on the host machine.
