<H3><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="rebuilding_toc.html#SEC25">Multiple simultaneous builds</A></H3>

<P>
If the source code for your distribution resides on a disk shared by
other machines in the network, you can build for all host types
simultaneously by using different <STRONG>build directories</STRONG>.  See section <A HREF="rebuilding_8.html#SEC7">Source and Build Directories</A>, for details on building with
different source and build directories; also see
section <A HREF="rebuilding_24.html#SEC23">Example: different <VAR>srcdir</VAR> and <VAR>objdir</VAR></A>,
for an example.

</P>
<P>
Multiple simultaneous builds can be conducted on the same source code
simply by using different build directories.  For example, assume we
have source code in <TT>`/usr/local/src'</TT>, and wish to build a
native toolkit for our Sun SPARCstation running SunOS 4.1.3
(<CODE>sparky</CODE>) and our DECstation running Ultrix (<CODE>deckard</CODE>), and
that we also wish to build a cross-development toolkit for each host for
a <SAMP>`m68k-aout'</SAMP> target.

</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Note:</EM> this example shows a complete build for all four
configurations, one native development system and one cross-development
system for each of two hosts, including installation and links.
See section <A HREF="rebuilding_13.html#SEC12">The Heterogeneous Updateable Toolkit</A>, for more general
discussions and examples.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
All of these toolkits are to be installed into

</P>

<PRE>
/usr/local/progressive-94q4
</PRE>

<P>
(The cross-development tools are installed with the native tools;
however, the cross tools have a prefix of <VAR>target</VAR>, e.g.,
<TT>`m68k-aout-gcc'</TT>.)  They are to be linked so that
<TT>`/usr/progressive/bin'</TT> on each host points toward the correct
binaries for that host:

</P>

<PRE>
/usr/local/progressive-94q4/H-<VAR>hosttype</VAR>/bin
</PRE>

<P>
but the machine-independent files in

</P>

<PRE>
/usr/local/progressive-94q4
</PRE>

<P>
are shared across platforms.  We accomplish this by actually installing
into a shared disk called <TT>`shared'</TT>, and creating links from
<TT>`/usr/local'</TT>.

</P>

<PRE>

     <EM>first, set up the shared space in <TT>`/shared'</TT></EM>

$ mkdir /shared/local
$ su     <EM>(may need root priviledge to put link in <TT>`/usr'</TT>)</EM>
# ln -s /shared/local /usr/local
# mkdir /usr/local/progressive-94q4
# exit

     <EM>now we build the native toolset for the Sun</EM>

# ln -s /usr/local/progressive-94q4 /usr/local/progressive

# ln -s /usr/local/progressive/H-decstn /usr/progressive

<EM><TT>`/usr/progressive'</TT> on <CODE>deckard</CODE> now points to the DEC-specific installation</EM>

<P>
(This example shows a Bourne-compatible shell (<CODE>sh</CODE>, <CODE>bash</CODE>,
<CODE>ksh</CODE>); contact Cygnus if you have any trouble.)

</P>
<P>
<TT>`/usr/progressive/bin'</TT> on each host now points toward the binaries
built for that <VAR>hosttype</VAR>, while the machine-independent files in
<TT>`/usr/local/progressive'</TT> are shared between the two builds.  In
addition, each installation contains both a native development toolkit
and a cross-development toolkit for the <SAMP>`m68k-aout'</SAMP> target.

Please contact Cygnus Support if any of this is unclear, or if you have
any questions.
