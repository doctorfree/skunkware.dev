<P>
Certain standard ways of remaking target files are used very often.  For
example, one customary way to make an object file is from a C source file
using the C compiler, <CODE>cc</CODE>.
<P>
<DFN>Implicit rules</DFN> tell <CODE>make</CODE> how to use customary techniques so
that you do not have to specify them in detail when you want to use
them.  For example, there is an implicit rule for C compilation.  File
names determine which implicit rules are run.  For example, C
compilation typically takes a <TT>`.c'</TT> file and makes a <TT>`.o'</TT> file.
So <CODE>make</CODE> applies the implicit rule for C compilation when it sees
this combination of file name endings.<P>
A chain of implicit rules can apply in sequence; for example, <CODE>make</CODE>
will remake a <TT>`.o'</TT> file from a <TT>`.y'</TT> file by way of a <TT>`.c'</TT> file.
See section <A HREF="make_91.html#SEC90">Chains of Implicit Rules</A>.
<P>
The built-in implicit rules use several variables in their commands so
that, by changing the values of the variables, you can change the way the
implicit rule works.  For example, the variable <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> controls the
flags given to the C compiler by the implicit rule for C compilation.
See section <A HREF="make_90.html#SEC89">Variables Used by Implicit Rules</A>.
<P>
You can define your own implicit rules by writing <DFN>pattern rules</DFN>.
See section <A HREF="make_92.html#SEC91">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</A>.
<P>
<DFN>Suffix rules</DFN> are a more limited way to define implicit rules.
Pattern rules are more general and clearer, but suffix rules are
retained for compatibility.
See section <A HREF="make_100.html#SEC99">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</A>.
