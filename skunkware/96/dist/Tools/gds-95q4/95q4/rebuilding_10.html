<H1><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="rebuilding_toc.html#SEC9">Compilation</A></H1>

<P>
After you've run <CODE>configure</CODE>, compilation is straightforward.  To
compile all the programs in the Developer's Kit, run:

</P>

<PRE>
make all info &#62; make.log
</PRE>

<P>
The examples suggest capturing the <CODE>make</CODE> output in a
<TT>`make.log'</TT> file, because the output is lengthy.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>make</CODE> creates a set of binaries which run on your <VAR>hosttype</VAR>
and which compile code for the specified <VAR>target</VAR> (or for the
<VAR>hosttype</VAR> in a native configuration).  Programs which require
compiled-in pathnames are built with the values you specified on the
command line to <CODE>configure</CODE> with the options <SAMP>`--prefix'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`--exec-prefix'</SAMP>.  In cross-development configurations, programs are
named with <VAR>target</VAR> as a prefix; for example, the cross-compiler is
named <CODE><VAR>target</VAR>-gcc</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The overall <TT>`Makefile'</TT> propagates the value of the <CODE>CC</CODE>
variable explicitly, so that you can easily control the compiler used in
this step.  <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> is treated the same way.  For instance, to
build the compiler a second time, using <CODE>gcc</CODE> to compile itself
(after building and installing it in the alternate directory
<TT>`/usr/local'</TT>; see section <A HREF="rebuilding_9.html#SEC8">Rebuilding using <CODE>gcc</CODE></A>), you might follow this example:

</P>

<PRE>
$ CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc configure ...
$ make CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc CFLAGS=-O2 all info &#62; make.log
</PRE>

<P>
Make sure you specify the same compiler for <CODE>CC</CODE> for both the
<CODE>configure</CODE> and <CODE>make</CODE> steps.

</P>
<P>
The conventional targets <CODE>all</CODE>, <CODE>install</CODE>, and <CODE>clean</CODE>
are supported at all levels of <TT>`Makefile'</TT>.  (Other targets are
supported as well, as appropriate in each directory.)  Each
<TT>`Makefile'</TT> in the source directories includes ample comments to
help you read it.  If you are not familiar with <CODE>make</CODE>, refer to
section `Overview of <CODE>make</CODE>' in <CITE>GNU Make: A Program for Directing Recompilation</CITE>.
