<P>
Line group formats let you specify formats suitable for many
applications that allow if-then-else input, including programming
languages and text formatting languages.  A line group format specifies
the output format for a contiguous group of similar lines.
<P>
For example, the following command compares the TeX files <TT>`old'</TT>
and <TT>`new'</TT>, and outputs a merged file in which old regions are
surrounded by <SAMP>`\begin{em}'</SAMP>-<SAMP>`\end{em}'</SAMP> lines, and new
regions are surrounded by <SAMP>`\begin{bf}'</SAMP>-<SAMP>`\end{bf}'</SAMP> lines.
<P>
<PRE>
diff \
   --old-group-format='\begin{em}
%&#60;\end{em}
' \
   --new-group-format='\begin{bf}
%&#62;\end{bf}
' \
   old new
</PRE>
<P>
The following command is equivalent to the above example, but it is a
little more verbose, because it spells out the default line group formats.
<P>
<PRE>
diff \
   --old-group-format='\begin{em}
%&#60;\end{em}
' \
   --new-group-format='\begin{bf}
%&#62;\end{bf}
' \
   --unchanged-group-format='%=' \
   --changed-group-format='\begin{em}
%&#60;\end{em}
\begin{bf}
%&#62;\end{bf}
' \
   old new
</PRE>
<P>
Here is a more advanced example, which outputs a diff listing with
headers containing line numbers in a "plain English" style.
<P>
<PRE>
diff \
 --unchanged-group-format=" \
 --old-group-format='-------- %dn line%(n=1?:s) deleted at %df:
%&#60;' \
 --new-group-format='-------- %dN line%(N=1?:s) added after %de:
%&#62;' \
 --changed-group-format='-------- %dn line%(n=1?:s) changed at %df:
%&#60;-------- to:
%&#62;' \
 old new
</PRE>
<P>
To specify a line group format, use <CODE>diff</CODE> with one of the options
listed below.  You can specify up to four line group formats, one for
each kind of line group.  You should quote <VAR>format</VAR>, because it
typically contains shell metacharacters.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`--old-group-format=<VAR>format</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>These line groups are hunks containing only lines from the first file.
The default old group format is the same as the changed group format if
it is specified; otherwise it is a format that outputs the line group as-is.

<DT><SAMP>`--new-group-format=<VAR>format</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>These line groups are hunks containing only lines from the second
file.  The default new group format is same as the the changed group
format if it is specified; otherwise it is a format that outputs the
line group as-is.

<DT><SAMP>`--changed-group-format=<VAR>format</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>These line groups are hunks containing lines from both files.  The
default changed group format is the concatenation of the old and new
group formats.

<DT><SAMP>`--unchanged-group-format=<VAR>format</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>These line groups contain lines common to both files.  The default
unchanged group format is a format that outputs the line group as-is.
</DL>
<P>
In a line group format, ordinary characters represent themselves;
conversion specifications start with <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> and have one of the
following forms.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`%&#60;'</SAMP>
<DD>stands for the lines from the first file, including the trailing newline.
Each line is formatted according to the old line format (see section <A HREF="diff_38.html#SEC38">Line Formats</A>).

<DT><SAMP>`%&#62;'</SAMP>
<DD>stands for the lines from the second file, including the trailing newline.
Each line is formatted according to the new line format.

<DT><SAMP>`%='</SAMP>
<DD>stands for the lines common to both files, including the trailing newline.
Each line is formatted according to the unchanged line format.

<DT><SAMP>`%%'</SAMP>
<DD>stands for <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>.

<DT><SAMP>`%c'<VAR>C</VAR>''</SAMP>
<DD>where <VAR>C</VAR> is a single character, stands for <VAR>C</VAR>.
<VAR>C</VAR> may not be a backslash or an apostrophe.
For example, <SAMP>`%c':''</SAMP> stands for a colon, even inside
the then-part of an if-then-else format, which a colon would
normally terminate.

<DT><SAMP>`%c'\<VAR>O</VAR>''</SAMP>
<DD>where <VAR>O</VAR> is a string of 1, 2, or 3 octal digits,
stands for the character with octal code <VAR>O</VAR>.
For example, <SAMP>`%c'\0''</SAMP> stands for a null character.

<DT><SAMP>`<VAR>F</VAR><VAR>n</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>where <VAR>F</VAR> is a <CODE>printf</CODE> conversion specification and <VAR>n</VAR> is one
of the following letters, stands for <VAR>n</VAR>'s value formatted with <VAR>F</VAR>.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`e'</SAMP>
<DD>The line number of the line just before the group in the old file.

<DT><SAMP>`f'</SAMP>
<DD>The line number of the first line in the group in the old file;
equals <VAR>e</VAR> + 1.

<DT><SAMP>`l'</SAMP>
<DD>The line number of the last line in the group in the old file.

<DT><SAMP>`m'</SAMP>
<DD>The line number of the line just after the group in the old file;
equals <VAR>l</VAR> + 1.

<DT><SAMP>`n'</SAMP>
<DD>The number of lines in the group in the old file; equals <VAR>l</VAR> - <VAR>f</VAR> + 1.

<DT><SAMP>`E, F, L, M, N'</SAMP>
<DD>Likewise, for lines in the new file.

</DL>

The <CODE>printf</CODE> conversion specification can be <SAMP>`%d'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`%o'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`%x'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`%X'</SAMP>, specifying decimal, octal,
lower case hexadecimal, or upper case hexadecimal output
respectively.  After the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> the following options can appear in
sequence: a <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> specifying left-justification; an integer
specifying the minimum field width; and a period followed by an
optional integer specifying the minimum number of digits.
For example, <SAMP>`%5dN'</SAMP> prints the number of new lines in the group
in a field of width 5 characters, using the <CODE>printf</CODE> format <CODE>"%5d"</CODE>.

<DT><SAMP>`(<VAR>A</VAR>=<VAR>B</VAR>?<VAR>T</VAR>:<VAR>E</VAR>)'</SAMP>
<DD>If <VAR>A</VAR> equals <VAR>B</VAR> then <VAR>T</VAR> else <VAR>E</VAR>.
<VAR>A</VAR> and <VAR>B</VAR> are each either a decimal constant
or a single letter interpreted as above.
This format spec is equivalent to <VAR>T</VAR> if
<VAR>A</VAR>'s value equals <VAR>B</VAR>'s; otherwise it is equivalent to <VAR>E</VAR>.

For example, <SAMP>`%(N=0?no:%dN) line%(N=1?:s)'</SAMP> is equivalent to
<SAMP>`no lines'</SAMP> if <VAR>N</VAR> (the number of lines in the group in the the
new file) is 0, to <SAMP>`1 line'</SAMP> if <VAR>N</VAR> is 1, and to <SAMP>`%dN lines'</SAMP>
otherwise.
