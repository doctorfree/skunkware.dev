<P>
<CODE>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE> means the same thing for native and cross.  It is
where GNU CC stores its private include files, and also where GNU CC
stores the fixed include files.  A cross compiled GNU CC runs
<CODE>fixincludes</CODE> on the header files in <TT>`$(tooldir)/include'</TT>.
(If the cross compilation header files need to be fixed, they must be
installed before GNU CC is built.  If the cross compilation header files
are already suitable for ANSI C and GNU CC, nothing special need be
done).
<P>
<CODE>GPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE> means the same thing for native and cross.  It
is where <CODE>g++</CODE> looks first for header files.  <CODE>libg++</CODE>
installs only target independent header files in that directory.
<P>
<CODE>LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE> is used only for a native compiler.  It is
normally <TT>`/usr/local/include'</TT>.  GNU CC searches this directory so
that users can install header files in <TT>`/usr/local/include'</TT>.
<P>
<CODE>CROSS_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE> is used only for a cross compiler.  GNU CC
doesn't install anything there.
<P>
<CODE>TOOL_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE> is used for both native and cross compilers.  It
is the place for other packages to install header files that GNU CC will
use.  For a cross-compiler, this is the equivalent of
<TT>`/usr/include'</TT>.  When you build a cross-compiler,
<CODE>fixincludes</CODE> processes any header files in this directory.
