<P>
When it is time to execute commands to update a target, they are executed
by making a new subshell for each line.  (In practice, <CODE>make</CODE> may
take shortcuts that do not affect the results.)
<A NAME="IDX250"></A>
<P>
<STRONG>Please note:</STRONG> this implies that shell commands such as
<CODE>cd</CODE> that set variables local to each process will not affect the
following command lines.  If you want to use <CODE>cd</CODE> to affect the
next command, put the two on a single line with a semicolon between
them.  Then <CODE>make</CODE> will consider them a single command and pass
them, together, to a shell which will execute them in sequence.  For
example:
<P>
<PRE>
foo : bar/lose
        cd bar; gobble lose &#62; ../foo
</PRE>
<A NAME="IDX251"></A>
<A NAME="IDX252"></A>
<A NAME="IDX253"></A>
<A NAME="IDX254"></A>
<A NAME="IDX255"></A>
<A NAME="IDX256"></A>
<P>
If you would like to split a single shell command into multiple lines of
text, you must use a backslash at the end of all but the last subline.
Such a sequence of lines is combined into a single line, by deleting the
backslash-newline sequences, before passing it to the shell.  Thus, the
following is equivalent to the preceding example:
<P>
<PRE>
foo : bar/lose
        cd bar;  \
        gobble lose &#62; ../foo
</PRE>
<A NAME="IDX257"></A>
<P>
The program used as the shell is taken from the variable <CODE>SHELL</CODE>.
By default, the program <TT>`/bin/sh'</TT> is used.
<A NAME="IDX258"></A>
<P>
Unlike most variables, the variable <CODE>SHELL</CODE> is never set from the
environment.  This is because the <CODE>SHELL</CODE> environment variable is
used to specify your personal choice of shell program for interactive
use.  It would be very bad for personal choices like this to affect
the functioning of makefiles.  See section <A HREF="make_67.html#SEC66">Variables from the Environment</A>.
