<H3><A NAME="SEC86" HREF="diff_toc.html#TOC86">Handling Changes to the Directory Structure</A></H3>
<P>
<CODE>diff</CODE> and <CODE>patch</CODE> do not handle some changes to directory
structure.  For example, suppose one directory tree contains a directory
named <SAMP>`D'</SAMP> with some subsidiary files, and another contains a file
with the same name <SAMP>`D'</SAMP>.  <SAMP>`diff -r'</SAMP> does not output enough
information for <CODE>patch</CODE> to transform the the directory subtree into
the file.
<P>
There should be a way to specify that a file has been deleted without
having to include its entire contents in the patch file.  There should
also be a way to tell <CODE>patch</CODE> that a file was renamed, even if
there is no way for <CODE>diff</CODE> to generate such information.
<P>
These problems can be fixed by extending the <CODE>diff</CODE> output format
to represent changes in directory structure, and extending <CODE>patch</CODE>
to understand these extensions.
