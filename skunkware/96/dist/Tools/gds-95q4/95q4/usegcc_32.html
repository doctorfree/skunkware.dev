<P>
These <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> options are defined for the HPPA family of computers:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-mpa-risc-1-0</CODE>
<DD>Generate code for a PA 1.0 processor.

<DT><CODE>-mpa-risc-1-1</CODE>
<DD>Generate code for a PA 1.1 processor.

<DT><CODE>-mjump-in-delay</CODE>
<DD>Fill delay slots of function calls with unconditional jump instructions
by modifying the return pointer for the function call to be the target
of the conditional jump.

<DT><CODE>-mdisable-fpregs</CODE>
<DD>Prevent floating point registers from being used in any manner.  This is
necessary for compiling kernels which perform lazy context switching of
floating point registers.  If you use this option and attempt to perform
floating point operations, the compiler will abort.

<DT><CODE>-mdisable-indexing</CODE>
<DD>Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes.  This avoids some
rather obscure problems when compiling MIG generated code under MACH.

<DT><CODE>-mno-space-regs</CODE>
<DD>Generate code that assumes the target has no space registers.  This allows
GCC to generate faster indirect calls and use unscaled index address modes.

Such code is suitable for level 0 PA systems and kernels.

<DT><CODE>-mportable-runtime</CODE>
<DD>Use the portable calling conventions proposed by HP for ELF systems.

<DT><CODE>-mgas</CODE>
<DD>Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS understands.

<DT><CODE>-mschedule=<VAR>cpu type</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Schedule code according to the constraints for the machine type
<VAR>cpu type</VAR>.  The choices for <VAR>cpu type</VAR> are <SAMP>`700'</SAMP> for
7<VAR>n</VAR>0 machines, <SAMP>`7100'</SAMP> for 7<VAR>n</VAR>5 machines, and <SAMP>`7100'</SAMP>
for 7<VAR>n</VAR>2 machines.  <SAMP>`700'</SAMP> is the default for <VAR>cpu type</VAR>.

Note the <SAMP>`7100LC'</SAMP> scheduling information is incomplete and using
<SAMP>`7100LC'</SAMP> often leads to bad schedules.  For now it's probably best
to use <SAMP>`7100'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`7100LC'</SAMP> for the 7<VAR>n</VAR>2 machines.

<DT><CODE>-msoft-float</CODE>
<DD>Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> the requisite libraries are not available for all HPPA
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.  The embedded target <SAMP>`hppa1.1-*-pro'</SAMP> 
does provide software floating point support.

<SAMP>`-msoft-float'</SAMP> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile <EM>all</EM> of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT>, the
library that comes with GNU CC, with <SAMP>`-msoft-float'</SAMP> in order for
this to work.
