Go to the <A HREF="as_1.html">first</A>, <A HREF="as_103.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="as_105.html">next</A>, <A HREF="as_222.html">last</A> section, <A HREF="as_toc.html">table of contents</A>.

<H2><A NAME="SEC106" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC106"><CODE>.org <VAR>new-lc</VAR> , <VAR>fill</VAR></CODE></A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX334"></A>
<A NAME="IDX335"></A>
<A NAME="IDX336"></A>
<A NAME="IDX337"></A>
<P>
Advance the location counter of the current section to
<VAR>new-lc</VAR>.  <VAR>new-lc</VAR> is either an absolute expression or an
expression with the same section as the current subsection.  That is,
you can't use <CODE>.org</CODE> to cross sections: if <VAR>new-lc</VAR> has the
wrong section, the <CODE>.org</CODE> directive is ignored.  To be compatible
with former assemblers, if the section of <VAR>new-lc</VAR> is absolute,
<CODE>as</CODE> issues a warning, then pretends the section of <VAR>new-lc</VAR>
is the same as the current subsection.
<P>
<CODE>.org</CODE> may only increase the location counter, or leave it
unchanged; you cannot use <CODE>.org</CODE> to move the location counter
backwards.
<P>
Because <CODE>as</CODE> tries to assemble programs in one pass, <VAR>new-lc</VAR>
may not be undefined.  If you really detest this restriction we eagerly await
a chance to share your improved assembler.
<P>
Beware that the origin is relative to the start of the section, not
to the start of the subsection.  This is compatible with other
people's assemblers.
<P>
When the location counter (of the current subsection) is advanced, the
intervening bytes are filled with <VAR>fill</VAR> which should be an
absolute expression.  If the comma and <VAR>fill</VAR> are omitted,
<VAR>fill</VAR> defaults to zero.
