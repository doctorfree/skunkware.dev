<H2><A NAME="SEC166" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC166">Syntax</A></H2>
The assembler syntax closely follows the HPPA instruction set
reference manual; assembler directives and general syntax closely follow the
HPPA assembly language reference manual, with a few noteworthy differences.
<P>
First, a colon may immediately follow a label definition.  This is
simply for compatibility with how most assembly language programmers
write code.
<P>
Some obscure expression parsing problems may affect hand written code which
uses the <CODE>spop</CODE> instructions, or code which makes significant
use of the <CODE>!</CODE> line separator.
<P>
<CODE>as</CODE> is much less forgiving about missing arguments and other
similar oversights than the HP assembler.  <CODE>as</CODE> notifies you
of missing arguments as syntax errors; this is regarded as a feature, not a
bug.
<P>
Finally, <CODE>as</CODE> allows you to use an external symbol without
explicitly importing the symbol.  <EM>Warning:</EM> in the future this will be
an error for HPPA targets.
<P>
Special characters for HPPA targets include:
<P>
<SAMP>`;'</SAMP> is the line comment character.
<P>
<SAMP>`!'</SAMP> can be used instead of a newline to separate statements.
<P>
Since <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.
