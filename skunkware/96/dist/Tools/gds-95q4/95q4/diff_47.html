<P>
Here is a third sample file that will be used in examples to illustrate
the output of <CODE>diff3</CODE> and how various options can change it.  The
first two files are the same that we used for <CODE>diff</CODE> (see section <A HREF="diff_11.html#SEC11">Two Sample Input Files</A>).  This is the third sample file, called <TT>`tao'</TT>:

<PRE>
The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way;
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
The named is the mother of all things.

Therefore let there always be non-being,
  so we may see their subtlety,
And let there always be being,
  so we may see their result.
The two are the same,
But after they are produced,
  they have different names.

  -- The Way of Lao-Tzu, tr. Wing-tsit Chan
