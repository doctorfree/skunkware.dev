<P>
Now here is an example of a naive way of using wildcard expansion, that
does not do what you would intend.  Suppose you would like to say that the
executable file <TT>`foo'</TT> is made from all the object files in the
directory, and you write this:
<P>
<PRE>
objects = *.o

foo : $(objects)
        cc -o foo $(CFLAGS) $(objects)
</PRE>
<P>
The value of <CODE>objects</CODE> is the actual string <SAMP>`*.o'</SAMP>.  Wildcard
expansion happens in the rule for <TT>`foo'</TT>, so that each <EM>existing</EM>
<SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> file becomes a dependency of <TT>`foo'</TT> and will be recompiled if
necessary.
<P>
But what if you delete all the <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> files?  When a wildcard matches
no files, it is left as it is, so then <TT>`foo'</TT> will depend on the
oddly-named file <TT>`*.o'</TT>.  Since no such file is likely to exist,
<CODE>make</CODE> will give you an error saying it cannot figure out how to
make <TT>`*.o'</TT>.  This is not what you want!
<P>
Actually it is possible to obtain the desired result with wildcard
expansion, but you need more sophisticated techniques, including the
<CODE>wildcard</CODE> function and string substitution.
These are described in the following section.
