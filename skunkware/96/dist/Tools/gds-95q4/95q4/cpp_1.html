<P>
The C preprocessor is a <DFN>macro processor</DFN> that is used automatically by
the C compiler to transform your program before actual compilation.  It is
called a macro processor because it allows you to define <DFN>macros</DFN>,
which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.
<P>
The C preprocessor provides four separate facilities that you can use as
you see fit:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Inclusion of header files.  These are files of declarations that can be
substituted into your program.

<LI>
Macro expansion.  You can define <DFN>macros</DFN>, which are abbreviations
for arbitrary fragments of C code, and then the C preprocessor will
replace the macros with their definitions throughout the program.

<LI>
Conditional compilation.  Using special preprocessing directives, you
can include or exclude parts of the program according to various
conditions.

<LI>
Line control.  If you use a program to combine or rearrange source files into
an intermediate file which is then compiled, you can use line control
to inform the compiler of where each source line originally came from.
</UL>
<P>
C preprocessors vary in some details.  This manual discusses the GNU C
preprocessor, the C Compatible Compiler Preprocessor.  The GNU C
preprocessor provides a superset of the features of ANSI Standard C.
<P>
ANSI Standard C requires the rejection of many harmless constructs commonly
used by today's C programs.  Such incompatibility would be inconvenient for
users, so the GNU C preprocessor is configured to accept these constructs
by default.  Strictly speaking, to get ANSI Standard C, you must use the
options <SAMP>`-trigraphs'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-undef'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP>, but in
practice the consequences of having strict ANSI Standard C make it
undesirable to do this.  See section <A HREF="cpp_41.html#SEC42">Invoking the C Preprocessor</A>.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="cpp_toc.html#TOC2">Transformations Made Globally</A></H2>
<P>
Most C preprocessor features are inactive unless you give specific directives
to request their use.  (Preprocessing directives are lines starting with
<SAMP>`#'</SAMP>; see section <A HREF="cpp_2.html#SEC3">Preprocessing Directives</A>).  But there are three transformations that the
preprocessor always makes on all the input it receives, even in the absence
of directives.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
All C comments are replaced with single spaces.

<LI>
Backslash-Newline sequences are deleted, no matter where.  This
feature allows you to break long lines for cosmetic purposes without
changing their meaning.

<LI>
Predefined macro names are replaced with their expansions
(see section <A HREF="cpp_12.html#SEC13">Predefined Macros</A>).
</UL>
<P>
The first two transformations are done <EM>before</EM> nearly all other parsing
and before preprocessing directives are recognized.  Thus, for example, you
can split a line cosmetically with Backslash-Newline anywhere (except
when trigraphs are in use; see below).
<P>
<PRE>
/*
*/ # /*
*/ defi\
ne FO\
O 10\
20
</PRE>
<P>
is equivalent into <SAMP>`#define FOO 1020'</SAMP>.  You can split even an escape
sequence with Backslash-Newline.  For example, you can split <CODE>"foo\bar"</CODE>
between the <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> and the <SAMP>`b'</SAMP> to get
<P>
<PRE>
"foo\\
bar"
</PRE>
<P>
This behavior is unclean: in all other contexts, a Backslash can be
inserted in a string constant as an ordinary character by writing a double
Backslash, and this creates an exception.  But the ANSI C standard requires
it.  (Strict ANSI C does not allow Newlines in string constants, so they
do not consider this a problem.)
<P>
But there are a few exceptions to all three transformations.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
C comments and predefined macro names are not recognized inside a
<SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> directive in which the file name is delimited with
<SAMP>`&#60;'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP>.

<LI>
C comments and predefined macro names are never recognized within a
character or string constant.  (Strictly speaking, this is the rule,
not an exception, but it is worth noting here anyway.)

<LI>
Backslash-Newline may not safely be used within an ANSI "trigraph".
Trigraphs are converted before Backslash-Newline is deleted.  If you
write what looks like a trigraph with a Backslash-Newline inside, the
Backslash-Newline is deleted as usual, but it is then too late to
recognize the trigraph.

This exception is relevant only if you use the <SAMP>`-trigraphs'</SAMP>
option to enable trigraph processing.  See section <A HREF="cpp_41.html#SEC42">Invoking the C Preprocessor</A>.
