<H3><A NAME="SEC27" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC27">The <CODE>vpath</CODE> Directive</A></H3>
<P>
Similar to the <CODE>VPATH</CODE> variable but more selective is the <CODE>vpath</CODE>
directive (note lower case), which allows you to specify a search path for a particular class
of file names, those that match a particular pattern.  Thus you can supply
certain search directories for one class of file names and other directories
(or none) for other file names.
<P>
There are three forms of the <CODE>vpath</CODE> directive:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>vpath <VAR>pattern</VAR> <VAR>directories</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Specify the search path <VAR>directories</VAR> for file names that match
<VAR>pattern</VAR>.  

The search path, <VAR>directories</VAR>, is a list of directories to be
searched, separated by colons or blanks, just like the search path used
in the <CODE>VPATH</CODE> variable.

<DT><CODE>vpath <VAR>pattern</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Clear out the search path associated with <VAR>pattern</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>vpath</CODE>
<DD>
Clear all search paths previously specified with <CODE>vpath</CODE> directives.
</DL>
<P>
A <CODE>vpath</CODE> pattern is a string containing a <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> character.  The
string must match the file name of a dependency that is being searched
for, the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> character matching any sequence of zero or more
characters (as in pattern rules; see section <A HREF="make_92.html#SEC91">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</A>).  For example, <CODE>%.h</CODE> matches files that
end in <CODE>.h</CODE>.  (If there is no <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>, the pattern must match the
dependency exactly, which is not useful very often.)
<A NAME="IDX139"></A>
<A NAME="IDX140"></A>
<A NAME="IDX141"></A>
<A NAME="IDX142"></A>
<A NAME="IDX143"></A>
<P>
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> characters in a <CODE>vpath</CODE> directive's pattern can be quoted
with preceding backslashes (<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>).  Backslashes that would otherwise
quote <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> characters can be quoted with more backslashes.
Backslashes that quote <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> characters or other backslashes are
removed from the pattern before it is compared to file names.  Backslashes
that are not in danger of quoting <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> characters go unmolested.<P>
When a dependency fails to exist in the current directory, if the
<VAR>pattern</VAR> in a <CODE>vpath</CODE> directive matches the name of the
dependency file, then the <VAR>directories</VAR> in that directive are searched
just like (and before) the directories in the <CODE>VPATH</CODE> variable.  
<P>
For example,
<P>
<PRE>
vpath %.h ../headers
</PRE>
<P>
tells <CODE>make</CODE> to look for any dependency whose name ends in <TT>`.h'</TT>
in the directory <TT>`../headers'</TT> if the file is not found in the current
directory.
<P>
If several <CODE>vpath</CODE> patterns match the dependency file's name, then
<CODE>make</CODE> processes each matching <CODE>vpath</CODE> directive one by one,
searching all the directories mentioned in each directive.  <CODE>make</CODE>
handles multiple <CODE>vpath</CODE> directives in the order in which they
appear in the makefile; multiple directives with the same pattern are
independent of each other.
<P>
Thus, 
<P>
<PRE>
vpath %.c foo
vpath %   blish
vpath %.c bar
</PRE>
<P>
will look for a file ending in <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> in <TT>`foo'</TT>, then
<TT>`blish'</TT>, then <TT>`bar'</TT>, while
<P>
<PRE>
vpath %.c foo:bar
vpath %   blish
</PRE>
<P>
will look for a file ending in <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> in <TT>`foo'</TT>, then
<TT>`bar'</TT>, then <TT>`blish'</TT>.
