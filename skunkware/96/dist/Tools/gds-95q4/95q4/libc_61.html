<STRONG>Synopsis</STRONG>
<PRE>
#include &#60;stdio.h&#62;
long ftell(FILE *<VAR>fp</VAR>);

</PRE>
<STRONG>Description</STRONG><BR>
Objects of type <CODE>FILE</CODE> can have a "position" that records how much
of the file your program has already read.  Many of the <CODE>stdio</CODE> functions
depend on this position, and many change it as a side effect.
<P>
The result of <CODE>ftell</CODE> is the current position for a file
identified by <VAR>fp</VAR>.  If you record this result, you can later
use it with <CODE>fseek</CODE> to return the file to this
position.
<P>
In the current implementation, <CODE>ftell</CODE> simply uses a character
count to represent the file position; this is the same number that
would be recorded by <CODE>fgetpos</CODE>.
<P>
<BR>
<STRONG>Returns</STRONG><BR>
<CODE>ftell</CODE> returns the file position, if possible.  If it cannot do
this, it returns <CODE>-1L</CODE>.  Failure occurs on streams that do not support
positioning; the global <CODE>errno</CODE> indicates this condition with the
value <CODE>ESPIPE</CODE>.
<P>
<BR>
<STRONG>Portability</STRONG><BR>
<CODE>ftell</CODE> is required by the ANSI C standard, but the meaning of its
result (when successful) is not specified beyond requiring that it be
acceptable as an argument to <CODE>fseek</CODE>.  In particular, other
conforming C implementations may return a different result from
<CODE>ftell</CODE> than what <CODE>fgetpos</CODE> records.
<P>
No supporting OS subroutines are required.
