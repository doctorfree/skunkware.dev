Cygnus Support in Mountain View, CA, uses PRMS and <CODE>send-pr</CODE>
extensively for their support activities.  As a support company, Cygnus
finds problem tracking to be a crucial part of everyday business.
Cygnus supports the GNU compiling tools (including PRMS and
<CODE>send-pr</CODE>) over several many platforms
<P>
With each shipment of the Cygnus Support Developer's Kit, customers
receive the latest version of <CODE>send-pr</CODE>, which contains an
up-to-date listing of valid categories (values for the <CODE>&#62;Category:</CODE>
field).  Using these tools, Cygnus' customers can communicate their
problems to Cygnus effectively and receive automatic confirmation of
receipt as well as notification of changes in the status of their
reported problems.  Much of Cygnus' support mechanism relies on
electronic mail.
<P>
As an example, let's pretend we're a customer of Cygnus Support, and
that we're having a problem compiling some of our software using the
GNU C compiler, which Cygnus supports.
<P>
Assume that we're getting an error in our <CODE>bifrabulator</CODE> program
wherein the <SAMP>`prestidigitation'</SAMP> routines don't match with the
<SAMP>`whatsitsname'</SAMP>.  We've made sure we're following the rules of the
program and checked the Release Notes from Cygnus and found that the bug
isn't already known.  In other words, we're pretty sure we've found a
bug.
<A NAME="IDX147"></A>
<P>
Our first step is to call <CODE>send-pr</CODE>.  It really doesn't matter
whether we use <CODE>send-pr</CODE> from the shell or from within Emacs.
Indeed, if we use Emacs as a primary editor, calling <CODE>send-pr</CODE> from
the shell is likely to start <CODE>send-pr</CODE> in an Emacs buffer anyway.
So, since our company, <EM>Imaginary Software, Ltd.</EM>, uses GNU
software extensively, we're pretty familiar with Emacs, so from within
Emacs we type
<PRE>
M-x send-pr
</PRE>
and we're greeted with the following screen:

We know from past experience that we need to set certain information into
each field, so we compile all the information we know about our problem.
We have some sample code which we know should work, even though it
doesn't, so we'll include that.  Below is the completed PR; we send this
using <KBD>C-c C-c</KBD>.  (The comments have been truncated).

Got your message, Jeff.  It seems that the bifrabulator was 
confusing the prestidigitation routines with the realitychecker
when lexically parsing the whatsitsname.

I'm working on robustisizing the bifrabulator now.

How about lunch next week?
