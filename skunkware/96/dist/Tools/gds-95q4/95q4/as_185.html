<P>
The Motorola 680x0 version of <CODE>as</CODE> has a few machine
dependent options.
<A NAME="IDX577"></A>
<P>
You can use the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option to shorten the size of references to undefined
symbols.  If you do not use the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option, references to undefined
symbols are wide enough for a full <CODE>long</CODE> (32 bits).  (Since
<CODE>as</CODE> cannot know where these symbols end up, <CODE>as</CODE> can
only allocate space for the linker to fill in later.  Since <CODE>as</CODE>
does not know how far away these symbols are, it allocates as much space as it
can.)  If you use this option, the references are only one word wide (16 bits).
This may be useful if you want the object file to be as small as possible, and
you know that the relevant symbols are always less than 17 bits away.
<A NAME="IDX578"></A>
<P>
For some configurations, especially those where the compiler normally
does not prepend an underscore to the names of user variables, the
assembler requires a <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> before any use of a register name.  This
is intended to let the assembler distinguish between C variables and
functions named <SAMP>`a0'</SAMP> through <SAMP>`a7'</SAMP>, and so on.  The <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> is
always accepted, but is not required for certain configurations, notably
<SAMP>`sun3'</SAMP>.  The <SAMP>`--register-prefix-optional'</SAMP> option may be used
to permit omitting the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> even for configurations for which it is
normally required.  If this is done, it will generally be impossible to
refer to C variables and functions with the same names as register
names.

<CODE>as</CODE> can assemble code for several different members of the
Motorola 680x0 family.  The default depends upon how <CODE>as</CODE>
was configured when it was built; normally, the default is to assemble
code for the 68020 microprocessor.  The following options may be used to
change the default.  These options control which instructions and
addressing modes are permitted.  The members of the 680x0 family are
very similar.  For detailed information about the differences, see the
Motorola manuals.

<DT><SAMP>`-m68000'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`-m68008'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`-m68302'</SAMP>
<DD>Assemble for the 68000.  <SAMP>`-m68008'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-m68302'</SAMP> are synonyms
for <SAMP>`-m68000'</SAMP>, since the chips are the same from the point of view
of the assembler.

<DT><SAMP>`-m68010'</SAMP>
<DD>Assemble for the 68010.

<DT><SAMP>`-m68020'</SAMP>
<DD>Assemble for the 68020.  This is normally the default.

<DT><SAMP>`-m68030'</SAMP>
<DD>Assemble for the 68030.

<DT><SAMP>`-m68040'</SAMP>
<DD>Assemble for the 68040.

<DT><SAMP>`-m68060'</SAMP>
<DD>Assemble for the 68060.

<DD><DT><SAMP>`-m68340'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`-m68360'</SAMP>
<DD>Assemble for the CPU32 family of chips.

<DT><SAMP>`-m68881'</SAMP>
<DD><DT><SAMP>`-m68882'</SAMP>
<DD>Assemble 68881 floating point instructions.  This is the default for the
68020, 68030, and the CPU32.  The 68040 and 68060 always support
floating point instructions.

<DT><SAMP>`-mno-68881'</SAMP>
<DD>Do not assemble 68881 floating point instructions.  This is the default
for 68000 and the 68010.  The 68040 and 68060 always support floating
point instructions, even if this option is used.

<DT><SAMP>`-m68851'</SAMP>
<DD>Assemble 68851 MMU instructions.  This is the default for the 68020,
68030, and 68060.  The 68040 accepts a somewhat different set of MMU
instructions; <SAMP>`-m68851'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-m68040'</SAMP> should not be used
together.

<DT><SAMP>`-mno-68851'</SAMP>
<DD>Do not assemble 68851 MMU instructions.  This is the default for the
68000, 68010, and the CPU32.  The 68040 accepts a somewhat different set
of MMU instructions.
