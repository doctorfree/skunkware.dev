<P>
The names for reject files (files containing patches that <CODE>patch</CODE>
could not find a place to apply) are normally the name of the output
file with <SAMP>`.rej'</SAMP> appended (or <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> on systems that do not
support long file names).
<P>
Alternatively, you can tell <CODE>patch</CODE> to place all of the rejected
patches in a single file.  The <SAMP>`-r <VAR>reject-file</VAR>'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--reject-file=<VAR>reject-file</VAR>'</SAMP> option uses <VAR>reject-file</VAR> as
the reject file name.
