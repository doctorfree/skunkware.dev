<P>
Change the logical line number.  <VAR>line-number</VAR> must be an absolute
expression.  The next line has that logical line number.  Therefore any other
statements on the current line (after a statement separator character) are
reported as on logical line number <VAR>line-number</VAR> - 1.  One day
<CODE>as</CODE> will no longer support this directive: it is recognized only
for compatibility with existing assembler programs.
<P>
<EM>Warning:</EM> In the AMD29K configuration of as, this command is
not available; use the synonym <CODE>.ln</CODE> in that context.
<P>
Even though this is a directive associated with the <CODE>a.out</CODE> or
<CODE>b.out</CODE> object-code formats, <CODE>as</CODE> still recognizes it
when producing COFF output, and treats <SAMP>`.line'</SAMP> as though it
were the COFF <SAMP>`.ln'</SAMP> <EM>if</EM> it is found outside a
<CODE>.def</CODE>/<CODE>.endef</CODE> pair.
<P>
Inside a <CODE>.def</CODE>, <SAMP>`.line'</SAMP> is, instead, one of the directives
used by compilers to generate auxiliary symbol information for
debugging.
