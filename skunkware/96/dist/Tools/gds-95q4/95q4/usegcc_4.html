<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>This section is a political message from the League for Programming
Freedom to the users of GNU CC.  We have included it here because the
issue of interface copyright is important to the GNU project.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Apple and Lotus have tried to create a new form of legal monopoly: a
copyright on a user interface.
<P>
An interface is a kind of language--a set of conventions for
communication between two entities, human or machine.  Until a few years
ago, the law seemed clear: interfaces were outside the domain of
copyright, so programmers could program freely and implement whatever
interface the users demanded.  Imitating de-facto standard interfaces,
sometimes with improvements, was standard practice in the computer
field.  These improvements, if accepted by the users, caught on and
became the norm; in this way, much progress took place.
<P>
Computer users, and most software developers, were happy with this state
of affairs.  However, large companies such as Apple and Lotus would
prefer a different system--one in which they can own interfaces and
thereby rid themselves of all serious competitors.  They hope that
interface copyright will give them, in effect, monopolies on major
classes of software.
<P>
Other large companies such as IBM and Digital also favor interface
monopolies, for the same reason: if languages become property, they
expect to own many de-facto standard languages.  But Apple and Lotus are
the ones who have actually sued.  Lotus has won lawsuits against two
small companies, which were thus put out of business.  Then they sued
Borland; this case is now before the court of appeals.  Apple's lawsuit
against HP and Microsoft is also being decided by an appeals court.
Widespread rumors that Apple had lost the case are untrue; as of July
1994, the final outcome is unknown.
<P>
If the monopolists get their way, they will hobble the software field:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Gratuitous incompatibilities will burden users.  Imagine if each car
manufacturer had to design a different way to start, stop, and steer a
car.

<LI>
Users will be "locked in" to whichever interface they learn; then they
will be prisoners of one supplier, who will charge a monopolistic price.

<LI>
Large companies have an unfair advantage wherever lawsuits become
commonplace.  Since they can afford to sue, they can intimidate smaller
developers with threats even when they don't really have a case.

<LI>
Interface improvements will come slower, since incremental evolution
through creative partial imitation will no longer occur.
</UL>
<P>
If interface monopolies are accepted, other large companies are waiting
to grab theirs:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Adobe is expected to claim a monopoly on the interfaces of various popular
application programs, if Borland's appeal against Lotus fails.

<LI>
Open Computing magazine reported a Microsoft vice president as threatening
to sue people who copy the interface of Windows.
</UL>
<P>
Users invest a great deal of time and money in learning to use computer
interfaces.  Far more, in fact, than software developers invest in
developing <EM>and even implementing</EM> the interfaces.  Whoever can own
an interface, has made its users into captives, and misappropriated
their investment.
<P>
To protect our freedom from monopolies like these, a group of
programmers and users have formed a grass-roots political organization,
the League for Programming Freedom.
<P>
The purpose of the League is to oppose monopolistic practices such as
interface copyright and software patents.  The League calls for a return
to the legal policies of the recent past, in which programmers could
program freely.  The League is not concerned with free software as an
issue, and is not affiliated with the Free Software Foundation.
<P>
The League's activities include publicizing the issue, as is being done
here, and filing friend-of-the-court briefs on behalf of defendants sued
by monopolists.  Recently the League filed a friend-of-the-court brief
for Borland in its appeal against Lotus.
<P>
The League's membership rolls include John McCarthy, inventor of Lisp,
Marvin Minsky, founder of the MIT Artificial Intelligence lab, Guy L.
Steele, Jr., author of well-known books on Lisp and C, as well as
Richard Stallman, the developer of GNU CC.  Please join and add your
name to the list.  Membership dues in the League are $42 per year for
programmers, managers and professionals; $10.50 for students; $21 for
others.
<P>
Activist members are especially important, but members who have no time
to give are also important.  Surveys at major ACM conferences have
indicated a vast majority of attendees agree with the League.  If just
ten percent of the programmers who agree with the League join the
League, we will probably triumph.

In addition to joining the League, here are some suggestions from the
League for other things you can do to protect your freedom to write
programs:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Tell your friends and colleagues about this issue and how it threatens
to ruin the computer industry.

<LI>
Mention that you are a League member in your <TT>`.signature'</TT>, and
mention the League's email address for inquiries.

<LI>
Ask the companies you consider working for or working with to make
statements against software monopolies, and give preference to those
that do.

<LI>
When employers ask you to sign contracts giving them copyright or patent
rights, insist on clauses saying they can use these rights only
defensively.  Don't rely on "company policy," since that can change at
any time; don't rely on an individual executive's private word, since
that person may be replaced.  Get a commitment just as binding as the
commitment they get from you.

<LI>
Write to Congress to explain the importance of this issue.
