<P>
Most preprocessor features are active only if you use preprocessing directives
to request their use.
<P>
Preprocessing directives are lines in your program that start with <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>.
The <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> is followed by an identifier that is the <DFN>directive name</DFN>.
For example, <SAMP>`#define'</SAMP> is the directive that defines a macro.
Whitespace is also allowed before and after the <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>.
<P>
The set of valid directive names is fixed.  Programs cannot define new
preprocessing directives.
<P>
Some directive names require arguments; these make up the rest of the directive
line and must be separated from the directive name by whitespace.  For example,
<SAMP>`#define'</SAMP> must be followed by a macro name and the intended expansion
of the macro.  See section <A HREF="cpp_10.html#SEC11">Simple Macros</A>.
<P>
A preprocessing directive cannot be more than one line in normal circumstances.
It may be split cosmetically with Backslash-Newline, but that has no effect
on its meaning.  Comments containing Newlines can also divide the
directive into multiple lines, but the comments are changed to Spaces
before the directive is interpreted.  The only way a significant Newline
can occur in a preprocessing directive is within a string constant or
character constant.  Note that
most C compilers that might be applied to the output from the preprocessor
do not accept string or character constants containing Newlines.
<P>
The <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> and the directive name cannot come from a macro expansion.  For
example, if <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> is defined as a macro expanding to <SAMP>`define'</SAMP>,
that does not make <SAMP>`#foo'</SAMP> a valid preprocessing directive.
