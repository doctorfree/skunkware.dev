<P>
If you have problems with GNU <CODE>make</CODE> or think you've found a bug,
please report it to the developers; we cannot promise to do anything but
we might well want to fix it.
<P>
Before reporting a bug, make sure you've actually found a real bug.
Carefully reread the documentation and see if it really says you can do
what you're trying to do.  If it's not clear whether you should be able
to do something or not, report that too; it's a bug in the
documentation!
<P>
Before reporting a bug or trying to fix it yourself, try to isolate it
to the smallest possible makefile that reproduces the problem.  Then
send us the makefile and the exact results <CODE>make</CODE> gave you.  Also
say what you expected to occur; this will help us decide whether the
problem was really in the documentation.
<P>
Once you've got a precise problem, please send electronic mail either
through the Internet or via UUCP:
<P>
<PRE>
Internet address:
    bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu

UUCP path:
    mit-eddie!prep.ai.mit.edu!bug-gnu-utils
</PRE>
<P>
Please include the version number of <CODE>make</CODE> you are using.  You can
get this information with the command <SAMP>`make --version'</SAMP>.
Be sure also to include the type of machine and operating system you are
using.  If possible, include the contents of the file <TT>`config.h'</TT>
that is generated by the configuration process.
<P>
Non-bug suggestions are always welcome as well.  If you have questions
about things that are unclear in the documentation or are just obscure
features, send a message to the bug reporting address.  We cannot
guarantee you'll get help with your problem, but many seasoned
<CODE>make</CODE> users read the mailing list and they will probably try to
help you out.  The maintainers sometimes answer such questions as well,
when time permits.
