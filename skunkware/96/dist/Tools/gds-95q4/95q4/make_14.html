<H2><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC13">What Makefiles Contain</A></H2>
<P>
Makefiles contain five kinds of things: <DFN>explicit rules</DFN>,
<DFN>implicit rules</DFN>, <DFN>variable definitions</DFN>, <DFN>directives</DFN>,
and <DFN>comments</DFN>.  Rules, variables, and directives are described at
length in later chapters.<P>
<A NAME="IDX49"></A>
<A NAME="IDX50"></A>
<UL>
<LI>
An <DFN>explicit rule</DFN> says when and how to remake one or more files,
called the rule's targets.  It lists the other files that the targets
<DFN>depend on</DFN>, and may also give commands to use to create or update
the targets.  See section <A HREF="make_20.html#SEC19">Writing Rules</A>.

<A NAME="IDX52"></A>
<A NAME="IDX51"></A>
<LI>
An <DFN>implicit rule</DFN> says when and how to remake a class of files
based on their names.  It describes how a target may depend on a file
with a name similar to the target and gives commands to create or
update such a target.  See section <A HREF="make_87.html#SEC86">Using Implicit Rules</A>.

<A NAME="IDX53"></A>
<LI>
A <DFN>variable definition</DFN> is a line that specifies a text string
value for a variable that can be substituted into the text later.  The
simple makefile example shows a variable definition for <CODE>objects</CODE>
as a list of all object files (see section <A HREF="make_9.html#SEC8">Variables Make Makefiles Simpler</A>).

<A NAME="IDX54"></A>
<LI>
A <DFN>directive</DFN> is a command for <CODE>make</CODE> to do something special while
reading the makefile.  These include:

<UL>
<LI>
Reading another makefile (see section <A HREF="make_16.html#SEC15">Including Other Makefiles</A>).

<LI>
Deciding (based on the values of variables) whether to use or
ignore a part of the makefile (see section <A HREF="make_68.html#SEC67">Conditional Parts of Makefiles</A>).

<LI>
Defining a variable from a verbatim string containing multiple lines
(see section <A HREF="make_66.html#SEC65">Defining Variables Verbatim</A>).
</UL>

<A NAME="IDX56"></A>
<A NAME="IDX55"></A>
<LI>
<SAMP>`#'</SAMP> in a line of a makefile starts a <DFN>comment</DFN>.  It and the rest of
the line are ignored, except that a trailing backslash not escaped by
another backslash will continue the comment across multiple lines.
Comments may appear on any of the lines in the makefile, except within a
<CODE>define</CODE> directive, and perhaps within commands (where the shell
decides what is a comment).  A line containing just a comment (with
perhaps spaces before it) is effectively blank, and is ignored.</UL>
