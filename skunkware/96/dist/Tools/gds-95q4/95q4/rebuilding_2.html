<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="rebuilding_toc.html#SEC1">Configuration</A></H1>

<P>
The first and most important step in preparing source code to run on
your system is to <STRONG>configure</STRONG> it so that, when built, the program
exhibits the behavior you expect.  The configuration process involves
preparing a <STRONG>Makefile</STRONG> which contains default and/or customized
information for your site and for your hardware/software system.  If you
are building the distribution for more than one platform, you must
configure, compile, and install on each platform.

</P>
<P>
You can configure the software in this release by using the shell script
<CODE>configure</CODE>.  The shell script accepts one argument, the <STRONG>host
type</STRONG>, although if you do not supply it <CODE>configure</CODE> is able to
determine it under most circumstances
(see section <A HREF="rebuilding_7.html#SEC6"><CODE>config.guess</CODE></A>).  In fact, in most cases we
recommend you <STRONG>not</STRONG> specify the type of host.

</P>
<P>
There are also several possible options, including a <SAMP>`--target='</SAMP>
option to configure for cross-system development.  For various examples
of these options, see section <A HREF="rebuilding_12.html#SEC11">Examples and suggestions</A>.

</P>
<P>
Your Developer's Kit contains full online documentation for Cygnus
<CODE>configure</CODE>.  See section `Using <CODE>configure</CODE>' in <CITE>Cygnus <CODE>configure</CODE></CITE>, to read about
<CODE>configure</CODE> in more detail, including information on how the
<CODE>configure</CODE> options are related to <TT>`Makefile'</TT> variables.
