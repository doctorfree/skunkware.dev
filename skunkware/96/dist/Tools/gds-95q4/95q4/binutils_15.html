<P>
You can specify three aspects of the target system to the GNU
binary file utilities, each in several ways:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
the target

<LI>
the architecture

<LI>
the linker emulation (which applies to the linker only)
</UL>
<P>
In the following summaries, the lists of ways to specify values are in
order of decreasing precedence.  The ways listed first override those
listed later.
<P>
The commands to list valid values only list the values for which the
programs you are running were configured.  If they were configured with
<SAMP>`--with-targets=all'</SAMP>, the commands list most of the available
values, but a few are left out; not all targets can be configured in at
once because some of them can only be configured <DFN>native</DFN> (on hosts
with the same type as the target system).
