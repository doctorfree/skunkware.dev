<P>
To compile and run a program using a cross-compiler involves several
steps:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Run the cross-compiler on the host machine to produce assembler files
for the target machine.  This requires header files for the target
machine.

<LI>
Assemble the files produced by the cross-compiler.  You can do this
either with an assembler on the target machine, or with a
cross-assembler on the host machine.

<LI>
Link those files to make an executable.  You can do this either with a
linker on the target machine, or with a cross-linker on the host
machine.  Whichever machine you use, you need libraries and certain
startup files (typically <TT>`crt....o'</TT>) for the target machine.
</UL>
<P>
It is most convenient to do all of these steps on the same host machine,
since then you can do it all with a single invocation of GNU CC.  This
requires a suitable cross-assembler and cross-linker.  For some targets,
the GNU assembler and linker are available.
