<H3><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC26"><CODE>VPATH</CODE>: Search Path for All Dependencies</A></H3>
<P>
The value of the <CODE>make</CODE> variable <CODE>VPATH</CODE> specifies a list of
directories that <CODE>make</CODE> should search.  Most often, the
directories are expected to contain dependency files that are not in the
current directory; however, <CODE>VPATH</CODE> specifies a search list that
<CODE>make</CODE> applies for all files, including files which are targets of
rules.
<P>
Thus, if a file that is listed as a target or dependency does not exist
in the current directory, <CODE>make</CODE> searches the directories listed in
<CODE>VPATH</CODE> for a file with that name.  If a file is found in one of
them, that file becomes the dependency.  Rules may then specify the
names of source files in the dependencies as if they all existed in the
current directory.  See section <A HREF="make_29.html#SEC28">Writing Shell Commands with Directory Search</A>.
<P>
In the <CODE>VPATH</CODE> variable, directory names are separated by colons or
blanks.  The order in which directories are listed is the order followed
by <CODE>make</CODE> in its search.
<P>
For example,
<P>
<PRE>
VPATH = src:../headers
</PRE>
<P>
specifies a path containing two directories, <TT>`src'</TT> and
<TT>`../headers'</TT>, which <CODE>make</CODE> searches in that order.
<P>
With this value of <CODE>VPATH</CODE>, the following rule,
<P>
<PRE>
foo.o : foo.c
</PRE>
<P>
is interpreted as if it were written like this:
<P>
<PRE>
foo.o : src/foo.c
</PRE>
<P>
assuming the file <TT>`foo.c'</TT> does not exist in the current directory but
is found in the directory <TT>`src'</TT>.
