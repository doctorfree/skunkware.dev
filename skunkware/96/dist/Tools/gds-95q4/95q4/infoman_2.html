<P>
The info file version of a manual is organized into <DFN>nodes</DFN>, which
usually correspond to the chapters and sections of the printed book.  You
can follow them in sequence, if you wish, just like in the printed
book--but there are also other choices.  Info files have menus that
let you go quickly to the node that has the information you need.
Info has "hot" references; if one section refers to another,
you can tell Info to take you immediately to that other
section--and you can get back again easily to take up your reading
where you left off.  Naturally, you can also search for particular words
or phrases.

The best way to get started with the online documentation system is to
use a programmed tutorial by running Info itself.  You can get into
Info by just typing its name--no options or arguments are
necessary--at your shell's prompt (shown as <SAMP>`eg$'</SAMP> here):
<P>
<PRE>
eg$ info
</PRE>
<P>
Info displays its first screen, a menu of the documentation
available, and awaits your input.  Type the single letter
<P>
<PRE>
h
</PRE>
<P>
to request a tutorial, designed to teach you how to use Info.
<P>
If you already use Emacs, you may want to get into the documentation
browsing mode, instead, by typing <KBD>C-h i</KBD> inside Emacs.
<P>
You can get out of Info at any time by typing the single letter
<KBD>q</KBD>.

Info can also display a summary of all its commands at any time, when
you type the single character <KBD>?</KBD>.

<H2>What is Info?</H2>
<P>
This text documents the use of the GNU Info program, version
2.9.

<DFN>Info</DFN> is a program which is used to view info files on an ASCII
terminal. <DFN>info files</DFN> are the result of processing texinfo files
with the program <CODE>makeinfo</CODE> or with  the Emacs command <CODE>M-x
texinfo-format-buffer</CODE>.  Finally, <DFN>texinfo</DFN> is a documentation
language which allows a printed manual and online documentation (an info
file) to be produced from a single source file.
