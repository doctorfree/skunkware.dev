<P>
GNU CC by itself attempts to be what the ISO/ANSI C standard calls a
<DFN>conforming freestanding implementation</DFN>.  This means all ANSI
C language features are available, as well as the contents of
<TT>`float.h'</TT>, <TT>`limits.h'</TT>, <TT>`stdarg.h'</TT>, and
<TT>`stddef.h'</TT>.  The rest of the C library is supplied by the
vendor of the operating system.  If that C library doesn't conform to
the C standards, then your programs might get warnings (especially when
using <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>) that you don't expect.
<P>
For example, the <CODE>sprintf</CODE> function on SunOS 4.1.3 returns
<CODE>char *</CODE> while the C standard says that <CODE>sprintf</CODE> returns an
<CODE>int</CODE>.  The <CODE>fixincludes</CODE> program could make the prototype for
this function match the Standard, but that would be wrong, since the
function will still return <CODE>char *</CODE>.
<P>
If you need a Standard compliant library, then you need to find one, as
GNU CC does not provide one.  The GNU C library (called <CODE>glibc</CODE>)
has been ported to a number of operating systems, and provides ANSI/ISO,
POSIX, BSD and SystemV compatibility.  You could also ask your operating
system vendor if newer libraries are available.
