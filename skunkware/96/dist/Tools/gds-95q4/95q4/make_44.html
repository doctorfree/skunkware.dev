<H2><A NAME="SEC43" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC43">Command Echoing</A></H2>
<P>
Normally <CODE>make</CODE> prints each command line before it is executed.
We call this <DFN>echoing</DFN> because it gives the appearance that you
are typing the commands yourself.
<P>
When a line starts with <SAMP>`@'</SAMP>, the echoing of that line is suppressed.
The <SAMP>`@'</SAMP> is discarded before the command is passed to the shell.
Typically you would use this for a command whose only effect is to print
something, such as an <CODE>echo</CODE> command to indicate progress through
the makefile:
<P>
<PRE>
@echo About to make distribution files
</PRE>
<A NAME="IDX238"></A>
<A NAME="IDX239"></A>
<A NAME="IDX240"></A>
<A NAME="IDX241"></A>
<P>
When <CODE>make</CODE> is given the flag <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--just-print'</SAMP>,
echoing is all that happens, no execution.  See section <A HREF="make_86.html#SEC85">Summary of Options</A>.  In this case and only this case, even the
commands starting with <SAMP>`@'</SAMP> are printed.  This flag is useful for
finding out which commands <CODE>make</CODE> thinks are necessary without
actually doing them.

<A NAME="IDX243"></A>
<A NAME="IDX244"></A>
<A NAME="IDX245"></A>
<P>
The <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--silent'</SAMP>
flag to <CODE>make</CODE> prevents all echoing, as if all commands
started with <SAMP>`@'</SAMP>.  A rule in the makefile for the special target
<CODE>.SILENT</CODE> without dependencies has the same effect 
(see section <A HREF="make_35.html#SEC34">Special Built-in Target Names</A>).
<CODE>.SILENT</CODE> is essentially obsolete since <SAMP>`@'</SAMP> is more flexible.<P>
