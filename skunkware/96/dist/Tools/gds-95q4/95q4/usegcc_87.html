<H2><A NAME="SEC90" HREF="usegcc_toc.html#TOC90">Specifying Attributes of Types</A></H2>
<P>
The keyword <CODE>__attribute__</CODE> allows you to specify special
attributes of <CODE>struct</CODE> and <CODE>union</CODE> types when you define such
types.  This keyword is followed by an attribute specification inside
double parentheses.  Three attributes are currently defined for types:
<CODE>aligned</CODE>, <CODE>packed</CODE>, and <CODE>transparent_union</CODE>.  Other
attributes are defined for functions (see section <A HREF="usegcc_79.html#SEC82">Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>) and
for variables (see section <A HREF="usegcc_86.html#SEC89">Specifying Attributes of Variables</A>).
<P>
You may also specify any one of these attributes with <SAMP>`__'</SAMP>
preceding and following its keyword.  This allows you to use these
attributes in header files without being concerned about a possible
macro of the same name.  For example, you may use <CODE>__aligned__</CODE>
instead of <CODE>aligned</CODE>.
<P>
You may specify the <CODE>aligned</CODE> and <CODE>transparent_union</CODE>
attributes either in a <CODE>typedef</CODE> declaration or just past the
closing curly brace of a complete enum, struct or union type
<EM>definition</EM> and the <CODE>packed</CODE> attribute only past the closing
brace of a definition.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>aligned (<VAR>alignment</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>This attribute specifies a minimum alignment (in bytes) for variables
of the specified type.  For example, the declarations:

<PRE>
struct S { short f[3]; } __attribute__
                          ((aligned (8));
typedef int more_aligned_int __attribute__
                          ((aligned (8));
</PRE>

force the compiler to insure (as fas as it can) that each variable whose
type is <CODE>struct S</CODE> or <CODE>more_aligned_int</CODE> will be allocated and
aligned <EM>at least</EM> on a 8-byte boundary.  On a Sparc, having all
variables of type <CODE>struct S</CODE> aligned to 8-byte boundaries allows
the compiler to use the <CODE>ldd</CODE> and <CODE>std</CODE> (doubleword load and
store) instructions when copying one variable of type <CODE>struct S</CODE> to
another, thus improving run-time efficiency.

Note that the alignment of any given <CODE>struct</CODE> or <CODE>union</CODE> type
is required by the ANSI C standard to be at least a perfect multiple of
the lowest common multiple of the alignments of all of the members of
the <CODE>struct</CODE> or <CODE>union</CODE> in question.  This means that you <EM>can</EM>
effectively adjust the alignment of a <CODE>struct</CODE> or <CODE>union</CODE>
type by attaching an <CODE>aligned</CODE> attribute to any one of the members
of such a type, but the notation illustrated in the example above is a
more obvious, intuitive, and readable way to request the compiler to
adjust the alignment of an entire <CODE>struct</CODE> or <CODE>union</CODE> type.

As in the preceding example, you can explicitly specify the alignment
(in bytes) that you wish the compiler to use for a given <CODE>struct</CODE>
or <CODE>union</CODE> type.  Alternatively, you can leave out the alignment factor
and just ask the compiler to align a type to the maximum
useful alignment for the target machine you are compiling for.  For
example, you could write:

<PRE>
struct S { short f[3]; } __attribute__ ((aligned));
</PRE>

Whenever you leave out the alignment factor in an <CODE>aligned</CODE>
attribute specification, the compiler automatically sets the alignment
for the type to the largest alignment which is ever used for any data
type on the target machine you are compiling for.  Doing this can often
make copy operations more efficient, because the compiler can use
whatever instructions copy the biggest chunks of memory when performing
copies to or from the variables which have types that you have aligned
this way.

In the example above, if the size of each <CODE>short</CODE> is 2 bytes, then
the size of the entire <CODE>struct S</CODE> type is 6 bytes.  The smallest
power of two which is greater than or equal to that is 8, so the
compiler sets the alignment for the entire <CODE>struct S</CODE> type to 8
bytes.

Note that although you can ask the compiler to select a time-efficient
alignment for a given type and then declare only individual stand-alone
objects of that type, the compiler's ability to select a time-efficient
alignment is primarily useful only when you plan to create arrays of
variables having the relevant (efficiently aligned) type.  If you
declare or use arrays of variables of an efficiently-aligned type, then
it is likely that your program will also be doing pointer arithmetic (or
subscripting, which amounts to the same thing) on pointers to the
relevant type, and the code that the compiler generates for these
pointer arithmetic operations will often be more efficient for
efficiently-aligned types than for other types.

The <CODE>aligned</CODE> attribute can only increase the alignment; but you
can decrease it by specifying <CODE>packed</CODE> as well.  See below.

Note that the effectiveness of <CODE>aligned</CODE> attributes may be limited
by inherent limitations in your linker.  On many systems, the linker is
only able to arrange for variables to be aligned up to a certain maximum
alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum supported alignment may
be very very small.)  If your linker is only able to align variables
up to a maximum of 8 byte alignment, then specifying <CODE>aligned(16)</CODE>
in an <CODE>__attribute__</CODE> will still only provide you with 8 byte
alignment.  See your linker documentation for further information.

<DT><CODE>packed</CODE>
<DD>This attribute, attached to an <CODE>enum</CODE>, <CODE>struct</CODE>, or
<CODE>union</CODE> type definition, specified that the minimum required memory
be used to represent the type.

Specifying this attribute for <CODE>struct</CODE> and <CODE>union</CODE> types is
equivalent to specifying the <CODE>packed</CODE> attribute on each of the
structure or union members.  Specifying the <SAMP>`-fshort-enums'</SAMP>
flag on the line is equivalent to specifying the <CODE>packed</CODE>
attribute on all <CODE>enum</CODE> definitions.

You may only specify this attribute after a closing curly brace on an
<CODE>enum</CODE> definition, not in a <CODE>typedef</CODE> declaration.

<DT><CODE>transparent_union</CODE>
<DD>This attribute, attached to a <CODE>union</CODE> type definition, indicates
that any variable having that union type should, if passed to a
function, be passed in the same way that the first union member would be
passed.  For example:

<PRE>
union foo
{
  char a;
  int x[2];
} __attribute__ ((transparent_union));
</PRE>
</DL>
<P>
To specify multiple attributes, separate them by commas within the
double parentheses: for example, <SAMP>`__attribute__ ((aligned (16),
packed))'</SAMP>.
