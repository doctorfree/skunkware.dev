<P>
The C, C++, and Objective C versions of the compiler are integrated; the
GNU C compiler can compile programs written in C, C++, or Objective C.
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>
<P>
"<CODE>gcc</CODE>" is a common shorthand term for the GNU C compiler.  This is both
the most general name for the compiler, and the name used when the
emphasis is on compiling C programs.
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
<P>
When referring to C++ compilation, it is usual to call the compiler
"G++".  Since there is only one compiler, it is also accurate to call
it "<CODE>gcc</CODE>" no matter what the language context; however, the term
"G++" is more useful when the emphasis is on compiling C++ programs.
<P>
We use the name "GNU CC" to refer to the compilation system as a
whole, and more specifically to the language-independent part of the
compiler.  For example, we refer to the optimization options as
affecting the behavior of "GNU CC" or sometimes just "the compiler".
<P>
Front ends for other languages, such as Ada 9X, Fortran, Modula-3, and
Pascal, are under development.  These front-ends, like that for C++, are
built in subdirectories of GNU CC and link to it.  The result is an
integrated compiler that can compile programs written in C, C++,
Objective C, or any of the languages for which you have installed front
ends.
<P>
In this manual, we only discuss the options for the C, Objective-C, and
C++ compilers and those of the GNU CC core.  Consult the documentation
of the other front ends for the options to use when compiling programs
written in other languages.

<P>
G++ is a <EM>compiler</EM>, not merely a preprocessor.  G++ builds object
code directly from your C++ program source.  There is no intermediate C
version of the program.  (By contrast, for example, some other
implementations use a program that generates a C program from your C++
source.)  Avoiding an intermediate C representation of the program means
that you get better object code, and better debugging information.  The
GNU debugger, GDB, works with this information in the object code to
give you comprehensive C++ source-level editing capabilities
(see section `C and C++' in <CITE>Debugging with GDB</CITE>).
