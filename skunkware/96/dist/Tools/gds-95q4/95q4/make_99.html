<P>
You can define a last-resort implicit rule by writing a terminal
match-anything pattern rule with no dependencies (see section <A HREF="make_97.html#SEC96">Match-Anything Pattern Rules</A>).  This is just like any other pattern rule; the only thing
special about it is that it will match any target.  So such a rule's
commands are used for all targets and dependencies that have no commands
of their own and for which no other implicit rule applies.
<P>
For example, when testing a makefile, you might not care if the source
files contain real data, only that they exist.  Then you might do this:
<P>
<PRE>
%::
        touch $@
</PRE>
<P>
to cause all the source files needed (as dependencies) to be created
automatically.
<A NAME="IDX818"></A>
<P>
You can instead define commands to be used for targets for which there
are no rules at all, even ones which don't specify commands.  You do
this by writing a rule for the target <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE>.  Such a rule's
commands are used for all dependencies which do not appear as targets in
any explicit rule, and for which no implicit rule applies.  Naturally,
there is no <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE> rule unless you write one.
<P>
If you use <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE> with no commands or dependencies:
<P>
<PRE>
.DEFAULT:
</PRE>
<P>
the commands previously stored for <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE> are cleared.
Then <CODE>make</CODE> acts as if you had never defined <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE> at all.
<P>
If you do not want a target to get the commands from a match-anything
pattern rule or <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE>, but you also do not want any commands
to be run for the target, you can give it empty commands (see section <A HREF="make_55.html#SEC54">Using Empty Commands</A>).<P>
You can use a last-resort rule to override part of another makefile.
See section <A HREF="make_19.html#SEC18">Overriding Part of Another Makefile</A>.
