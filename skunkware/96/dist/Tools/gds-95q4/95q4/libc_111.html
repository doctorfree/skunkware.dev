<H1><A NAME="SEC111" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC111">Signal Handling (<TT>`signal.h'</TT>)</A></H1>
<P>
A <DFN>signal</DFN> is an event that interrupts the normal flow of control
in your program.  Your operating environment normally defines the full
set of signals available (see <TT>`sys/signal.h'</TT>), as well as the
default means of dealing with them--typically, either printing an
error message and aborting your program, or ignoring the signal.
<P>
All systems support at least the following signals:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>SIGABRT</CODE>
<DD>Abnormal termination of a program; raised by the &#60;&#60;abort&#62;&#62; function.

<DT><CODE>SIGFPE</CODE>
<DD>A domain error in arithmetic, such as overflow, or division by zero.

<DT><CODE>SIGILL</CODE>
<DD>Attempt to execute as a function data that is not executable.

<DT><CODE>SIGINT</CODE>
<DD>Interrupt; an interactive attention signal.

<DT><CODE>SIGSEGV</CODE>
<DD>An attempt to access a memory location that is not available.

<DT><CODE>SIGTERM</CODE>
<DD>A request that your program end execution.
</DL>
<P>
Two functions are available for dealing with asynchronous
signals--one to allow your program to send signals to itself (this is
called <DFN>raising</DFN> a signal), and one to specify subroutines (called
<DFN>handlers</DFN> to handle particular signals that you anticipate may
occur--whether raised by your own program or the operating environment.
<P>
To support these functions, <TT>`signal.h'</TT> defines three macros:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>SIG_DFL</CODE>
<DD>Used with the <CODE>signal</CODE> function in place of a pointer to a
handler subroutine, to select the operating environment's default
handling of a signal.

<DT><CODE>SIG_IGN</CODE>
<DD>Used with the <CODE>signal</CODE> function in place of a pointer to a
handler, to ignore a particular signal.

<DT><CODE>SIG_ERR</CODE>
<DD>Returned by the <CODE>signal</CODE> function in place of a pointer to a
handler, to indicate that your request to set up a handler could not
be honored for some reason.
</DL>
<P>
<TT>`signal.h'</TT> also defines an integral type, <CODE>sig_atomic_t</CODE>.
This type is not used in any function declarations; it exists only to
allow your signal handlers to declare a static storage location where
they may store a signal value.  (Static storage is not otherwise
reliable from signal handlers.)
