<H4><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="rebuilding_toc.html#SEC15">Setting links after installation</A></H4>

<P>
We recommend setting two links after building the Heterogeneous
Updateable Toolkit.  One makes the toolkit easily updateable; the other
makes the tools available in a heterogeneous network environment.
<EM>Note:</EM> If you choose not to set the links in place, you must set
your <CODE>PATH</CODE> according to the value you choose for
<VAR>exec-prefix</VAR>.
