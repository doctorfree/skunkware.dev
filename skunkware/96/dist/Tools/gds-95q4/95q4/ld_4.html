<P>
You can change the behavior of <CODE>ld</CODE> with the environment
variable <CODE>GNUTARGET</CODE>.  
<A NAME="IDX127"></A>
<A NAME="IDX128"></A>
<P>
<CODE>GNUTARGET</CODE> determines the input-file object format if you don't
use <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> (or its synonym <SAMP>`-format'</SAMP>).  Its value should be one
of the BFD names for an input format (see section <A HREF="ld_26.html#SEC26">BFD</A>).  If there is no
<CODE>GNUTARGET</CODE> in the environment, <CODE>ld</CODE> uses the natural format
of the target. If <CODE>GNUTARGET</CODE> is set to <CODE>default</CODE> then BFD attempts to discover the
input format by examining binary input files; this method often
succeeds, but there are potential ambiguities, since there is no method
of ensuring that the magic number used to specify object-file formats is
unique.  However, the configuration procedure for BFD on each system
places the conventional format for that system first in the search-list,
so ambiguities are resolved in favor of convention.
