<P>
AIX on the RS/6000 provides National Language Support
(NLS) for environments outside of the United States.  Compilers and
assemblers use NLS to support locale-specific representations of
various objects including floating-point numbers (<SAMP>`.'</SAMP> vs <SAMP>`,'</SAMP>
for separating decimal fractions).  There have been problems reported
where the library linked with GCC does not produce the same
floating-point formats that the assembler accepts.  If you have this
problem, set the <CODE>LANG</CODE> environment variable to either <SAMP>`C'</SAMP>
(the C language locale) or <SAMP>`En_US'</SAMP> (the American English locale);
either value should work.
