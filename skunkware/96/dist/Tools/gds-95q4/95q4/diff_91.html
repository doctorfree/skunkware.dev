<P>
It would be nice to have a feature for specifying two strings, one in
<VAR>from-file</VAR> and one in <VAR>to-file</VAR>, which should be considered to
match.  Thus, if the two strings are <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`bar'</SAMP>, then if
two lines differ only in that <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> in file 1 corresponds to
<SAMP>`bar'</SAMP> in file 2, the lines are treated as identical.
<P>
It is not clear how general this feature can or should be, or
what syntax should be used for it.
