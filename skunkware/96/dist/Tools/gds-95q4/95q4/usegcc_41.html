<H2><A NAME="SEC44" HREF="usegcc_toc.html#TOC44">Environment Variables Affecting GNU CC</A></H2>
<P>
This section describes several environment variables that affect how GNU
CC operates.  They work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.
<P>
Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
<SAMP>`-B'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="usegcc_18.html#SEC21">Options for Directory Search</A>).  These
take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of GNU
CC. 
<P>
<A NAME="IDX213"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>TMPDIR</CODE>
<DD>If <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  GNU CC uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.

<A NAME="IDX214"></A>
<DT><CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>
<DD>If <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE> is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.

If GNU CC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.

The default of <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE> is
<TT>`<VAR>prefix</VAR>/lib/gcc-lib/'</TT>, where <VAR>prefix</VAR> is the value
of <CODE>prefix</CODE> when you ran the <TT>`configure'</TT> script.

Other prefixes specified with <SAMP>`-B'</SAMP> take precedence over this prefix.

This prefix is also used for finding files such as <TT>`crt0.o'</TT> that are
used for linking.

In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with <SAMP>`/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib'</SAMP>
(more precisely, with the value of <CODE>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>), GNU CC tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with <SAMP>`-Bfoo/'</SAMP>, GNU CC will search
<TT>`foo/bar'</TT> where it would normally search <TT>`/usr/local/lib/bar'</TT>.
These alternate directories are searched first; the standard directories
come next.

<A NAME="IDX215"></A>
<DT><CODE>COMPILER_PATH</CODE>
<DD>The value of <CODE>COMPILER_PATH</CODE> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <CODE>PATH</CODE>.  GNU CC tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
subprograms using <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX216"></A>
<DT><CODE>LIBRARY_PATH</CODE>
<DD>The value of <CODE>LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <CODE>PATH</CODE>.  When configured as a native compiler,
GNU CC tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it can't find them using <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>.  Linking
using GNU CC also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option (but directories specified with
<SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> come first).

<DT><CODE>C_INCLUDE_PATH</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX217"></A>
<A NAME="IDX218"></A>
<A NAME="IDX219"></A>
<DT><CODE>OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH</CODE>
<DD>These environment variables pertain to particular languages.  Each
variable's value is a colon-separated list of directories, much like
<CODE>PATH</CODE>.  When GNU CC searches for header files, it tries the
directories listed in the variable for the language you are using, after
the directories specified with <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> but before the standard header
file directories.

<A NAME="IDX220"></A>
<A NAME="IDX221"></A>
<DT><CODE>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</CODE>
<DD>If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output dependencies
for Make based on the header files processed by the compiler.  This
output looks much like the output from the <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> option
(see section <A HREF="usegcc_15.html#SEC18">Options Controlling the Preprocessor</A>), but it goes to a separate file, and is
in addition to the usual results of compilation.

The value of <CODE>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</CODE> can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
<SAMP>`<VAR>file</VAR> <VAR>target</VAR>'</SAMP>, in which case the rules are written to
file <VAR>file</VAR> using <VAR>target</VAR> as the target name.
