<P>
<CODE>config.guess</CODE> is a shell script which attempts to deduce the host
type from which it is called, using system commands like <CODE>uname</CODE> if
they are available.  <CODE>config.guess</CODE> is remarkably adept at
deciphering the proper configuration for your host; if you are building
a tree to run on the same host on which you're building it, we recommend
<EM>not</EM> specifying the <VAR>hosttype</VAR> argument.
<P>
<CODE>config.guess</CODE> is called by <CODE>configure</CODE>; you need never run it
by hand, unless you're curious about the output.
