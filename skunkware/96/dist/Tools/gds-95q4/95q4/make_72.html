<P>
<DFN>Functions</DFN> allow you to do text processing in the makefile to compute
the files to operate on or the commands to use.  You use a function in a
<DFN>function call</DFN>, where you give the name of the function and some text
(the <DFN>arguments</DFN>) for the function to operate on.  The result of the
function's processing is substituted into the makefile at the point of the
call, just as a variable might be substituted.
