<P>
Each PR goes through a defined series of states between origination and
closure.  The originator of a PR receives notification automatically of
any state changes.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DFN>open</DFN>
<DD>The initial state of a Problem Report.  This means the PR has been filed
and the responsible person(s) notified.

<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
<DT><DFN>analyzed</DFN>
<DD>The responsible person has analyzed the problem.  The analysis should
contain a preliminary evaluation of the problem and an estimate of the
amount of time and resources necessary to solve the problem.  It should
also suggest possible workarounds.

<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
<DT><DFN>feedback</DFN>
<DD>The problem has been solved, and the originator has been given a patch
or other fix.  The PR remains in this state until the originator
acknowledges that the solution works.

<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<DT><DFN>closed</DFN>
<DD>A Problem Report is closed ("the bug stops here") only when any
changes have been integrated, documented, and tested, and the submitter
has confirmed the solution.

<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
<DT><DFN>suspended</DFN>
<DD>Work on the problem has been postponed.  This happens if a timely
solution is not possible or is not cost-effective at the present time.
The PR continues to exist, though a solution is not being actively
sought.  If the problem cannot be solved at all, it should be closed
rather than suspended.
