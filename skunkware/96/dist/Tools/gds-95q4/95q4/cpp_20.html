<P>
Recall that when a macro is called with arguments, the arguments are
substituted into the macro body and the result is checked, together with
the rest of the input file, for more macro calls.
<P>
It is possible to piece together a macro call coming partially from the
macro body and partially from the actual arguments.  For example,
<P>
<PRE>
#define double(x) (2*(x))
#define call_with_1(x) x(1)
</PRE>
<P>
would expand <SAMP>`call_with_1 (double)'</SAMP> into <SAMP>`(2*(1))'</SAMP>.
<P>
Macro definitions do not have to have balanced parentheses.  By writing an
unbalanced open parenthesis in a macro body, it is possible to create a
macro call that begins inside the macro body but ends outside of it.  For
example,
<P>
<PRE>
#define strange(file) fprintf (file, "%s %d",
...
strange(stderr) p, 35)
</PRE>
<P>
This bizarre example expands to <SAMP>`fprintf (stderr, "%s %d", p, 35)'</SAMP>!
