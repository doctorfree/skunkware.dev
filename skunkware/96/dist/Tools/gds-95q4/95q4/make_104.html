<H2><A NAME="SEC103" HREF="make_toc.html#TOC103">Implicit Rule for Archive Member Targets</A></H2>
<P>
Recall that a target that looks like <TT>`<VAR>a</VAR>(<VAR>m</VAR>)'</TT> stands for the
member named <VAR>m</VAR> in the archive file <VAR>a</VAR>.
<P>
When <CODE>make</CODE> looks for an implicit rule for such a target, as a special
feature it considers implicit rules that match <TT>`(<VAR>m</VAR>)'</TT>, as well as
those that match the actual target <TT>`<VAR>a</VAR>(<VAR>m</VAR>)'</TT>.
<P>
This causes one special rule whose target is <TT>`(%)'</TT> to match.  This
rule updates the target <TT>`<VAR>a</VAR>(<VAR>m</VAR>)'</TT> by copying the file <VAR>m</VAR>
into the archive.  For example, it will update the archive member target
<TT>`foo.a(bar.o)'</TT> by copying the <EM>file</EM> <TT>`bar.o'</TT> into the
archive <TT>`foo.a'</TT> as a <EM>member</EM> named <TT>`bar.o'</TT>.
<P>
When this rule is chained with others, the result is very powerful.
Thus, <SAMP>`make "foo.a(bar.o)"'</SAMP> (the quotes are needed to protect the
<SAMP>`('</SAMP> and <SAMP>`)'</SAMP> from being interpreted specially by the shell) in
the presence of a file <TT>`bar.c'</TT> is enough to cause the following
commands to be run, even without a makefile:
<P>
<PRE>
cc -c bar.c -o bar.o
ar r foo.a bar.o
rm -f bar.o
</PRE>
<P>
Here <CODE>make</CODE> has envisioned the file <TT>`bar.o'</TT> as an intermediate
file.  See section <A HREF="make_91.html#SEC90">Chains of Implicit Rules</A>.
<P>
Implicit rules such as this one are written using the automatic variable
<SAMP>`$%'</SAMP>.  See section <A HREF="make_95.html#SEC94">Automatic Variables</A>.
<P>
An archive member name in an archive cannot contain a directory name, but
it may be useful in a makefile to pretend that it does.  If you write an
archive member target <TT>`foo.a(dir/file.o)'</TT>, <CODE>make</CODE> will perform
automatic updating with this command:
<P>
<PRE>
ar r foo.a dir/file.o
</PRE>
<P>
which has the effect of copying the file <TT>`dir/file.o'</TT> into a member
named <TT>`file.o'</TT>.  In connection with such usage, the automatic variables
<CODE>%D</CODE> and <CODE>%F</CODE> may be useful.
