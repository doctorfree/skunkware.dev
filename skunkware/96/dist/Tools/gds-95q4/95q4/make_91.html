<A NAME="IDX750"></A>
<A NAME="IDX751"></A>
<P>
Sometimes a file can be made by a sequence of implicit rules.  For example,
a file <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.o'</TT> could be made from <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.y'</TT> by running
first Yacc and then <CODE>cc</CODE>.  Such a sequence is called a <DFN>chain</DFN>.
<P>
If the file <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.c'</TT> exists, or is mentioned in the makefile, no
special searching is required: <CODE>make</CODE> finds that the object file can
be made by C compilation from <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.c'</TT>; later on, when considering
how to make <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.c'</TT>, the rule for running Yacc is
used.  Ultimately both <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.c'</TT> and <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.o'</TT> are
updated.<A NAME="IDX752"></A>
<A NAME="IDX753"></A>
<P>
However, even if <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.c'</TT> does not exist and is not mentioned,
<CODE>make</CODE> knows how to envision it as the missing link between
<TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.o'</TT> and <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.y'</TT>!  In this case, <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.c'</TT> is
called an <DFN>intermediate file</DFN>.  Once <CODE>make</CODE> has decided to use the
intermediate file, it is entered in the data base as if it had been
mentioned in the makefile, along with the implicit rule that says how to
create it.<P>
Intermediate files are remade using their rules just like all other
files.  The difference is that the intermediate file is deleted when
<CODE>make</CODE> is finished.  Therefore, the intermediate file which did not
exist before <CODE>make</CODE> also does not exist after <CODE>make</CODE>.  The
deletion is reported to you by printing a <SAMP>`rm -f'</SAMP> command that
shows what <CODE>make</CODE> is doing.  (You can list the target pattern of an
implicit rule (such as <SAMP>`%.o'</SAMP>) as a dependency of the special
target <CODE>.PRECIOUS</CODE> to preserve intermediate files made by implicit
rules whose target patterns match that file's name; 
see section <A HREF="make_48.html#SEC47">Interrupting or Killing <CODE>make</CODE></A>.)<A NAME="IDX755"></A>
<A NAME="IDX756"></A>
<A NAME="IDX757"></A>
<A NAME="IDX754"></A>
<P>
A chain can involve more than two implicit rules.  For example, it is
possible to make a file <TT>`foo'</TT> from <TT>`RCS/foo.y,v'</TT> by running RCS,
Yacc and <CODE>cc</CODE>.  Then both <TT>`foo.y'</TT> and <TT>`foo.c'</TT> are
intermediate files that are deleted at the end.<P>
No single implicit rule can appear more than once in a chain.  This means
that <CODE>make</CODE> will not even consider such a ridiculous thing as making
<TT>`foo'</TT> from <TT>`foo.o.o'</TT> by running the linker twice.  This
constraint has the added benefit of preventing any infinite loop in the
search for an implicit rule chain.
<P>
There are some special implicit rules to optimize certain cases that would
otherwise be handled by rule chains.  For example, making <TT>`foo'</TT> from
<TT>`foo.c'</TT> could be handled by compiling and linking with separate
chained rules, using <TT>`foo.o'</TT> as an intermediate file.  But what
actually happens is that a special rule for this case does the compilation
and linking with a single <CODE>cc</CODE> command.  The optimized rule is used in
preference to the step-by-step chain because it comes earlier in the
ordering of rules.
