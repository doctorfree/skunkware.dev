<P>
We use the phrase <DFN>source program</DFN>, abbreviated <DFN>source</DFN>, to
describe the program input to one run of <CODE>as</CODE>.  The program may
be in one or more files; how the source is partitioned into files
doesn't change the meaning of the source.
<P>
The source program is a concatenation of the text in all the files, in the
order specified.
<P>
Each time you run <CODE>as</CODE> it assembles exactly one source
program.  The source program is made up of one or more files.
(The standard input is also a file.)
<P>
You give <CODE>as</CODE> a command line that has zero or more input file
names.  The input files are read (from left file name to right).  A
command line argument (in any position) that has no special meaning
is taken to be an input file name.
<P>
If you give <CODE>as</CODE> no file names it attempts to read one input file
from the <CODE>as</CODE> standard input, which is normally your terminal.  You
may have to type <KBD>ctl-D</KBD> to tell <CODE>as</CODE> there is no more program
to assemble.
<P>
Use <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> if you need to explicitly name the standard input file
in your command line.
<P>
If the source is empty, <CODE>as</CODE> produces a small, empty object
file.

<P>
There are two ways of locating a line in the input file (or files) and
either may be used in reporting error messages.  One way refers to a line
number in a physical file; the other refers to a line number in a
"logical" file.  See section <A HREF="as_8.html#SEC8">Error and Warning Messages</A>.
<P>
<DFN>Physical files</DFN> are those files named in the command line given
to <CODE>as</CODE>.
<P>
<DFN>Logical files</DFN> are simply names declared explicitly by assembler
directives; they bear no relation to physical files.  Logical file names
help error messages reflect the original source file, when <CODE>as</CODE>
source is itself synthesized from other files.
See section <A HREF="as_67.html#SEC69"><CODE>.app-file <VAR>string</CODE></VAR></A>.
