<P>
The unified output format starts with a two-line header, which looks
like this:
<P>
<PRE>
--- <VAR>from-file</VAR> <VAR>from-file-modification-time</VAR>
+++ <VAR>to-file</VAR> <VAR>to-file-modification-time</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
You can change the header's content with the <SAMP>`-L <VAR>label</VAR>'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--label=<VAR>label</VAR>'</SAMP> option; see See section <A HREF="diff_26.html#SEC26">Showing Alternate File Names</A>.
<P>
Next come one or more hunks of differences; each hunk shows one area
where the files differ.  Unified format hunks look like this:
<P>
<PRE>
@@ <VAR>from-file-range</VAR> <VAR>to-file-range</VAR> @@
 <VAR>line-from-either-file</VAR>
 <VAR>line-from-either-file</VAR>...
</PRE>
<P>
The lines common to both files begin with a space character.  The lines
that actually differ between the two files have one of the following
indicator characters in the left column:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`+'</SAMP>
<DD>A line was added here to the first file.

<DT><SAMP>`-'</SAMP>
<DD>A line was removed here from the first file.
