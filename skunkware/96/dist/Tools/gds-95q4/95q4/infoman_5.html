<P>
Sometimes you are looking at a screenful of text, and only part of the
current paragraph you are reading is visible on the screen.  The
commands detailed in this section are used to shift which part of the
current node is visible on the screen.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>SPC</CODE> (<CODE>scroll-forward</CODE>)
<DD><A NAME="IDX42"></A>
<A NAME="IDX43"></A>
<A NAME="IDX44"></A>
<DT><CODE>C-v</CODE>
<DD>Shift the text in this window up.  That is, show more of the node which
is currently below the bottom of the window.  With a numeric argument,
show that many more lines at the bottom of the window; a numeric
argument of 4 would shift all of the text in the window up 4 lines
(discarding the top 4 lines), and show you four new lines at the bottom
of the window.  Without a numeric argument, <KBD>SPC</KBD> takes the bottom
two lines of the window and places them at the top of the window,
redisplaying almost a completely new screenful of lines.

<DT><CODE>DEL</CODE> (<CODE>scroll-backward</CODE>)
<DD><A NAME="IDX45"></A>
<A NAME="IDX46"></A>
<A NAME="IDX47"></A>
<DT><CODE>M-v</CODE>
<DD>Shift the text in this window down.  The inverse of
<CODE>scroll-forward</CODE>.

</DL>
<A NAME="IDX48"></A>
<P>
The <CODE>scroll-forward</CODE> and <CODE>scroll-backward</CODE> commands can also
move forward and backward through the node structure of the file.  If
you press <KBD>SPC</KBD> while viewing the end of a node, or <KBD>DEL</KBD> while
viewing the beginning of a node, what happens is controlled by the
variable <CODE>scroll-behaviour</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="infoman_17.html#SEC16">Manipulating Variables</A>, for more information.

<A NAME="IDX49"></A>
<A NAME="IDX50"></A>
<DT><CODE>C-l</CODE> (<CODE>redraw-display</CODE>)
<DD>Redraw the display from scratch, or shift the line containing the cursor
to a specified location.  With no numeric argument, <SAMP>`C-l'</SAMP> clears
the screen, and then redraws its entire contents.  Given a numeric
argument of <VAR>n</VAR>, the line containing the cursor is shifted so that
it is on the <VAR>n</VAR>th line of the window.

<A NAME="IDX51"></A>
<A NAME="IDX52"></A>
<DT><CODE>C-x w</CODE> (<CODE>toggle-wrap</CODE>)
<DD>Toggles the state of line wrapping in the current window.  Normally,
lines which are longer than the screen width <DFN>wrap</DFN>, i.e., they are
continued on the next line.  Lines which wrap have a <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> appearing
in the rightmost column of the screen.  You can cause such lines to be
terminated at the rightmost column by changing the state of line
wrapping in the window with <CODE>C-x w</CODE>.  When a line which needs more
space than one screen width to display is displayed, a <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> appears
in the rightmost column of the screen, and the remainder of the line is
invisible.
