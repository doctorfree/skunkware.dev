<P>
Now you can proceed just as for compiling a single-machine compiler
through the step of building stage 1.  If you have not provided some
sort of <TT>`libgcc1.a'</TT>, then compilation will give up at the point
where it needs that file, printing a suitable error message.  If you
do provide <TT>`libgcc1.a'</TT>, then building the compiler will automatically
compile and link a test program called <TT>`libgcc1-test'</TT>; if you get
errors in the linking, it means that not all of the necessary routines
in <TT>`libgcc1.a'</TT> are available.
<P>
You must provide the header file <TT>`float.h'</TT>.  One way to do this is
to compile <TT>`enquire'</TT> and run it on your target machine.  The job of
<TT>`enquire'</TT> is to run on the target machine and figure out by
experiment the nature of its floating point representation.
<TT>`enquire'</TT> records its findings in the header file <TT>`float.h'</TT>.
If you can't produce this file by running <TT>`enquire'</TT> on the target
machine, then you will need to come up with a suitable <TT>`float.h'</TT> in
some other way (or else, avoid using it in your programs).
<P>
Do not try to build stage 2 for a cross-compiler.  It doesn't work to
rebuild GNU CC as a cross-compiler using the cross-compiler, because
that would produce a program that runs on the target machine, not on the
host.  For example, if you compile a 386-to-68030 cross-compiler with
itself, the result will not be right either for the 386 (because it was
compiled into 68030 code) or for the 68030 (because it was configured
for a 386 as the host).  If you want to compile GNU CC into 68030 code,
whether you compile it on a 68030 or with a cross-compiler on a 386, you
must specify a 68030 as the host when you configure it.
<P>
To install the cross-compiler, use <SAMP>`make install'</SAMP>, as usual.
