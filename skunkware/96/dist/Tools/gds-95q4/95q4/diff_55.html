<P>
With <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP>, incomplete lines (see section <A HREF="diff_83.html#SEC83">Incomplete Lines</A>) are simply
copied to the output as they are found; if the merged output ends in an
conflict and one of the input files ends in an incomplete
line, succeeding <SAMP>`|||||||'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`======='</SAMP> or <SAMP>`&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;'</SAMP>
brackets appear somewhere other than the start of a line because
they are appended to the incomplete line.
<P>
Without <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP>, if an <CODE>ed</CODE> script option is specified and an
incomplete line is found, <CODE>diff3</CODE> generates a warning and acts as
if a newline had been present.
