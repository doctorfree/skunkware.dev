This directory contains SCO custom installable media images for use
on SCO OpenServer 5 and/or SCO Internet FastStart systems.

The individual media images are cpio archives named VOL* 

This directory also contains a tar archive of the media images placed
here for ease of downloading.

To install from these media images, download the tar archive (*.tar),
extract into an empty directory, and use the SCO custom utility (/etc/custom)
to install a New product from media images. When prompted for the location
of the media images, enter the full pathname of the extraction directory.
