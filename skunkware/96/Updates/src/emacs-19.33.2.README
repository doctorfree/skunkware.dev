This distribution installs on 5.0.x systems by doing an:

	#  make install

If you have troubles with fonts in X, you will need to 
add the following lines to your local or system-wide
.Xdefaults file:

Emacs*Background:	white
Emacs*Font:	-*-courier-medium-r-*-*-*-120-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1
Emacs*Foreground:	black


This will set the correct font and color resources.
