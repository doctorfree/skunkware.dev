NcFTPN Version 2.3.0 - Fast and friendly ftp program



This is NcFTP version 2.3.0 as built for SCO Skunkware '96.
NcFTP is a user interface to the Internet standard File Transfer
Protocol. This program allows a user to transfer files to and from
a remote network site, and offers additional features that are not
found in the standard interface, ftp.

NcFTP has options like redialing a busy remote site, using
colon-mode, using a recent-sites file and much more. Please
refer to the NcFTP man page for further features.


This package was built by Joachim Reith of SCO, (joachimr@sco.com),
for inclusion in the SCO Skunkware '96 CD-ROM.


The SCO Skunkware NcFTP 2.3.0 consists of following archives:

   1. src/ncftp.tar.gz is the source code without any modifications.
	The home FTP site is on	ftp://ftp.probe.net/pub/ncftp/.
	It builds straight with cc and gcc without any problems.

   2. inst/ncftp_build.tar.gz contains following files

	./usr/local/bin/ncftp
	./usr/local/man/man1/ncftp.1


	The package can be copied in the root directory and
	installed by running:

             cd /
	     gzcat ncftp_build.tar.gz | tar xvf -


   3. The build package is compiled with following modifications
	because I'm working with localised systems and NcFTP
	doesn't display characters like umlaute in the right way:

	$ diff Main.c Main.bak
	11d10
	< #include <locale.h>
	870d868
	<       setlocale ( LC_CTYPE, "" );

	I have added also the option "-belf" to LDFLAGS in Makefile.
