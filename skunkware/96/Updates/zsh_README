Z shell version 3.0.0 - August 1996



This is Z shell version 3.0.0 as built for SCO Skunkware '96. 
Zsh is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is
also for powerful scripting language. Many of the useful features
of bash, ksh, and tcsh were incorporated into zsh; many
original features were added.


This package was built by Joachim Reith of SCO, (joachimr@sco.com),
for inclusion in the SCO Skunkware '96 CD-ROM.


The SCO Skunkware 96 Z shell 3.0.0 consists of following archives:

   1. src/zsh.tar.gz is the source code without any modifications. It is
	also available from the canonical FTP site on
	ftp://ftp.cs.elte.hu/pub/zsh/. It builds straight with cc and gcc
	without any problems.

   2. inst/zsh_build.tar.gz contains following files

	./usr/lib/mkuser/zsh/zshrc
	./usr/lib/mkuser/zsh/zlogin
	./usr/lib/mkuser/zsh/mkuser.defs
	./usr/lib/mkuser/zsh/zshenv
	./usr/lib/mkuser/zsh/zcompctl
	./usr/lib/mkuser/zsh/mkuser.init
	./usr/local/bin/zsh
	./usr/local/man/man1/zsh.1
	./usr/local/man/man1/zshbuiltins.1
	./usr/local/man/man1/zshcompctl.1
	./usr/local/man/man1/zshexpn.1
	./usr/local/man/man1/zshmisc.1
	./usr/local/man/man1/zshoptions.1
	./usr/local/man/man1/zshparam.1
	./usr/local/man/man1/zshzle.1
	./usr/local/man/man1/zshall.1

	The package can be copied in the root directory by running:

             cd /
	     gzcat zsh_build.tar.gz | tar xvf -

	In this way Z shell can be installed with the Account Manager
	from SCOadmin.


   3. I have build the package with following modifications:

	LIBS     =  -lcurses
	LDFLAGS  = -belf
