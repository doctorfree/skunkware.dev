README.UW for UnixWare port of JOL.  JOL is a mod player.
See README for original information.

This program was taken from the Linux archives.  Ported (minimal required)
to UnixWare.

The included binary was compiled on a 386 UnixWare 2.02 machine with
VoxWare 2.9 driver installed.

To rebuild, you need GCC 2.5.8 or better, VoxWare 2.9, and GNU make.
