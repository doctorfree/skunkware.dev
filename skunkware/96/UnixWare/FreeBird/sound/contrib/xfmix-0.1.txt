This was taken from the Linux archive.  It is a Audio Mixer application.
It requires the following:

1) VoxWare 2.9+
2) XForms
3) Xwindows

I have included a dynamicly linked bin!  You must get the XForms package
in order to run this - see Readme.XFORMS in the distribution.  I have
included all origional documentation from the author.
