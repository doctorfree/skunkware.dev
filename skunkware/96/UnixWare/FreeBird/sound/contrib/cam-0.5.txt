README.UW for UnixWare port of CAM.  CAM is a sound mixer.
See README for original information.

This program was taken from the Linux archives.  Ported to UnixWare.

The included binary was compiled on a 386 UnixWare 2.02 machine with
VoxWare 2.9 driver installed.

To rebuild you need VoxWare 2.9.
