This file is a gzip'ed tar archive of a PC speaker driver.  This
driver enables you to send some nifty sounds out through the
standard PC speaker.

I have only tested this on a 386DX40 PC running UnixWare 2.02. It
should work on any PC with standard speaker HW running UnixWare.
I believe that it should work on UnixWare 1.x - but I cannot test
this.  If you try to install on UnixWare 1.x you should do a make
clean since the Driver.o that is in the archive was built on my
machine.

See the README's in the archive.
