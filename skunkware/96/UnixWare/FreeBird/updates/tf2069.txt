Installation Instructions:  

DATATYPE: tar

1.To use this ptf, you must have a working UnixWare machine.

2.Expand the tf2069.tar file into the /tmp directory using the following commands from a terminal window or the UNIX command line:

	# cd /tmp
	# tar xvf /tmp/tf2069.tar

PTF2069 - Installation Fixes

Novell Product And Version
--------------------------

UnixWare 2.01

Abstract
--------

This PTF fixes several problems that occur on some computers during the
installation of UnixWare 2.01.

Symptoms
--------

1) The system always enables the cache and does not allow the user to override
that cache enabling.  Some computers (especially prototypes) must have the
cache disabled in order to install and run.

2) On some computers whose secondary cache and/or memory does not support
parity checking, the system panics with a Machine Check Exception just after
the initial red logo screen disappears.

3) The system does not automatically recognize the presence of LBA IDE disks.

4) Certain computers contain a faulty BIOS that causes PCI devices to
respond incorrectly, making it appear to the system that there are more
PCI devices than there really are.  This will cause various problems,
including installation failures or the inability to access the hard disk
during a reboot.

5) The BIOS of some EISA computers writes past the end of a buffer, which
causes a PANIC just after the red Novell logo screen disappears.

SOLUTION SPECIFICS
------------------

General Description.
-------------------

This PTF contains fixes for the problems listed above, and is intended to be
used only if you cannot otherwise install UnixWare 2.01. In general, if you have
already installed UnixWare 2.01, then you do not need this PTF.

New Features.
------------

None.

Software Notes and Recommendations.
----------------------------------

This PTF is designed for use only with the UnixWare 2.01 installation media
(that is, UnixWare 2.01 on tape or CD, or in the staging area of a network
install server).  Do not attempt to use this PTF with UnixWare 2.0 or with
UnixWare 2.02 or beyond.

Testing of the modified software contained in this package has been
conducted only to the extent necessary to confirm that it resolves the
problem(s) stated above ("Symptom").  Such testing consists of
recreating the problem conditions (typically in a Novell test
laboratory) and verifying that the problem no longer occurs.  No other
testing of this software has been done.

Hardware Notes and Recommendations.
----------------------------------

This PTF is targeted for the i386, i486 and Pentium CPU's.

Installation Instructions.
-------------------------
                ***** Making the PTF Diskettes *****

Follow this procedure to write the images from this PTF onto diskettes.  You
will then use these diskettes to install UnixWare 2.01.

1)  Format two 3.5-inch diskettes.  To format the first diskette,
place a blank diskette into a diskette drive and enter

	/usr/sbin/format -i 1 device_name

where device_name is /dev/rdsk/f03ht if your 3.5-inch drive is A, or
/dev/rdsk/f13ht if your 3.5-inch drive is B.

To format the second diskette, place a blank diskette into a diskette drive
and enter

	/usr/sbin/format -i 2 device_name

where device_name is as above.  Note that the two "format" lines above are
identical except for the argument to the -i option.

Put a paper label on each diskette, and write "ptf 2069 Boot Diskette" on the
first diskette, and "ptf 2069 Patch Diskette" on the second.

2)  Copy the appropriate Boot diskette image onto the first diskette.  To do
this, enter

	/usr/bin/dd if=image_file of=device_name bs=36b

where image_file is ptf2069.dd.as (if you bought the Application Server) or
ptf2069.dd.pe (if you bought the Personal Edition), and device_name is as
described above.

	Note:  If you bought the Personal Edition and you try using
	ptf2069.dd.as, the installation will likely hang, and even if it does
	not hang you will still have only a two-user license.  The licensing
	data are not contained in ptf2069.dd.as or in ptf2069.dd.pe.  By the
	way, the reverse is also true -- if you bought the Application Server
	and you try using ptf2069.dd.pe, installation will likely hang.

3)  Copy the Patch diskette image onto the second diskette.  To do this, enter

	/usr/bin/dd if=ptf2069 of=device_name bs=36b

where device_name is as described above.


                ***** Installing the PTF Diskettes *****

If you are installing this PTF because you need to disable the cache (item 1
under "Symptoms"), then do the following:
	1)  Boot from the diskette labeled "ptf 2069 Boot Diskette"
	2)  As soon as you see the message "Booting UnixWare...", press the
		space bar
	3)  Type "CR0_CACHE_ENABLE=NO"
	4)  Type "go"

If you are installing this PTF because your system gets the Machine Check
Exception panic (item 2 under "Symptoms"), then do the following:
	1)  Boot from the diskette labeled "ptf 2069 Boot Diskette"
	2)  As soon as you see the message "Booting UnixWare...", press the
		space bar
	3)  Type "CR4_MCE=NO"
	4)  Type "go"

If you are installing this PTF for any of the other reasons listed under
"Symptoms", just boot from the diskette labeled "ptf 2069 Boot Diskette".  You
do not need to hit the space bar.

After you boot from the "ptf 2069 Boot Diskette," the installation of UnixWare
2.01 will proceed as documented in the "Installation Handbook."  Toward the
end of installation, you will be prompted to insert the "ptf 2069 Patch
Diskette."  Follow the directions you see on the screen at that point.
	
After installation is complete, you will see a blue screen that says

	Final activation of the UnixWare 2 software requires the installation
	of selected software.  This software is contained on the Install
	diskette that came with your system.

At this point, you need to insert the original UnixWare 2.01 Install diskette
that came with your system.  Do not insert the "ptf 2069 Boot Diskette," for
it will not work.

If you installed the "OS Multiprocessor Support" (osmp) package during the
initial installation, you will need to bring the second processor on-line
manually.  Type 

	/sbin/psradm -n -a

You will need to do this only once;  that is, you do not need to repeat it
after subsequent reboots of the system.

	Note:  If you have more than two processors you wish to bring on-line,
	you will need to purchase and install one or more copies of the
	"Processor Upgrade" package.

If you install ptf2069, and you later install the "OS Multiprocessor Support"
(osmp) package, you will need to run "/usr/sbin/pkgrm ptf2069" and then
reinstall ptf2069 using /usr/sbin/pkgadd.  After installing osmp, you
*must not* reboot the system until after you remove and reinstall ptf2069.

If you do reboot after installing osmp and before reinstalling ptf2069, the
system will most likely panic or hang while it is booting.  If this happens,
turn the computer off and back on.  When you see the message
	Booting UnixWare...
*immediately* press the space bar to enter interactive boot mode, then type
	KERNEL=unix.old
	go
When the system comes up, the first thing you should do is remove and
reinstall ptf2069 and then reboot using the /usr/sbin/shutdown command.

Some customers might need to install this PTF after UnixWare 2.01 is already up
and running.  (This will be rare.  Such customers would usually be hardware
vendors who need to disable the cache to test some new hardware.)  If this is
true for you, insert the diskette labelled "ptf 2069 Patch Diskette," type
	/usr/sbin/pkgadd -d diskette1
and follow the instructions you see.  You will not need to use the "ptf 2069
Boot Diskette" at all.
