	Overview Posting of the UnixWare Freebird archive
	--------------------------------------------------

This is an overview posting describing the contents of the UnixWare
Freebird archive available on the internet (formerly the novell.co.uk
usle archive).

This archive contains ports of freely available software to UnixWare
in source and binary form. The mission of this archive is to provide
quality ported code to the UnixWare operating system and to make that
freely available.

Disclaimer: The Freebird archive is not officially supported by
SCO or Novell but is a volunteer effort started by former USL staff, now
supported by volunteers on the Internet (email freebird-admin@abs.net).

Contributions to this archive are welcome from all, and have been 
received from worldwide.  To contribute to the archive, we need binaries ,
sources and a README describing copyright status and install instructions
(note the binaries should install in /opt/ or /usr/local) , place
these in one of the primary ftp sites /incoming  directories
and send email to freebird-admin@abs.net.

This archive is freely available to anyone who has email or 
internet accessibility.

The rest of this article describes the archive and its contents.

What's Available?
----------------

This archive mostly contains pre-ported and packaged up UnixWare
binaries (and sources).  Just request the files, read the README and
pkgadd the package.

The following file naming conventions are used in the archive to
denote the file type:

	xxxx.pkg.tar.Z     A compressed tar archive of a binary in
			   pkgadd format
	xxxx.src.tar.Z     A compressed tar archive of source code

	xxxx.bin.tar.Z	   A compressed tar archive containing binaries
			   in normal filesystem format (not in pkgadd)

Where a file is suffixed with .gz this means that the GNU Zip
file compression utility has been used.

The ".pkg" software package files follow the ABI (System V Application
Binary Interface) conventions for add-on
packages and are installed in /opt. It is wise to
change the default PATH setting to include /opt/bin in /etc/profile.

	PATH=$PATH:/opt/bin
	export PATH

If you do not have a /opt, you can create it with the subdirectories
/opt/bin, /opt/lib, /opt/man -- you could also use a symbolic link
to some other part of disk if you like (for example /usr/local) which
can be useful if you get short of free disk space.

To make the manual pages accessible to the /usr/ucb/man command
set the MANPATH environment variable to include /opt/man,
a typical MANPATH might be:

        MANPATH=/usr/share/man:/opt/man
        export MANPATH
                          
The packages (pkg.tar files) should be installed as follows:

1. Extract the tar archive into /tmp.

$ cd /tmp

If compressed (.Z) then

$ zcat package.tar|tar xvf -
$ su
# pkgadd -d `pwd`

Many of the utilities include desktop icons for point and click
operation:

2. Installing graphically

On UnixWare 1.x:
----------------
To install graphically on UnixWare (after you have installed the package)
        Select the System_Setup icon from the Desktop.
        Select Application_Setup from System_Setup
        Wait while the system catalogs the applications
        Select the package icon from Application_Setup to get to
            Application_Setup:package_name         
       Select the package icon and Finally click on the Install_to_desktop
        Selecting Applications from the Desktop you should
        then see the package icon.
                    
On UnixWare 2.x:

For UnixWare 2.0 and later, use the App_Installer utility in Admin_Tools
after doing the pkgadd.

	Select the Admin_Tools icon from the Desktop.
	Select the App_Installer icon from Admin_Tools
	Select the icon of the package from the "All Applications
		currently installed" window
	Select Show_Contents
	Select the installable icon and hit Copy_to_folder
	Select Apply, followed by Ok.
