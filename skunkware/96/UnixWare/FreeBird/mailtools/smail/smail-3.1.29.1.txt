This software contributed to the archive "as is"

--------------

This is Smail-3.1.29.1 with the ESMTP support patches applied.  This 
software should compile on both UnixWare 1.1.x and UnixWare 2.x without
any trouble.  I have even supplied generic binaries for UnixWare 2.x
systems.  The binaries were compiled under UnixWare 2.01 using full
optimization.

Currently the files are just in a plain cpio archive (see the file
smail-3.1.29.1.cpio.gz) and have been compressed with GNU Gzip 1.2.4.
I would like to place then in an pkginstall format, but haven't had 
the time to do this, nor will I for at least several weeks.  In hopes
of helping some of the users that are having a terrible time with
the SMTP services under UnixWare 2.x, I am releasing the code as is.

Our site is connected via SMTP, and is also serving UUCP system, and
it runs flawless on my system.  So have at it, and be sure to take a 
look at the README.* files for full details...


                                     Enjoy,
