XROACH(1)                USER COMMANDS                  XROACH(1)



NAME
     xroach - cockroaches hide under your windows

SYNOPSIS
     xroach [-option .,..]

DESCRIPTION
     Xroach displays disgusting cockroaches on your root  window.
     These  creapy crawlies scamper around until they find a win-
     dow to hide under. Whenever you move or  iconify  a  window,
     the exposed orthopteras again scamper for cover.

OPTIONS
     -display display_name
             Drop the roaches on the given display. Make sure the
             display is nearby, so you can hear the screams.  


     -rc roach_color
             Use the given string  as  the  color  for  the  bugs
             instead of the default "black".

     -speed roach_speed
             Use the given speed for the insects instead  of  the
             default  20.0.  For  example,  in  winter  the speed
             should be set to 5.0. In summer, 30.0 might be about
             right.

     -roaches num_roaches
             This is the number of the little  critters.  Default
             is 10.

     -squish Enables roach squishing.  Point and shoot  with  any
             mouse button.

     -rgc roach_gut_color
             Sets color of the guts that spill  out  of  squished
             roaches.  We recommend yellowgreen.
