README for the gcc-2.7.2 and libg++-2.7.1 pkg for svr4.2

I've uploaded my working gcc-2.7.2 / libg++-2.7.1 set to ftp.novell.de. The
pkg's are gzip'ed tar-files of pkgadd(1) trees. The gcc-2.7.2 is splitted
into 6 parts for easy ftp transfer (the whole file is around 6MB).
After ftp-get you've to re-create the gcc-2.7.2 tar file with the following
cmd:

	# cat gcc-x86-*PART? > gcc-x86-svr4.2-v2.7.2-pkg.tar.gz

The sum(1) values for the libg++-2.7.1 pkg, the gcc-2.7.2 pkg and for
the files gcc-x86-*PART? are:

 8043  2048  gcc-x86-svr4.2-v2.7.2-pkg.tar.gz-PART1
44542  2048  gcc-x86-svr4.2-v2.7.2-pkg.tar.gz-PART2
54181  2048  gcc-x86-svr4.2-v2.7.2-pkg.tar.gz-PART3
21653  2048  gcc-x86-svr4.2-v2.7.2-pkg.tar.gz-PART4
49015  2048  gcc-x86-svr4.2-v2.7.2-pkg.tar.gz-PART5
56555   860  gcc-x86-svr4.2-v2.7.2-pkg.tar.gz-PART6
37384 11100  gcc-x86-svr4.2-v2.7.2-pkg.tar.gz
47244  1403  libg++-x86-svr4.2-v2.7.1-pkg.tar.gz

The software was compiled under Onsite Unix SVR4.2 with the cc(1) and
should also run under UnixWare 1.x and 2.0x and other x86 based SVR4.x
systems. Please let me know if there are any problems.

To install the pkg's just copy them to /tmp and type as root:

	# cd /tmp
        # gzip -d gcc-x86-svr4.2-v2.7.2-pkg.tar
	# gzip -d libg++-x86-svr4.2-v2.7.1-pkg.tar
	# tar xf  gcc-x86-svr4.2-v2.7.2-pkg.tar
 	# tar xf  libg++-x86-svr4.2-v2.7.1-pkg.tar
	# pkgadd -d `pwd`

          The following packages are available:
            1  gcc        GNU C compiler
                          (i486) 2.7.2
            2  libg++     GNU libg++ library
                          (i486) 2.7.1

          Select package(s) you wish to process (or 'all' to process
          all packages). (default: all) [?,??,q]:


Type 'all' to install both pkg's; this will install the software
below /usr/local/
