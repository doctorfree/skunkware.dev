Below is a short explanation of the features included in the UnixWare 2.0
IHVKIT package, which is currently distributed with the UnixWare 2.0 SDK.

=============================================================================
The Novell UnixWare Independent Hardware Vendor (IHV) Development Kit is
designed to help vendors write and package their own UnixWare device drivers.

The UnixWare 2.0 IHV Development Kit v2.0 consists of both documentation, as
well as a UnixWare package, containing code examples, utilities, and help
files.

1) Paper Documentation
	1) Device Driver Programming
		A comprehensive guide on how to write, configure, and package
		device drivers.
	2) Portable Device Interface (PDI)
		A programming guide on writing device drivers to use the
		Portable Device Interface (PDI), a framework that is designed
		to organize, simplify, and standardize the way device drivers
		operate.
	3) Streams Modules and Drivers
		A programming guide on writing STREAMS drivers.
	4) Device Driver Reference
		Previously known as the DDI/DKI, this reference manual
		documents all the routines and structures that make up the
		Device Driver Interface/Driver-Kernel Interface, as well as
		the routines and structures specific to PDI and STREAMS.

2) Code Examples/Utilities/Help Files

	Broken into 3 major directories:

	1) Video Display device drivers
		2 sample subdirectories

		1) Intel Linear Frame Buffer (LFB) 1.0 Display Modules and
			Vendor Modules for the ATI(R) Ultra Pro and the
			Dell(R) Jaws adapters.

		2) Using the existing libvga256.so.2 to create support for a
			new video card (Cirrus GD54XX-based).

	2) Network device drivers
		A sample ethernet (dlpi - el16) driver for UW 1.1

	3) Portable Device Interface (PDI) drivers
		Sectioned into 7 subdirectories:

		1) DPT SCSI HBA driver example for both UW 1.1 and UW 2.0
			Compatible with:
				EISA DPT-2012A, DPT-2012B, DPT-2012B2, DPT-2022
					DPT-2122, DPT-2322, DPT-EISA
				PCI DPT-PCI
				ISA DPT-2011, DPT-2021
		2) Non-SCSI tape driver example for both UW 1.1 and UW 2.0
			Compatible with:
				MCA ARCHIVE
				ISA ARCHIVE, WANGTEK 31040-XXX,
					WANGTEK 30428-XXX, WANGTEK 30475-XXX
					WANGTEK 30631-XXX
		3) Non-SCSI CR-ROM driver example for both UW1.1 and UW 2.0
			Compatible with:
				ISA Mitsumi CRMC CD-ROM
		4) DDI Tools
			Contains the ddicheck program, which checks drivers
			for ddi/dki/sdi conformance problems using a lint
			library that contains all symbols in the ddi/dki/sdi.
			It's best at finding symbols that are used, but are
			not part of the ddi interface.
		5) HBA Guidelines
			This directory contains a set of guidelines that are
			mandatory reading for every vendor who plans to
			develop, test, and support storage device drivers.
		6) HBA Debugging
			Contains instructions/binary images for invoking kdb
			during system bootup when drivers are dynamically
			loaded from the IHV-HBA floppies.
		7) IHV HBA floppy generation
			Contains tools/readme files which explain how to
			generate an IHV HBA floppy, as well as providing a
			UW 2.0 example.
