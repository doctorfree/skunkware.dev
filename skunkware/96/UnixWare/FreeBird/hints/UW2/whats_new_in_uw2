     *    Enhanced hardware support
     *    Enhanced network support 
     *    Enhanced Novell NetWare support
     *    Enhanced development environment 

1) Symmetrical Multi-processor (SMP) support.

     *    UnixWare 2 now supports and runs on server with more the 1 CPU.
     *    Special development tools to enable applications to be written to exploit the
          power and performance available with the MP architecture.

2) Easier installation and autodetection of hardware components 

     *    Majority of questions asked up-front.
     *    Greatly expanded hardware driver support.

3) Motif Graphical User Interface (GUI) now included as standard.

4) Graphically configurable Video drivers and options 

5) Access control lists, allows for enhanced security and down to file and user level.

6) Built-in 'C' language compiler 

7) Enhanced and greatly improved Desktop 

     *    Allows easy migration from MS-Windows or other UNIX systems

8) Improved Networking

     *    Support for multiple network interface cards (LAN cards)
     *    TCP/IP Routing
     *    Support for NIS (Network Information Service) protocol, both client & server
     *    TCP/IP protocols bundled and enhanced to increase performance
     *    Network Installation over TCP/IP and IPX (IPX no longer requires NetWare
          server to be present)
     *    All TCP/IP parameters configured into installation
     *    BOOTP support
     *    Graphical TCP/IP setup greatly easing administration

9) Improved NetWare integration

     *    Fully multi-threaded, 32bit IPX support
     *    IPX routing
     *    SPX II support
     *    Development support over IPX with NetWare API
     *    NetWare UNIX client software to allow UnixWare seamless access to
          NetWare files
     *    Bi-Directional printing between NetWare and UnixWare
     *    DOS & MS-Windows based terminal emulation to allow access to UnixWare
          applications over IPX.
     *    Support for SNMP over TCP/IP & IPX (Auto-discovered by
          NMS/Managewise)
     *    Storage Management Services (SMS) allows single point backup of both
          NetWare and UnixWare servers.
     *    Auto-login and auto-authentication from UnixWare 2 desktop to all NetWare
          servers
     *    NetWare Service Advertising Protocol (SAP 2), makes UnixWare 2
          independent of  NetWare for IPX network addressing enabling installation
          and login over IPX.

10)New and improved Desktop tools.

     *    New GUI tool for configuring high resolution display adapters and settings.
          Video adapters are autodetected.
     *    New Device Configuration Utility (DCU) allows you to change hardware
          setting for adapter cards etc..
     *    New GUI based E-mail admin utility for configuring MHS and SMTP mail
          gateways
     *    Improved GUI easy and simple printer setup local or remote UNIX and
          NetWare printers.
     *    New GUI processor setup allows administrators to check status of CPU's.
     *    New GUI system monitor application that provides real-time graphed
          statistic's on system utilisation, (CPU, user and many, many others). Allows
          administrators to quickly identify and isolate system and performance
          problems.
     *    Graphical system tuner lets administrators  adjust system parameters and
          variables and allows administrators to quickly and easily fine tune and
          optimize UnixWare
     *    New features provides a walk through of downloading and installing a
          World-Wide-Web server (WWW).
     *    New icon editor allows users to create their own icons.
     *    Simplified and enhanced E-mail application allow creation of distribution
          lists.
     *    'DynaText' online help system provide complete online documentation set.
          Same as NetWare, provides easy browsing/searching and printing.
     *    New 'Message monitor' display all system messages in a window.
     *    New remote login icon allow desktop users easy access to remote
          UnixWare as well as other UNIX systems.
