Problem: mwm does not highlight the input window like olwm

Solution: Add the following to the .Xdefaults-hostname file
(hostname should be replaced by the name of the machine)

Mwm*activeBackground:   white

Note that the color white can be substituted with your favourite
color Sometimes, it helps to specify both the foreground and background
colors, as in:

Mwm*activeBackground:   #7FFF7FFF7FFF
Mwm*activeForeground:   #FFFFFFFFFFFF


Problem: mwm locates the icons at the bottom left of the screen
but i would prefer to move them elsewhere...

Solution: Add the following to the .Xdefaults-hostname file
(hostname should be replaced by the name of the machine)

Mwm*iconPlacement:  top right



Problem: many of the dtm icons get clipped.

Mwm*iconImageMaximum:	64x64

Problem: my favorite app's icon is missing in action, for example,
Mosaic.

Mwm*Mosaic*iconImage:	/usr/X/lib/bitmaps/xmosaic.xbm

Note:  your milage may vary depending on what you've got hanging
around on your system.

Problem: some keys don't get passed through to DOS; mwm is
eating them up!

Mwm*dos*passHelp:	True
Mwm*dos*passKeys:	True
