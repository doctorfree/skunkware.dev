Example Class Databases
-----------------------

Here are some pxample class databases we have collected here.  The control
how applications work and what icons to use.

For example, a lotus 123 class database will show lotus itself as a "123"
icon, *.wk1 as a 2D spreadsheet icon and *.wk3 as a 3D speadsheet icon.  Also,
double clicking the 123 icon will run 123.  Double clicking on a speardsheet
icon will run 123 and then load that speadsheet.  Dragging any file on top of
the 123 icon will run lotus and then load that file.  A pop-up menu for
the lotus icon is also provided.

To use these class databases the easest way to to tack them onto your own
$HOME/.dtfclass file.  However, if you are developing a package it is
better to create a seperate file (in /usr/X/lib/classdb) which will then
get included into the users .dtfclass file when the package is installed.
(see the development notes for more information)

The classdb and pixmaps directory was created by Rick Richardson (I took it
from the net-news).
