Here are my local UnixWare desktop rules files (classdb) and pixmaps
(icons), for many games, PD apps, and sound and picture files.  I
personally find the desktop manager's System_Setup/Icon_Setup GUI
interface to be an incomplete substitute for writing classdb files.

Note that I have also put a huge archive of over 3500 icons in XPM1
format (the format UW uses) on:

	ftp.x.org:/contrib/hobbes-icons-xpm1.tar.gz

If you need more icons - get this file!

What in here is:
	classdb/*.cdb			- rules files
	pixmaps/*			- associated icons
	classdb/README			- this file
	classdb/make_desktop_links	- script to make symlinks

I personally keep this stuff segregated in a parallel directory
tree (w.r.t. /usr/X) rooted at /usr/local/X.  Unpack this
tree in that directory (if you don't, you will need to
edit all of the rules files in classdb).  Then add:

	INCLUDE /usr/local/X/lib/classdb/local.cdb;

to the end of file /usr/X/lib/classdb/dtadmin.

Then, stop and restart your desktop manager.  The rules
files will now be in effect.

All that's left is to make the symlinks for the programs.
You can do this easily with the following steps:

	cd /usr/local/X/lib/classdb
	./make_desktop_links *.cdb

make_desktop_links is a script that wades thru the .cdb (classdb)
files and figures out what links to make, and where.  The
"where" part is handled by a special #SYMLINK comment
convention that I use in my .cdb files.

Note that real applications normally come with classdb rules
files, pixmaps, and icon definition files that can be
installed by using the normal desktop GUI interface
under System_Setup/Appl-n_Setup.  This procedure is
what I use for stuff I've added to my own system that
doesn't have such niceties.
