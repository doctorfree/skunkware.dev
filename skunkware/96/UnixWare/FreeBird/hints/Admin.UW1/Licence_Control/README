Licence Control
---------------

With a large network of SVR4.2/UnxWare machines it becomes very difficult to
keep track of what software is installed on what machine.  How can you
tell if you are sticking to your licence agreements or not.

I've developed this set of scripts which help control this situation.  It isn't
bullet proof by a long way but it does help to bring the situation under
control.


There is a two-pronged protection scheme :-

Firstly, all machines are scanned over night to check what is installed.  If
any errors are detected the system manager gets an email.

Secondly, when an application is run, there is a check to see how many other 
version of the same application are already running.  If too many are in
use then the application fails to start.


The scripts are controlled by one configuration file "max_install" which
lists what licences you own (some are unlimited use such as PD packages).

How to install these scripts
----------------------------

You will have to un-tar the scripts as usual and have to edit some hard-coded
paths in check_killed_apps and start_app.

Edit max_install script to reflect your licences.

Install a root cron job to run check_machine every day.

Install a root cron job to run check_killed_apps every day.

On each workstation run install_mini_licence - this will adjust that machines'
class databases to ensure that the licenced applications are started using
start_app.

These scripts were written for our use - you will no doubt find some instances
where they are specific to our needs rather than yours.  Please email me with
any suggested changes (plord@uel.co.uk).
