After installing SVR4.2/UnixWare you may find that you havn't enough swap space.

A typical symptom is new processes not starting.

To check you setup you need to know the amount of RAM your machine has plus
the amount of swap space currently installed.

Use the "memsize" command to find out your RAM size and "swap -l" to see
your swap space.  For example, on my machine :-

# memsize
16384000

# swap -l
path                                dev  swaplo blocks   free
/dev/swap                          47,2       0  34848  12512

Showing I have 16Mb of RAM plus 34846 blocks of swap (17Mb) (34846 / 2 = 17424).

It is nice to have twice the amount of swap space as RAM, although for a desktop
machine 1 1/2 times should be enough.

In my case, I decide to add another 8Mb of swap.  However, I don't want to
re-install the whole machine!

It is possible to have a swap file rather than a swap partition (although a
file is less efficient).  In fact, you can have a swap partition and a swap
file in use at the same time.

To add an 8Mb swap file do :-

	ulimit 99999
	dd if=/dev/zero count=8 bs=1000k of=/swapfile
	swap -a /swapfile

Now the swap -l command reports :-

# swap -l
path                                dev  swaplo blocks   free
/dev/swap                          47,2       0  34848  12512
/usr/swapfile                      47,20      0  16000  11784


One problem is that the swap -a command needs to be run on ever boot.  Install
this script in /etc/rc2.d/S80swap :-

case "$1" in
'start')
        /etc/swap -a /swapfile
        ;;
'stop')
        ;;
esac


Note that the swap file can exist on any partition large enough to contain it.
