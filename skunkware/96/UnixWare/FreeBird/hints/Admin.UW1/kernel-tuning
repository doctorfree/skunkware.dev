	How to tune various kernel resource limits


	The following resource limits can be tuned.

		To increase file limit size (equivalent to
		ulimit):

			SFSZLIM - Soft file size limit.
			HFSZLIM - Hard file size limit.

		To increase user data (process heap and
		brk(2)) area:

			SDATLIM - Soft data limit.
			HDATLIM - Hard data limit.

		To increase user stack (stack segment) area:

			SSTKLIM - Soft stack limit.
			HSTKLIM - Hard stack limit.

		To increase address space (brk(2) area) for
		process:

			SVMMLIM - Soft Virtual Memory limit.
			HVMMLIM - Hard Virtual Memory limit.

The procedure to change these tunable parameters is documented
in the UnixWare System Administration - System Performance
Administration manual, Chapter 3.  To change these parameters,
login or su to root and:

	# cd /etc/conf/bin

	# ./idtune SFSZLIM 0x7FFFFFFF

Change all the parameters that affect you.  The idtune command
changes SFSZLIM to the unlimited setting.  You also may specify
a lower value than this if you do not want it set to unlimited.  
You can also see each tunable parameter's current setting by
doing the following (using SFSZLIM for example):

	# ./idtune -g SFSZLIM
	0x1000000       0x1000000       0x2000  0x7FFFFFFF

The first value is the current setting, the second is the
default setting, the third is the minimum value, and the last is
the maximum value.

After all tunable paramters have been changed, you need to
rebuild the kernel and shutdown the system:

	# ./idbuild -B

	# cd / ; shutdown -g0 -y
