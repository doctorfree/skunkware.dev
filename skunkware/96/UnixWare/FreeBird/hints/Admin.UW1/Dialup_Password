Q. How do I set a dialup password on UnixWare for a specific port?

A.Two files must be created in the /etc directory, and for ease of
use you can add a user (say called dialup).

(1) /etc/d_passwd
------------------

This is the dialup password file.

# ls -l /etc/d_passwd
-rw-------   1 root     root          70 May 13 07:44 /etc/d_passwd
#

This contains entries for login shells (uucico,ksh and sh).
Usually there is no additional password for uucico.
Interactive logins (ksh, and sh) have passwords.

The encrypted password must be put in the file, note spaces and position
of the colon delimiters are critical.

# cat /etc/d_passwd
/usr/lib/uucp/uucico::
/usr/bin/ksh:66NOJGfJw4I.A:
/usr/bin/sh:66NOJGfJw4I.A:
#

(2) /etc/dialups
-----------------
The second file /etc/dialups dictates which devices are
to have the dialup password prompt

# cat /etc/dialups
/dev/tty00
/dev/tty01h


(3) Setting the password
------------------------
To set the password, I have a login entry for a user dialup (this 
just executes date as the login shell).

Thus on the day to change the password

i)

# passwd dialup
New password:
Re-enter new password:
#

ii)

# grep dialup /etc/shadow|cut -f2 -d":" >>/etc/d_passwd

This appends the new dialup onto the end of the d_passwd file.


iii)

Edit the file with vi to place the new encrypted password
in the appropriate fields marked XXXX below:


/usr/lib/uucp/uucico::
/usr/bin/ksh:XXXX:
/usr/bin/sh:XXXX:
