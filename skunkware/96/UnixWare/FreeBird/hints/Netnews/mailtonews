Subject: Mail to News gateway for Cnews


Attached are two files, one a prog called injectmail and
the other mailtonews.cfg.  These can be integrated into Cnews and
the stock mail subsystem as follows:


In /etc/mail/mailsurr we have a rule as follows:

'.+'    'mailtonews'            '</usr/lib/newsbin/input/injectmail  "%S" "%O" "%R"'

And in /etc/mail/newsaliases we have

# mailalias   accepted for mailtonews filtering

local.foo       mailtonews
example2        mailtonews


(Note we add the name /etc/mail/newsaliases to the end of /etc/mail/namefiles)

The injectmail script is in /usr/lib/newsbin/input
