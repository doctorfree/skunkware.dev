To enable printing under DOS Merge add this line to /autoexec.bat :-

printer lpt1 unix "lp -dpost"


Where post is your printer name.

Other commands may be added for example :-

printer lpt1 unix "postprint | lp -dpost"

Will get UNIX to do a ascii to postscript conversion thus enabling you
to print ascii files under DOS.
