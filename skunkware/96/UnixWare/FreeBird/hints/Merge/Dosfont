This is from Web Server at www.novell.com:

FYI:Changing the font in a DOS Merge window

SOLUTION

Edit /usr/X/lib/app-defaults/DOS and look for dos*dosfont. 

You can replace the default of 'auto' with almost any
font found in the /usr/X/lib/fonts/misc directory. 

If you don't want to change the system default, you can also 
change it on  a per user basis by adding an entry to 
your ~/.Xdefaults-<host>, where <host>
is the nodename of your machine. This then  overrides the system 
default resource.

A Merge window requires it to be a fixed font, so any one will do. 
NOTE:Don't put an extension on the font name, like snf or bdf, for 
example:

dos*dosfont:                               8x14pc

This may not work on an Xterminal or Xterminal emulator because it may 
not have that font available.
