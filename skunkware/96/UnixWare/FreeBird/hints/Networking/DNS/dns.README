The file dns.tar is from ora.com and accompanies the book DNS and BIND.
It contains some tools for administering DNS.
The most useful tool is the h2n script which can setup DNS named
files based on a hosts file.

Many of the tools use perl.

Also in this directory is a simple overview of how to use the h2n
script to setup DNS - see the files HOWTO.DNS and dnstools.shar
