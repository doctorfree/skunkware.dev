This file contains a news article on bootp.
Also note the following files are available on this mail-server:
	bootptab.sample.UW1
	bootptab.sample.UW2
	rfc1048.txt 
	rfc951.txt

ALSO SEE internet/systools/bootptest.tar.Z for a tool to test bootp on UnixWare.

ALSO SEE internet/server/bootpd for syslogd instrumented versions of in.bootpd

For setting up syslogd see systools/syslog*

One thing to note is that the bootptab format has changed between 
UnixWare 1.x and UnixWare 2.x - see the man page for bootptab and
also see the Dynatext in UW2.x which has a good section on setting
up a bootp server.

The bootp server also works fine.
Just edit the file /etc/inet/bootptab - the database for the bootp server.
This contains an example.


Check your /etc/inet/inetd.conf file:

bootps	dgram	udp	wait	root	/usr/sbin/in.bootpd		in.bootpd

Check you have entries in /etc/services (should be there by default)
/etc/inet/services:bootps		67/udp		bootp


If you're TCP is wrapped, 

Edit /etc/inet/hosts.allow
in.bootpd: ALL

Edit /etc/inet/inetd.conf
bootps	dgram	udp	wait	root	/usr/sbin/wrapd		in.bootpd

Remember to restart inetd.
