This is version 1.1  of my PPP setup document.  Hopefully, I have
learned a little more about PPP setup now, and this document will be
more useful.  Specifically, references to /etc/gateways and /etc/networks
have been removed, and replaced with procedures to setup a default
route.  It's not a finished document yet, but I do believe it can be
of help.  If you've run into something I should add, please let me know.

Enjoy...Bob

*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*


Welcome to the trials and tribulations of setting up a PPP connection.
This document will explain what I did to my system to get "on the net"
via my Internet provider.  This document is geared toward users of 
Novell's Unixware, and probably doesn't apply to other systems.


Documentation:

First of all, it would be preferable if you had a full set of Unixware
manuals, specifically including the TCP/IP & NFS - TCP/IP Administration
manual.  Failing that, you SHOULD go out and purchase the Novell's Guide
to UnixWare 1.1 book. It's about two inches thick, and has most of the
stuff you are ever likely to need to administer your Unixware system.

You CAN perform the steps in this document without either of these books,
but you may not understand some of the steps, and may damage your system
by doing something incorrectly.



Setup:

The first step is to run pppconf.  There are man pages explaining this,
and they can be accessed from flib as well.

You must be the root user to run pppconf.
$ su
Password:xxxxxxx

Run pppconf
# pppconf


PPP Configuration Menu

1) Configure PPP hosts
2) Configure incoming PPP parameters
3) Configure PPP authentication parameters
q)

Enter choice: 1

Configure PPP Hosts

1) Add/modify PPP hosts
2) Remove PPP hosts
q) Quit

Enter choice: 1

Enter IP address for local PPP end: from the fax from provider Your IP Address

Enter IP address for remote PPP end: 105.105.105.105

Note: This was not supplied by provider on my fax.  I used a DOS comms
program to try to log onto provider on my PPP ID, and looked at the
output to see their PPP server ID.

Enter netmask("-" for default) ... : 255.255.255.0

..
Enter UUCP name("-" for null) ...: dial-internet

Note: The UUCP name is the name in the /etc/uucp/Systems file that you
will be setting up to dial provider to make the PPP connection.

Do you want to specify PPP negotiation parameters? (y/n) y

PPP connection inactivity timeout in minutes("-" for forevere)...: 5

Timeout per PPP protocol request in seconds [3]: press enter

Maxium number of ppp configure requests [10]: press enter

Maxium number of ppp termination requests [2]: press enter

Maxium receive unit size in bytes [???]: 1152

Note: This number is pretty important.  It appears that it must be a
multiple of 576 in order for routing to work through PPP.

Async control character map in hex [00000000]: press enter

PPP peer authentication timeout in minutes [1]: press enter

#

This puts you back at the prompt, and the PPP configuration is complete.
Actually, you need to reboot, but that will be done in the following
steps.  The next step is to configure the IP driver to forward IP traffic.

# cd /etc/conf/pack.d/ip
# lc
Driver.o space.c   stubs.c
# cp space.c space.c.bak
# vi space.c

Note: This section assumes that you have knowledge of how to use the vi
editor.  If you don't, STOP NOW, and GET HELP. You can also use another
editor of your choice if you have an alternate editor available on your
system.


In the file space.c you will find the following line:

#define IPFORWARDING 0


Change the 0 to a 1 so that it reads:
#define IPFORWARDING 1

Now save the file, and quit from your editor.

The next step is to rebuild the kernel.  You do this by making the 
following entry:

# /etc/conf/bin/idbuild -B

This will take several minutes to complete.

After the rebuild finishes, shut it down, and reboot it.  It should come
up normally, with no new messages.


PPP Connection:

Note: In the following 105.105.105.105 is the IP address assigned to
your UW machine by your Internet provider.

The next step is to establish just which ppp connection is used for 
provider.  To do this, type the following:

$ su
# Password: .....
# ifconfig -a

You will see something similar to the following:

ppp0: flags=11<UP,POINTOPOINT>
        inet 198.68.161.155 --> 105.105.105.105 netmask ffffff00

Make note of the ppp connection number pointing to 105.105.105.105 
and write its number down, in this case ppp0.

Next enter the following:

# ifconfig ppp0 down

This shuts the ppp connection down for now.

Now change to the /etc/rc2.d directory

# cd /etc/rc2.d

You will need to add another startup file to shut down the ppp connection
each time the machine is booted.  Otherwise, the machine will go ahead
and dial your Internet provider, and the cash register will start ringing
for nothing.


file: /etc/rc2.d/S99ppp0 contains 1 line:
ifconfig ppp0 down


Summary:
At this point, you have the kernel rebuilt with forwarding turned on. This
allows you to connect to other networks via DNS.  You also have PPP
configured to allow you to connect to your Internet provider.

In the next steps you will enable the comm port, and define your Internet
provider in the Systems file.

Comm Port:

>From the desktop select System_Setup.
>From within System_Setup select Dialup_Setup.
>From within Dialup_Setup selct Actions and then Setup Devices.
>From within Devices select Device and New.
>From within Device Properties select Other.
Now, if your mouse uses tty00 (com1) enter tty01h. If your mouse uses 
tty01 (com2) enter tty00h.

Note: You need to use ttynnh NOT ttynn, as the 'h' indicates hardware
flow control.

Select apply, and close all the windows opened for this operation.

At this point, you have defined the device attached to the modem.


System:

Now we are going to setup the system in the Systems file.  There is a 
way to do this via the desktop, but the desktop seems to have a bug in 
that it always creates a uucp user, so we will use vi again.  The same
caveats apply, if you don't know how to use vi, GET HELP.


>From the command line type:
$ su
# vi /etc/uucp/Systems

enter a line at the end of the Systems file as follows:


dial-internet Any ACU 38400 number "" \r\d "" \r\d in:--in: Puser word: password

Note: If you are connecting to a UW server, the UW manual specifies that you
add yright after the password.  This is to cause PPP to search for the
keyword Copyright before connecting, i.e:

dial-internet Any ACU 38400 number "" \r\d "" \r\d in:--in: Puser word: password yright

In the above:
   38400:    the line speed, depends on your modem.
   number:   the phone number you will dial to connect to provider.
   Puser:    the userid assigned to you. Check your fax.
   password: the password assigned to you. Check your fax.


Save the Systems file, and we will finish things up with just a couple more
files.


PPP Control:

These files control whether your system connects to your provider or not.
Since your provider charges you by the minute you will want to disconnect
whenever you are not actually using the Internet.  These are some 
small files, and I am just going to list them and their contents.
These files should all be created by root (su).

Note: You will need to know the root password to execute internet.up and
internet.down.

file: /usr/bin/internet.up contains 2 lines:
#! /sbin/sh
su - root /usr/bin/ppp.up ppp0


file: /usr/bin/internet.down contains 2 lines:
#! /sbin/sh
su - root /usr/bin/ppp.dn ppp0


file: /usr/bin/ppp.up contains 3 lines:
#! /sbin/sh
/usr/sbin/ifconfig $1 up
/usr/sbin/route add default providers.ip.address 1


file: /usr/bin/ppp.dn contains 3 lines:
#! /sbin/sh
/usr/sbin/ifconfig $1 down
/usr/sbin/route delete default providers.ip.address


Watch out for the ' (single quote) and ` (unshifted ~). The single quotes
surround the {print $2}, the others are unshifted tilde keystrokes.

The internet.up and internet.down allows users to bring the ppp connection up
and down.  However, they will have to know the root password to run them.
If you don't want to give that out, you will have to bring the line up
and down yourself, (recommended).

The p0.up and p0.dn files first set the ppp connection up or down,
and then either add or delete the default route.  This is needed because
ppp seems to want to consider itself the same as a physical connection,
rather than as a dialup.


HANG IN THERE, IT'S ALMOST OVER!


Create a new file as follows:

file: /etc/resolv.conf has several lines, you will have to get the 
values from your provider:
domain provider.net
nameserver 138.67.162.241
nameserver 145.98.12.140
nameserver 172.28.48.73


file: /etc/hosts: add the following lines:
138.67.162.3	provider.name


Starting up TCP/IP:

If you haven't already done so, it's time to start up TCP/IP.  Use the
desktop again, and do the following:

>From the desktop enter System_Setup.
>From System_Setup enter Internet_Setup.
Select System and New.
Enter your machine name, and select Show Full Address.
Enter the TCP/IP address supplied to you by provider, and select apply.

It's finally time to start checking things out.  

Enter the following:

$ cu dial-internet

Your modem should now dial up the provider system, and you should see a
login prompt.  Enter the ppp userid given to you by provider.  The
system will prompt you for a password.  Enter the one provided by 
provider.

The system should respond with a bunch of gibberish.  The first few
characters of which should contain both your TCP/IP address and your
provider's.  Verify that the provider's IP address matches what you
were told it would be, and what you entered in pppconf.  Press ~. or 
just close the window to close the connection.  Your modem should hang up.

If everything is ok up to now, it's time to try out the ppp connection.


Enter the following:

$ internet.up

After a few moments, your modem should dial the provider system and
connect.  If not, ping your internet provider with the following entry
(as root):

ping -s providers.name

Your machine should dial your provider and connect.  At this point you
will be getting ping response messages, and you can kill the ping.

Note: Normally, I just kick off Mosaic and tin, leaving them to cause the
connection to start up.

If this doesn't work for you, go back and check all the steps above.
If it still doesn't work, consult your UW books or the Novell Guide I
mentioned.  Like I said, this worked for me, and it probably will work
for you.  However, PPP setup can be a pain depending on your provider, etc.

When everything is working, the first ftp site you will probably want to 
contact is:

ftp.novell.de

This is the German Novell site.  They have much more stuff than the US
site.  Use ftp as the userid, and your mailid as your password.  Your 
mailid is user@machine.domain.name. For example: joe@foo.abc.com.

You will probably want to download tin, elm, Mosaic, and xarchie as your 
first downloads.
