After exploring the combinatorics of the PPP configure options on both
ends, I finially hit upon one which works:

    UnixWare's /etc/inet/ppphosts:
	###.###.###.### - systemname mru=296 nomgc protcomp accomp VJ old

    Solaris's /etc/asppp.cf:
	ifconfig ipdptp0 plumb thisname thatname up
	path
	    interface ipdptp0
	    peer_system_name systemname
		inactivity_timeout 0
		ipcp_async_map 00000000
		lcp_mru 296

Note the "old" keyword in UW's ppphosts configuration.  That and "nomgc"
seem to be the keys on the UW side, while "ipcp_async_map 00000000"
was the trick on the Sun side.  The only thing I needed on the Solaris
side to make the remote system visible to the net was:

	arp -s thatname ##:##:##:##:##:## pub

using the gateway system's ethernet address.  The UnixWare end has a
"route add default thisname 3" to give it access to the world.
