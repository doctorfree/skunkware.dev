A feature of NFS is that the number of free inodes is always -1.

Although SVR4.2/UnixWare conforms to this correctly, this can cause some
applications to fail.  These applications check the free-inodes to see how much
disk space is availble.  This is incorrect.

A package is available which causes NFS to return a real number for the
free-inodes thus enabling these "broken" applications to work.

Please contact "plord@uel.co.uk" for the package.
