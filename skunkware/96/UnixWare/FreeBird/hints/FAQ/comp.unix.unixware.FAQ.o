UnixWare Frequently Asked Questions List (Overview)

Introduction

This is the Overview section of the UnixWare Frequently Asked Questions
file maintained on the Internet for the Usenet newsgroup
comp.unix.unixware.misc. Its maintainer is Andrew Josey
(andrew@tamarix.demon.co.uk). Suggestions and contributions are always welcome.

The FAQ is divided into the following categories:

* (O) Overview, this document describing other documents which compose the
      total UnixWare FAQ and pointers to other UnixWare resources.
* (D) Developer, for items of interest to software developers/programmers
* (A) Autoconfiguration, describing use of the Device Configuration Utility(DCU)
* (M) Mailsurr, describing the  Email system
* (T) Troubleshooting, describing installation and miscellaneous topics
* (G) General, for items of nonspecific interest

(The following are now looking a bit dated and could do with
an update)

* (U) User, for items of interest to general users
* (S) SysAdmin, for items of interest to UnixWare system administrators

Each of these category is now a separate file; together, along with this
overview, they are the UnixWare FAQ. They are posted to the Internet
newsgroups  comp.unix.unixware.misc and comp.unix.unixware.announce, and
related groups, including news.answers and comp.answers, roughly once a
month. Readers of these files with access to the Internet should be able
to find them archived in the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu and
available by anonymous ftp (we're still working on this and
hope to get this sorted real soon now). Its location is:

  ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/unix-faq/unixware/

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) versions of these documents may be
found at the following locations:

  http://photobooks.gatech.edu/

  ftp://www.calvacom.fr/Unixware/

[Please note , that due to the recent transition to split the FAQ
there may be some delay before the archive versions make it to rtfm.mit.edu
and also before the HTML versions appear]

These FAQs can also be obtained by email from the Novell UK mail server
by the the following method:

* Send email to mail-server@novell.co.uk
* Send the following as the text of the message (the subject is unimportant):

     begin
     send hints/FAQ/comp.unix.unixware.FAQ
     end

* The  FAQs are available within the ftp.abs.net freebird archive
in the directory /unixware/freebird/hints/FAQ.

UnixWare RESOURCE POINTERS

This section gives pointers to other UnixWare resources.
Suggestions and contributions to be added to this section
are always welcome.

O1) Where can I get  Freeware and shareware for UnixWare?
O2) Where can I get Information on setting up Internet Services on UnixWare?
O3) What is PDF and where can I get a PDF viewer for UnixWare?


Subject: O1) Where can I get  Freeware and shareware for UnixWare?

The Freebird archive (from ftp.abs.net)  is a set of unsupported freeware 
software ported to UnixWare. Sources and binaries are included, often the
binaries are in pkgadd format for ease of installation.

The archive can be accessed by electronic mail, WWW or ftp.

Electronic mail:

The mail-server can be reached as mail-server@novell.co.uk,
send a message containing the following text to receive an overview
document and instruction on how to use the mail-server.

	begin
	send overview
	end

World Wide Web (W3)

Check out on the WWW:
      ftp://ftp.abs.net/unixware/freebird

File Transfer Protocol (ftp)

The PRIMARY FTP SITES that hold the Freebird archive are  as follows:

Name:   ftp.abs.net
Contact: Howard Leadmon (ftp-admin@abs.net)
Address: 206.42.80.130
Directory: /unixware/freebird

Name:    netlab1.usu.edu

Directory: /pub/unixware/freebird

Name:    netlab2.usu.edu
Address:  129.123.1.44  
Directory: /freebird

(we expect to add more soon)

Subject: O2) Where can I get Information on setting up Internet Services 
             on UnixWare?

A list of pointers to freely available information is included below
(this document can also be obtained from ftp.abs.net 
in /unixware/freebird/internet/uwirg.README)

In this issue, all the resources can be located in the 
Freebird archive and can be obtained by a number of ways:

	Electronic mail, WWW and  Ftp

A pointer is given below as a relative pathname within the Freebird
archive, see later section on how to access the archive. Relative
pathnames are prefixed by an identifier to let you know if its
a file or a directory , for example:
	file: path/to/file

(0) UnixWare 2 As an Internet Access Server (HTML Presentation)

This gives an overview  on setting up UnixWare as an internet access server.

This talk given at Brainshare 95 (Novell's annual technical conference) 
describes how UnixWare can be used as an Internet Access Server. It
gives examples of services provided by an internet server,
it compares and contrasts the options for physical connections
to the access provider and then gives details on setting up
the following services on UnixWare:

	Anonymous ftp, HyperText Protocol Daemon (World Wide Web Server),
	Gopher, Electronic Mail, Post Office Protocol, Usenet News,
	Domain Name Service, Bootp protocol, TCP Service Wrappers.

The talk is provided in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) which allows
it to be viewed using a World Wide Web Browser, such as Mosaic or 
Netscape.
