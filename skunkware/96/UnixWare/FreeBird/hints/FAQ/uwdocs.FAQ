Below is the first issue of a FAQ devoted to UnixWare documentation. Some of
this material is taken from the UnixWare FAQ and from other periodic postings
to this newsgroup, while some is new material. Since we documentation
folks don't always get a lot of interaction with customers, we hope this
FAQ will answer your questions about our documents, and hopefully spur
comments and feedback on what you like and don't like about them, and how we
can make them better and more useful. Your comments are invited.

3.4  What books on UnixWare system administration might I
read/purchase?

For the UNIX Press 4.2 and 4.2 MP books, see the list in 3.2 above.

  One of the points of UnixWare is the integration of Netware
  with Unix. "Novell's Guide to Integrating UNIX and
  NetWare Networks" by James E. Gaskin, published by Novell Press is
  a *very* current book (1993) and amongst other things offers thoughts on
  topics like why netware for UNIX is not available on UnixWare.
  It is sprinkled with humour.

  Jerry Peek, Tim O'Reilly, and Mike Loukides
  O'Reilly and Associates/Random House 1993
  ISBN 0-679-79073-X

This book combines 1000+ pages of text-mode UNIX advice with a CD-ROM of
precompiled binaries for various popular UNIX platforms (including SCO, which
should run on UnixWare) of a large variety of useful text-mode applications. 


3.5  What books on UnixWare programming might I read/purchase?

For the UNIX Press 4.2 and 4.2 MP books, see the list in 3.2 above

  O'Reilly and Associates, Inc.
  ISBN 0-937175-73-0


4. UNIXWARE 1.x QUESTIONS
----------------------

4.1  Why has fingertip librarian in UnixWare 1.0 suddenly stopped working?

An authorization code file for the flib shipped with release 1.0
inexplicably carried an expiration date of 12/31/93. There is a trivial
fix for this: 

  $ mv /usr/flib/authorization /usr/flib/authorization.old

flib should now work again. This problem has been fixed in v1.1. 

4.2  How can I access the standard UNIX man pages from the command
line?

Include the following in your shell startup files: 

 .profile (/usr/bin/sh or /usr/bin/ksh): 

  MANPATH=/usr/flib/books/man
  export MANPATH
  PATH=$PATH:/usr/ucb

 .cshrc (/usr/bin/csh): 

  setenv MANPATH /usr/flib/books/man
  set path=($path /usr/ucb)

Or, talk to your system administrator about setting up the symbolic links
for the man pages.

The following symbolic links will enable users to access the standard UNIX man
pages without further action on their part: 

  ln -s /usr/flib/books/man /usr/share/man
  ln -s /usr/flib/bin/fman /usr/bin/man

4.3   Why can't I search for patterns in manual page output?

The traditional UNIX manual pages are not shipped in their troff
source form, but instead are shipped in preprocessed (catman)
format. (You won't find any man[0-9] directories in
/usr/flib/books/man, only cat[0-9].) These preprocessed man pages
contain copious backspaces, intended for creating emphasis
(underlining, and so on) when printed out on a screen (using
appropriate output filters) or on paper.  Unfortunately, all those
backspaces confound attempts to search through the output of man
piped directly into more (the standard method). The way to get
around this is to pipe man output as follows:

  man topic | col -b | more

In UnixWare 2.0, you can also search for patterns using the DynaText browser.
The books in each Collection have Search menus that enable you to create search
"panels," find out about search histories, and so on.

See Question 5.2 under "UNIXWARE 2.0 QUESTIONS" for an overview of the
DynaText browser.

4.4  I have the SDK and can't find the Motif man pages.

That's because Novell didn't expand the filenames in UnixWare 1.X..  By
default, OSF ships them with short names so they can work on systems with
the old 14-character filename limit.  The files exist, they're just named
wrong.

In UnixWare 2.0, the Motif man pages are available in the DynaText browser
under the "Reference Docs" Collection, and in "Motif" under "Books."
Full filenames (even those with more than 14 characters) are used on each
man page.

The Motif man pages are not available through the man command in UnixWare 2.0.

4.5  There is an error in the Installation Handbook, page 45 in the 1.0
     documentation, (page 51 for 1.1) has errors and confusing instructions 
     for installing the nuc.nlm.
 
________________________________________
Step 4 states to Press  to load new product.

It should state to press the .

________________________________________
Step 6 states to enter the "diskette" drive letter that 
NetWare will boot from and gives the example of "F:".
 
This should simply be the "drive" letter that NetWare 
will boot from and the example should be "C:".
 
________________________________________
Steps 7 states to select Install at the NetWare Client 
Installation Options menu.
 
There is no such option when loading nuc.nlm under 
UnixWare 1.1 and should be ignored.
 
________________________________________
Step 8 does not report back whether the files are loaded 
successfully; however, the files NFSUSERS, NFSGROUP and 
NFSPARAM do get created.
 
At the completion of loading nuc.nlm the screen is left 
blank.  To return to the system console press the 
+ keys.


4.6  There is a problem on page 84 of the UnixWare 1.1 documentation for TCP/IP
about pinging any hosts by name with resolv.conf.setup.

It instructs users to edit the /etc/netconfig file to 
use the resolv.conf.  Because of the way the 
documentation was printed, it looks as though each entry 
should take up two lines.  The line in the manual that 
appears as follows:
 
tcp  tpi_cots_ord   v    inet tcp  /usr/lib/resolv.so,
     /usr/lib/tcpip.so


The resolv.conf should appear as follows:
 
     tcp  tpi_cots_ord   v    inet tcp
     /usr/lib/resolv.so,/usr/lib/tcpip.so

The other three lines printed in the manual should be 
used in the same format as documented.

5. UNIXWARE 2.0 QUESTIONS
----------------------

5.1  What are the documentation differences between UnixWare 1.x and
    UnixWare 2.0?

All of the documentation shipped with the product,
with the exceptions of the Installation Handbook, the Release Notes, and
the package Overview and Installation booklets, is available online.

This release does not use the Fingertip Librarian browser for
online documentation, as did UnixWare 1.x. UnixWare 2.0 uses the
DynaText online browser produced by Electronic Book Technologies
(EBT). This is the same online browser system used in NetWare 4.x.
The browser is provided as a separate package, and each product,
the Application Server, the Personal Edition, and the Software
Development Kit, has a package of documents that can be installed and
viewed using DynaText.

The documentation packages for this release are:

manpages- the traditional manual pages, man(1), apropos(1), etc.
dynatext- the DynaText online browser
ASdocs-   the online documentation supplied with the Application Server
PEdocs-   the online documentation supplied with the Personal Edition
SDKdocs-  the online documentation supplied with the Software
          Development Kit
ODMdocs-  the online documentation supplied with the Veritas
          Online Data Manager

A new book has been added to the documentation set: the System
Owner Handbook. This book is intended primarily for users who
will have to maintain and administer their individual UnixWare
systems. This is not restricted to the standalone Personal Edition
system, but includes material on topics like networking. The
System Administration Guide included in previous releases is also
provided for users who must administer several systems or an entire
network.

The three handbooks, the Installation Handbook, the Desktop User
Handbook, and the System Owner Handbook, are provided on paper
as part of the product. The only book that is not available on
line (paper only) is the Installation Handbook.


The manual pages are browsable using the DynaText browser.
Like previous releases, UnixWare 2.0 also provides support for the 
man(1) command to allow users to view manual pages from the
command line. All of the pages and the relevant commands have been
placed in a separate package, the manpages package. This package
is provided with the Application Server and Personal Edition, but it
is not installed by default. The version of the man command used in
2.0 has been changed slightly. Users can now specify the name of
the routine and man will find the correct page, even if the page
is named something else.

For example, the string(3C) page documents a number of related functions,
including one called strchr. Previously, if you wished to 
view the man page for strchr, you had to know (or find out, using
the apropos(1) command) that you wanted the string(3C) page.
That is, you had to enter:

man string

to see the manual page that covered strchr. Now you can simply type

man strchr

and you will get the string(3C) page, which documents the strchr
function.


5.2  Can you give me a quick sketch of DynaText?

DynaText is an SGML-based online browser that incorporates hyperlinks,
public and private annotations, and a variety of search
strategies, including exact match, title match, proximity
searches, and more.

The browser uses a configuration file, called
the .ebtrc file, to find the books and support files. Users can
customize this file to suit their own needs. A default .ebtrc file
is provided upon installation. Since the browser searches
for this file in several locations in a particular order (see 5.7 for
more on this), it is
possible to set up a system-wide default .ebtrc file, while still
allowing individual users to use a customised .ebtrc.

The browser groups books into collections. Users select
collections, and then choose from the list of displayed books.
More than one book can be open at a given time, and the browser
will open new books as necessary; this can happen if a user
selects a hyperlink that references a different book, such as a
guide chapter referencing a manual page.

5.4  The online books take up a great deal of space. 
    How do I set up DynaText to run over the network using TCP/IP?

What follows is the quick and dirty way to do this. You will end
up with some duplicate files on systems that are remotely
accessing the books, but, assuming no one changes their .ebtrc
file to put annotations somewhere else, all public annotations 
will be accessible to anyone who can access the books.
This method will also put the proper support files (icons, etc.)
in place.

You can find a more detailed and complete procedure for doing this
in the System Owner Handbook, Appendix B.

   1. Install the DynaText browser on the machine that will serve the
      documentation and on the machines that you want to access the
      documentation.

   2. Install the desired documentation packages on the machine that
      will serve the documentation to the other systems. You must choose
      the same installation directory that you
      chose in step 1.

   3. On the machine that will serve the books, advertise the 
      directory containing the books and browser. If you installed
      in the default place, this will be /usr/doc. You can use
      the GUI desktop to do this, or use the command line.

      From the command line, running as root, type

	share -F nfs /usr/doc
	
      OR, from the GUI, running as a privileged user, do the following:

	a. Double-click on the Admin_Tools folder. This will open
	   the Admin_Tools window. 
	
	b. Double-click on the Networking Folder. This will open
	   the Networking window.
	
	c. Double-click on the File_Sharing icon. This will open
	   the File Sharing Setup folder.
	
	d. If the title bar for the File Sharing Setup folder says
	   "Remote Share Items", change the view by clicking
	   and holding on the View menu button. Select Local.
	   This should change the window contents and the title
	   bar should now say "Local Share-Items".
	
	e. Click and hold on the Share-Item menu button, and select
	   "New" from the menu. This will bring up a window
	   entitled: "File Sharing: Add New Share-Item - Local".
	
	f. Fill in the form and click on "Add" to advertise the
	   directory.
	
	g. Close the "File Sharing Setup", Networking, and Admin_Tools
	   windows.

   4. On the systems that will be accessing the books remotely, mount
      the advertised directory locally on the same directory. For
      example, if the system serving the online docs is called fred,
      and the material advertised is in the
      default DynaText installation directory, /usr/doc:

      From the command line, as root, type

	   mount -F nfs fred:/usr/doc /usr/doc
	
      You could also place the appropriate line in the /etc/vfstab
      file to mount this filesystem at boot time.

      OR, from the GUI, running as a privileged user, do the following:

	a. Double-click on the Admin_Tools folder. This will open
	   the Admin_Tools window. 
	
	b. Double-click on the Networking Folder. This will open
	   the Networking window.
	
	c. Double-click on the File_Sharing icon. This will open
	   the File Sharing Setup folder.
	
	d. If the title bar for the File Sharing Setup folder says
	   "Local Share Items", change the view by clicking
	   and holding on the View menu button. Select "Remote".
	   This should change the window contents and the title
	   bar should now say "Remote Share-Items".
	
	e. Click and hold on the Share-Item menu button, and select
	   "New" from the menu. This will bring up a window
	   entitled: "File Sharing: Add New Share-Item - Remote".
	
	f. Fill in the form and click on "Add" to advertise the
	   directory. Make sure the folder name is the correct one
	   and from the correct system. The local folder name must
	   be the same as the share item name.

	g. Close the "File Sharing Setup", Networking, and Admin_Tools
	   windows.

5.5  How do I set up DynaText as a Shared Application using IPX?

This is easier to do than using NFS, but annotations will not
be properly displayed in all cases. Users accessing the browser
remotely in this manner will find their public annotations disappear
from session to session, if they do not have an account on the 
remote system. Users local to that system can still see the
annotations, however.

Again, you can also find instructions on doing this in Appendix B of the
System Owner Handbook.

Perform the following steps:

   1. On the system that will be serving the browser, open a window
      containing the browser icon.

   2. Double-click on the Application Sharing icon in the Admin_Tools
      folder. This will bring up the "Shared Applications" window.

   3. Click and hold on the browser icon, and drag it over to the
      Shared Applications window. Release the mouse button. The
      list of applications should now include the "Online_Docs"
      application.

   4. This is a graphical application. If "Online_Docs" is listed
      as a Text Application, click on the entry to highlight it.
      Then click on the "Choose Type" button at the bottom of
      the window. This will toggle the type to the correct
      setting, "Graphical Application".

The browser is now advertised on the system.
To access the browser from another system, do the following:

   1. Click on the Remote_Applications icon in the Applications
      folder.
   
   2. Select the name of the system that is advertising the browser.
      You may be asked for a login name and password for the
      remote system.

   3. Select "Online_Docs" from the list of applications displayed.

   4. Click on "Open" to start the browser. You can click on the
      "Make_Icon" button to make an icon for this application.
      In this case, you merely have to click on the icon in future
      to start the browser.

5.6  How do I include collections of books served from another system?

In some cases, you may want to have some books local to systems,
and others served from a remote system. This may be because of
space or speed considerations.

   1. Advertise the directory containing the collection.

   2. Mount the advertised directory on the local system. The mount
      point must be underneath the Libraries

   3. Add a line to the .ebtrc file denoting the new collection. The
      line should be of the form:

COLLECTION<tab><path>=<Description>

where:
<tab> represents a tab character
<path> represents the mount point you used in step 2
<Description> is the Collection Title (e.g. Programming Guides)

For example, suppose you had mounted the SDK reference books in
/usr/doc/Libraries/C/sdkref, and you wanted the collection listed
as "Programming Guides". The line added to your .ebtrc file
would read:

COLLECTION	/usr/doc/Libraries/C/sdkref=Programming Guides

The collection should now show up in the browser's collection list.

5.7  A collection/book doesn't show up under DynaText. What do I do?

-Make sure you are using the correct .ebtrc file. Remember, DynaText
 checks for the file in several places and uses the first .ebtrc
 it finds. It checks, in order:

 - $EBTRC, if you have it defined in the current environment
 - .ebtrc in the current directory
 - $HOME/.ebtrc
 - /etc/opt/dynatext/ja/.ebtrc (only if you are running with Japanese locale)
 - /etc/opt/dynatext/.ebtrc

-Is the collection in the .ebtrc file?

	Once you've established which .ebtrc file is being used,
	check it contains a COLLECTION line for the collection you
	think should be there.

-Is the .ebtrc file you are using properly ordered?

	If you have the same collection specified from multiple sources
	(CD, network, local files), DynaText will use the first instance
	to resolve all references, such as searches, hyperlink jumps
	and so on. This is only a problem if you have a collection
	specified twice, and the files for the collection stored
	in two different places. The Reference collection
	is a possibility, as the PE, AS and SDK all have Reference
	collections, but the SDK reference collection has
	a larger set of books. Note, however, that this is not
	a problem if you installed both the ASdocs and the SDKdocs in
	the default directory (/usr/doc). In this case, since both
	collections refer to the same path, all of the books
	will be checked for search matches and hyperlink jumps.
	It is only a possible problem if you installed different
	collections in different directories.

	For example, if you installed the ASdocs in the default
	directory (/usr/doc), and the SDKdocs in a different
	directory (say /home/doc), then all searches and hyperlink
	jumps for the References collection will be resolved
	against the first References collection (AS or SDK)
	listed in the .ebtrc file you are using.
	
-Is the collection supplied remotely?

	Collections may be served from other systems. If the serving
	system is down, or there is a network problem, the files
	may not be available on the local machine. Check to see if
	there are files under the directory defined in the
	COLLECTION line.
	
-Is the collection supplied via CD?

	Verify the CD is mounted, and mounted on the correct
	mount point (/installr), using the mount(1M) command.
	Make sure it is the correct CD.
	
-Is the correct package installed?

	Verify that the package containing the collection of interest
	is installed. See elsewhere in this FAQ for a breakdown.

5.8  How does DynaText handle printing?

DynaText can send output, ranging from individual sections to
entire books, in PostScript form, to printers. You must have
previously configured the printers on the system using the lpadmin
command; using Printer_Setup from the GUI won't work.

5.9  I decided to print the entire Command Reference, and the browser
    just sits there with a notice window that says
    "Printing...". What's going on?

Although you can send entire books to the printer, we don't
recommend you do this except for smaller books. Printing
requires a great deal of memory, and runs in the foreground, which
means you can't do anything with the browser until the print job
is completely assembled and shipped off to the printer. 
If the book is so large that the system runs out of main memory,
and is forced to start swapping, the wait time increases
exponentially. We recommend that you print individual chapters or
manual pages rather than entire books.

5.10  How do I tell DynaText about printers?

At run time, DynaText reads in information about printers from a
file called config.dat, stored in data/ps underneath the
installation directory. So, for instance, if you installed
DynaText in the default directory, /usr/doc, this file
would be found in /usr/doc/data/ps/config.dat.

At the top of the file, you'll find a list of printers, one per
line. Each line has the format:
name<whitespace>width<whitespace>height<whitespace>command

"name" is the printer name. "width" and "height" refer to the page
width and page height, expressed in the usual PostScript standard
of 72 units to the inch. A standard 8.5 x 11 inch paper size
would therefore be expressed as a width of 612 and a height of 792.
The command is the command string used to send a PostScript job to the
printer; usually an invocation of lp. The string should
include the destination option (-d) and any default options (usually
stored in the shell variable LPOPTS. The destination must already
have been configured as a printer on the system. This procedure only
notifies DynaText about the printer.

For example, suppose you have set up two printers on your system,
diane and harry. harry is not a PostScript printer, and so cannot
be used to print DynaText output, but diane is a Postscript
printer which handles both regular letter size (8.5 x 11 inches)
and A4 size (8.27 x 11.69 inches). Suppose also that to print a
Postscript file to diane as a letter size job, you use the command

cat <file> | lp -ddiane -Tpost -y lettr

while to print to diane as an A4-size job, you use

cat <file> | lp -ddiane -Tpost -y A4

In this case, to allow users to send jobs to diane as either letter
size or A4 size, you might place the following lines in config.dat:

diane		612 792		lp -ddiane -Tpost -y lettr
dianeA4		595 841		lp -ddiane -Tpost -y A4

Once you save the file, any future executions of the browser will
present diane and dianeA4 in the list of possible choices when the user
chooses their printer.

5.11  One of my printers just died and it will be down for some time.
    Can I temporarily remove it from the list of printer choices?

Yes- any line in the config.dat file that begins with the
# character is considered a comment. You can simply comment out the
line by putting the # character at the beginning, and then remove
the # when the printer is back up.

5.12  I looked in the config.dat file and there's already an entry for a
    default printer.

This is provided primarily as an example. It will only work if the
lp options given are correct for your installation AND you have
previously defined a default printer for your system using lpadmin(1M)
with the -d option. (NOTE: You cannot use the GUI Printer Setup
method to define a default printer for this to be effective. You
must use the command line method. The GUI will only define a
default printer for you personally. You need to set the system
default destination, and for that you must use the command line.)

5.13  I'd like to scroll the display a page at a time, but the Page Up and
    Page Down Keys don't work, or else the  table of contents scroll, not
    the book text.

Put the mouse pointer in the text window and click. The window border
should change to a black outline. The Page Up and Page Down keys
should work now.

The Tab key will also change the active window. Pressing it repeatedly
will cycle you through the possible active windows. Note that some
of these windows are search windows that are usually hidden, so there
may not be any apparent change in the display if you press the key
just once. You may have to press the key several times to get the
desired window.

5.14  What are annotations?

DynaText allows you to make notes and attach them to a paragraph
of text. These notes, or annotations, can be public (placed in a file
in a common generally accessible directory) or private (placed in a
file in a subdirectory under your home directory). Note, however, that all
notes files are created with a specific set of permissions: readable by
everyone, writable by owner.  Therefore, private annotation files may
still be readable by others, though they cannot be read
inside DynaText by anyone other than you. Entries in your .ebtrc
file control where the annotations are actually placed. The
locations mentioned above are the defaults.

5.15  Where are the man pages?

The manual pages are included in the DynaText online documentation
browser. The Personal Edition and Application Server both contain the
Command Reference and System Files and Devices books, which cover
the man pages for sections 1, 1M, 4, 5, and 7. Sections 2 and 3,
the system calls and library routines, are included in the SDK.

For this release, copies of the man pages accessible via the man
command were bundled into a separate package, the manpages package.
This package is not installed by default; you must specifically
choose this package at installation time. You can also add the
manpages package to a previously installed UnixWare 2.0 system using
the pkgadd(1M) utility and your installation media.

5.16  How do I add man pages bundled with local or third-party apps so that
    the man command will see them?

Kevin Brannen (kbrannen%csfb1@uunet.uu.net) has written a periodic
posting that covers dealing with manual pages. What follows is based
on his posting and on material contained in the UnixWare 2.01 Release
Notes.

First, you must place the source files in the correct directories.

The man command expects unformatted manual page source to be located in
/usr/share/man/man?
where ? represents the section number for the page. Therefore,
unformatted source for a section 3 page would be placed in
/usr/share/man/man3.

Formatted (nroffed) pages, also known as cattable pages since they can
be directly viewed using cat(1), should be placed in /usr/share/man/cat?
where ? is again the section number for the page.

If you set the MANPATH environment variable, man will search those directories
as well as those under /usr/share/man for pages you request.

File names should be of the form <name>.<section><subsection>. 
<name>= name of manual page
<section>= section number
<subsection>= an optional single-letter subsection

So, for example,
you would find the formatted (cattable) file for uucp(1C) as
/usr/share/man/cat1/uucp.1C

You cannot add new subsections; the man command has a hard-coded list
of subsections that it recognizes.

Once you have placed the new pages in the correct location, you need to
add to the whatis database. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. Save the existing whatis database; by default, this is located in 
   /usr/share/man/whatis

2. Use the catman(1M) command to rebuild the whatis database.

3. Merge the old and new databases together.

For example, if the whatis database is in the default location, and you have
placed the source in the default location under /usr/share/man/man?

the following will rebuild your database:

cd /usr/share/man
cp whatis whatis.old
catman
sort -o whatis -df whatis whatis.old

Finally, you must format the pages using the appropriate set of man(5) macro
definitions. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. Make sure /usr/ucb is in your PATH. Enter:
	PATH=/usr/ucb:$PATH

2. Format the page. Enter:
	tbl /usr/ucblib/doctools/tmac/an <file> | nroff -Tlp -

   Where <file>= the name of the man page source file

   You can redirect the output of this to a file located in the
   appropriate directory. For example, suppose you had a manual
   page for mycall, located in section 3C. The source for the
   mycall manual page would be located in /usr/share/man/man3/mycall.3c
   The cattable nroff page would be located in /usr/share/man/cat3/mycall.3c
   and could be created:

   MPG=/usr/share/man export MPG
   tbl /usr/ucblib/doctools/tmac/an $MPG/man3/mycall.3c | nroff -Tlp - >$MPG/cat3/mycall.3c

5.17 If I click on the Online_Docs icon in the GUI to start the browser,
     and I have a CD playing in my drive, DynaText hangs, even if I
     am not using my CD drive to get documents.

This is a known problem. You can:

(1) Eject the CD from the drive and re-invoke the browser.

(2) Run the browser directly from the command line. In a Terminal window,
    enter:
    /usr/doc/lib/dtext &

    If you installed the browser in a directory other than the default,
    /usr/doc, substitute the installation directory used for /usr/doc.
