THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION UnixWare 2 

SYMPTOM

Critical system commands such as tfadmin, no longer execute.
This causes administration tools in the desktop to not function.

These symptoms could occur after doing a backup and restore of
system files, or after doing pkgchk -f.

TROUBLESHOOTING

To determine if the filepriv database is out of sync, as
superuser run the command:

     initprivs

CAUSE

System commands such as passwd, tfadmin, ftp, etc. rely on the
filepriv database to be correct.  If a file mentioned in the
filepriv database has been modified on the file system in any
way, including simply touching the file, and that change is not
reflected in the filepriv database, the command will not execute
or will not function properly.

One way to cause a lack of syncronization between the file
system and the filepriv database is by doing pkgchk -f, which
goes through the /var/sadm/install/contents file and compares
file attributes in the file, with those on the file system.  If
there is a discrepancy between the two, pkgchk changes the file
attributes on the file system to match the contents file.  Once
the file on the file system has been modified, the filepriv
database is now out of sync with the actual file.  This will
cause the symptoms above to occur.

Another way the filepriv database can become out of sync, is by
backing up and restoring system files.  This causes the 'last
update' time of the file to be modified on the file system, which
does not match the last update time in the filepriv database.

SOLUTION

To syncronize the filepriv database with the file system, run the
command:

     /etc/security/tools/setpriv -x

To check the filepriv database at any time, run the command:

     initprivs

Initprivs will return nothing if the filepriv database is in
sync with the file system.
