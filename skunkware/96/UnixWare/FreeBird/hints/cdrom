Its possible using the HBA 203 or tf2197.tar to use 
an IDE CDROM drive. (This worked for me on my Dell Dimension
XPS P100c)

This was done by the following:

(1) Boot off the UW2.01 boot floppy

(2) install 2.03 HBA disk

(3) Enter DCU

        Software Drivers
        Host Bus Adaptors

        Deselect all but the ide driver

        Select F5 for new

The primary PCI IDE controller, if used,
should be configured with:

   IRQ      14
   IOStart  1F0
   IOEnd    1FF
   MemStart  10000
   MemEnd   10001


        Select F5 for new

The secondary PCI IDE controller, if used, should be configured with:

   IRQ      15
   IOStart  170
   IOEnd    17F
   MemStart 0
   MemEnd   0
           
Go into HW Configuration again, if you have three ide controllers
switch the first to N

Then exit, save changes and apply
