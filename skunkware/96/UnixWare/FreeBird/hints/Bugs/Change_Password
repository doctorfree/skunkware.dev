If you find yourself in a situation where root can't change it's own
password and get a message like :-

# passwd root
UX:passwd: ERROR: Password may only be changed at login time
#

Then check out the permissions on /usr/bin/passwd.  In the above situation
the passwd command has the permissions :-

# ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
-r-sr-sr-x   1 andrew   sys        37776 Sep 25 00:33 /usr/bin/passwd
#

This binary program should be owned by root/sys this :-

# chown root /usr/bin/passwd; chgrp sys /usr/bin/passwd
# ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
-r-sr-sr-x   1 root     sys        37776 Sep 25 00:33 /usr/bin/passwd
#


Changing password will now work as expected.


It is suspected that this ownership change happens from the desktop.  This
problem has only been seen on SVR4.2 to date.
