Problem: My programme uses alloca() which means I have to link to
/usr/ucblib/libucb.a. When I do this the dirent routines don't work
on non-ufs filesystems.

Soln:  use the following link line:
	-B static -l c -L/usr/ucblib -lucb
It produces bigger executables but at least the directory routines
are ok.
