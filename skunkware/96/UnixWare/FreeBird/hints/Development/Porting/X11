0. How can I compile X clients without a complete X11 source tree?

  To compile most if not all X clients WITHOUT a complete X tree
  use:
      imake -I/usr/X/lib/config -DUseInstalled
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      Not necessary if you have set IMAKEINCLUDE environment variable.

  The "-DUseInstalled" directs imake to use the installed include
  and library files.

  Special note for motif applications:

  You will need three more libraries, -lXm -lXIM -lgen, during
  the link stage.  I prepend them to the following variables
  within the Imakefile like this.

               LOCAL_LIBRARIES = -lXm -lXIM [ whatever was already here ]
               SYS_LIBRARIES = -lgen [ whatever was already here ]

  This is a working solution, not necessarily the correct/elegant solution
:-)

1. Many ported programmes omit to include the networking libraries
on the compile line,

fix: include -lnsl in makefile


2. Many bitmap assignments are of the form  char [] = { 0x80, 0xFF...
The SVR4 compiler will generate a warning as it defaults to signed
char,

fix: change declarations of char to unsigned char for these arrays


3. Many ported X applications have been written for BSD - based
environments and thus use different header files and differing
structure names. Look for the -DSYSV declaration in the makefile
and enable it.
If code is not knowledgeable of SYSV, changes will be required

Fix:
For example the portable directory routines:

#ifdef SYSV
#include <dirent.h>
#else /* BSD */
#include <sys/dir.h>
#endif

and where structure members are declared:

#ifdef SYSV
        register struct dirent *d;
#else
        register struct direct *d;
#endif


4. SVR4.2 has several X libraries, if symbols are not found then define
   them.

Fix: a typical link line is

      -lXaw -lXext -lXmu -lXt -lX11 -lm -lnsl

        The OpenLook librariy is -lXol


5. xmkmf is now included in the UW 1.1 SDK , a useful tip is
to do the following:
	ln -s /usr/X/lib/config/xmkmf /usr/X/bin/xmkmf
