Some of the common BSD routines (such as bcopy, bzero etc) are not standard
in SVR4.0 et al.  These routines are available by linking with the /usr/ucblib
libraries but a better way is to either replace these routines with their
system V equivalent or to simply #define them as follows :-


# include       <memory.h>
# define        bcopy(s,d,l)    memcpy((d),(s),(l))
# define        bzero(d,l)      memset((d),0,(l))
# define        bcmp(s1,s2,l)   memcmp((s2),(s1),(l))

# include       <string.h>
# define        index(s,c)      strchr((s),(c))
# define        rindex(s,c)     strrchr((s),(c))
