After installing ELS the PC Graphic fonts may disappear on the console
terminal (lines, boxes etc).

To fix this, TERM must be adjusted to cope with ELS :-

	TERM=AT386-ie
	export TERM

or for mono displays :-

	TERM=AT386-M-ie
	export TERM

However, this may not work for applications which use TERMCAP rather than
TERMINFO.

To fix this :-

	infocmp -C AT386-ie >/tmp/out
	cat /tmp/out >>/etc/termcap

To make this TERM change perminent for new shells, the following few lines
can be added into /etc/profile :-

	if [ $TERM = AT386 ]
	then
	  TERM=AT386-ie
	  export TERM
	fi
