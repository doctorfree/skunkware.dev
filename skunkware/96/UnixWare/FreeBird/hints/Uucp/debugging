This may help (this is part of a file on UUCP tips that
was on ftp.uu.net a while back, by Jason Levitt):

Debugging UUCP
----------------

a. Find the connection server (cs) process and kill it.
Then restart it with the debug flag.
CAUTION: leaving the cs process running in debug mode may be a
serious security hole since it prints out the passwords
of systems that you dial. Also, the cs.debug file will get
really big if you don't truncate it occasionally.

[Aside: you may want to ensure that /var/adm/log/cs.debug is owned
by root and mode 600, and add the following two lines to your
root crontab:

15 01 * * * cp /dev/null /var/adm/log/cs.log
15 01 * * * cp /dev/null /var/adm/log/cs.debug

end aside]   

# ps -ef | grep cs

root   426     1  0 16:52:24 ?        0:01 /usr/sbin/cs
root  1533  1532  0 08:59:15 pts/2    0:00 grep cs
root  1532  1520  1 08:59:15 pts/2    0:00 /bin/sh -c ps -ef | grep cs

# kill -15 426
# /usr/sbin/cs -d
#
b. Open a terminal window, become superuser, and "tail -f" the log file.
Whenever outgoing "cu" or "uucico" sessions happen, you'll see the chat script
debug output in this window. You'll get some additional info if you use
/usr/lib/uucp/Uutry or "cu -d" to dialout.

# tail -f /usr/adm/log/cs.debug


c. Here's another idea. Do a truss -p on the ttymon process to see
what it's doing.

# ps -ef | grep ttymon
    root   281     1  0 12:29:28 console  0:00 /usr/lib/saf/ttymon -g -v -p Cons
ole Login:  -d /dev/syscon -l console
    root   289   280  0 12:29:31 ?        0:00 /usr/lib/saf/ttymon
# truss -p 289

4. stopping and starting the ttymon port service

These commands are equivelant to enabling and disabling the
tty port on other versions of Unix. You can do the same
thing, but slower, through the sysadm command by choosing
"ports", "port services", and then the enable and disable
selections. The command line is much faster:

Starting it:

# sacadm -s -p ttymon1

Stopping it:

# sacadm -k -p ttymon1



5. Error messages

  NO DEVICES AVAILABLE

  The tty device is not configured under a ttymon.

  DEVICE FAILED

  The tty device is configured under a ttymon but is
  not available. It's probably busy. Look for errno=16 in
  your cs.debug output.
