                                 1. GENERAL
                                       
   
   
   This document will point out some general essentials and advice on
   setting up your modem. A section at the end discusses specifics
   regarding a DOS setup running the KA9Q NET.EXE program. Due to the
   vast combinations of computer and modem setups it is impossible to
   give specific help for all types.
   
   Making an Internet (IP - Internet Protocol) connection via a modem is
   very different from a standard dial-up connection. Do not assume that
   just because you can download from a BBS (and maybe upload) or use
   other services that you have your communication (comms) set-up 100%
   sorted out. Due to the nature of IP, if you get errors, throughput can
   be hit very badly. Under IP information is sent in packets and for
   maximum speed these should generally be as large as possible up to a
   maximum of about 1500 characters. If a packet gets messed up (garbled)
   its entire contents will have to be resent - hence a large speed
   degradation may occur.
   
   One exception to this is when an interactive sessions are sharing a
   TCP/IP link with more voluminous transfers such as NNTP or SMTP. In
   this case it can be preferable to have smaller transmission units
   (Maximum Transmission Units setting or MTU) so that keystrokes/screen
   updates will fit into the data stream with less delay. If a large MTU
   is used this can lead to what feels like a jerky or intermittent
   session.
   
   Enough of the technical parts, there follows some sound advice that
   everybody should take note of.

                                2. ESSENTIALS
                                       
   
   
   Correct modem settings:
     * Full hardware handshaking (CTS/RTS),
     * Flow control
     * XON/XOFF (software handshaking) set to off
     * Settings must be bi-directional where appropriate.
     * A full specification modem cable (open yours up - if it has only 3
       wires it is no good).
     * A serial port chip that can cope with the high speeds (if using a
       high speed modem). Extended memory drivers and Terminate Stay
       Residents (TSRs) etc. can interfere with the handling of
       interrupts from serial chips.
       
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
                            3. TELEPHONE EXCHANGE
                                       
   
   
   The Demon Internet Service (DIS) is on modern digital exchanges so you
   should have little trouble with ringing tones etc. when connecting to
   us. If you are on an older exchange, your modem may not recognise the
   dialing tone. If this happens, look in your manual and change the
   setting that overrides the dial tone recognition.
   
   Note that when you make changes to a modem's settings you should
   always reset the modem first, make the change and then save the
   settings. You will need a comms or "terminal emulation" package such
   as Telix, Procomm, Window's Terminal, Z-Term, Microphone etc. Look in
   your modem manual for instructions. Mostly you will be able to type
   ATZ <return> to reset your modem. On a US Robotics/Miracom modem you
   could type:

ATZ    Reset the modem
ATX3   Alter a setting
AT&W   Write the settings to Non-Volatile RAM (NVRAM)

   
   
   The last bit (AT&W) is useful as it means that when the modem is
   reset, it will remember the settings you have stored.
   
   If going through a private telephone network (or PABX) first, you will
   probably need to dial a number such as 9 to get an outside line. Make
   sure your dial string has this in. You may need to separate this from
   the number to dial by a separator such as a comma so that there is a
   pause to give your telephone system time to give you an outside line:
   
   9,01813434848
   
   Make sure that if you're attaching your modem to a PABX line that the
   line is attached to a standard analogue line card on the switch, and
   not a specialist 4-wire (as seen on many SDX phone systems), ISDN or
   ISDT lines.
   
   Make sure that you don't have call waiting enabled on your phone line.
   The usual little beep you would hear on a line isn't too intrusive on
   a voice call, but causes havoc with modem signals. If you are unsure
   how to disable call waiting, contact your phone company. (It's
   normally #43# on BT digital exchanges)
     _________________________________________________________________
   
                             4. INTERNAL MODEMS
                                       
   
   
   Internal modems have the advantage of not having a serial lead to
   worry about, and have matched serial port chips built in, but the
   disadvantage of using an extra interrupt and generally don't have any
   lights to let you know what is going on. Ensure that the interrupt on
   which the modem sits does not interfere with any others - refer to the
   setup program for your computer and your modem manual. This may
   require altering a jumper (a small connector) on the main computer
   board (mother board) on your computer or on a separate board. This
   should be well documented and is well within the scope of the average
   user. Ensure that the modem is seated correctly in the expansion slot.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
                            5. WHICH PHONE NUMBER
                                       
   
   
   We have multiple Points of Presence (PoPs) - please see
   /pub/doc/Demon.txt for details. Thus you will have a choice of
   numbers to ring. You may use any of our PoPs at any time.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
                        6. MODEM AND TELEPHONE LEADS
                                       
   
   
   Your modem lead should be in good condition and preferably not wrapped
   in a tight circle or running parallel to high power cables etc. This
   will normally only affect longer runs and, as your cable should be
   earthed, will not often be a problem. The cable should be connected
   securely at both ends as should the telephone cable. If you suspect
   your telephone socket may be causing a problem then test it with a
   standard plug in telephone. Use the correct type of modem lead - they
   vary from country to country. Although two modem to phone socket
   cables may look identical, they are often electrically different -
   some are straight-through cables, and some cross the cables over, the
   end result can mean the "NO DIALTONE" message from your modem. If you
   have more than one modem, don't switch cables between them.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
                               7. SERIAL CHIPS
                                       
   
   
   The type of serial chip (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter -
   UART) in use can make a big difference to comms
   performance/reliability. At higher speed the computer can sometimes
   not service the serial chip fast enough to catch all of the characters
   arriving down the line. This problem increases if running under a
   multi-tasker such as Windows, certain memory managers and other TSRs.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
                                  8. SPEED
                                       
   
   
   Close to every modem user's heart is the speed at which they can
   operate. There are two different speeds: the first is the speed at
   which a modem can talk to another modem; the second is the speed at
   which the modem can talk to its controlling computer (the DTE rate).
   
   Firstly, we will discuss the connect rate. A V.22bis modem can connect
   at a speed of 2,400 bits per second. There are 8 bits in a byte (a
   byte is usually one character) so that is a maximum of 300 characters
   per second (cps). Due to start and stop bits, each byte will take 10
   bits reducing the speed to 240 characters per second. When running
   over IP there is a slight overhead and so you will never see this
   maximum. However, as you can (and will) have several things happening
   at once, you will be able to make very good use of your available
   bandwidth.
   
   The fastest connect rate currently possible is 28,800 bits per second
   (V34). For modems to negotiate at this speed requires a good quality
   phone line, and a modem at each end that is capable of the V34
   protocols. Demon are in the process of upgrading all its modems to V34
   capable modems.
   
   Many modems have compression protocols built in to them. MNP/4 and V42
   use synchronous connections to provide an error free connection
   between modems, saving the start and stop bits. This gives at least a
   20% increase in throughput. V42bis adds compression, provided that the
   DTE rate is higher than the connection rate. This means that when
   downloading a plain text (or ASCII) file, it is possible to get faster
   speeds by compressing the data. The data is compressed so that the
   same information can be encoded in to a smaller space. The receiving
   modem will of course unscramble the data for you. If news normally
   flows in at say 200 cps, then, on a 2400 cps link, you have up to 44
   cps left at the same time for mail, telnet'ing, ftp'ing etc.
   Compression techniques do not work as effectively on binary files and
   make very little difference to pre compressed files (such as .zip,
   .zoo, .lha, .gif etc.).
   
   Note that MNP5 will usually degrade throughput on an IP link due to
   the packet based nature of it's compression method. V42bis does not
   suffer this problem as it is capable of optimising itself dependent on
   the type of data being transferred.
   
   Now we will discuss the second speed - the speed at which the modem
   and computer communicate with each other. This is called the Data
   Terminal Equipment (DTE) rate. If you have a slow modem, e.g. a 2400
   baud one without MNP or V42, then it will probably only work correctly
   when talked to by the computer at the same speed. For the facts on
   your particular modem and computer you should refer to your manuals.
   On faster modems you will only be able to take advantage of some of
   the compression features by making the computer talk to the modem at a
   faster speed than modem is talking to the remote modem down the
   telephone line. Thus you should talk to a 9600 modem at 19200 or even
   38400. You should check the maximum speed at which the serial port on
   your modem can talk and then set your communication package to work at
   the highest mutually available speed. Don't forget that without a
   buffered UART you are unlikely to sustain reliable high speed comms
   above 9600 baud. Modems normally will not negotiate modem to modem
   connect speed higher than the DTE rate - You won't get maximum
   throughput on a fast modem if the computer cannot communicate
   efficiently at a high speed.
   
   Please note that we only support modems capable of V22bis (2400) and
   upwards. If you have a US Robotics/Miracom HST modem, you may not get
   very good throughput in HST mode. In practice HST mode is fine if
   FTP'ing from a site without anything else happening (sending mail
   etc.) as it works fine in one direction at a time only.
   
                             9. TROUBLE SHOOTING
                                       
   
   
   If you are getting garbled characters on the screen then something is
   wrong! Garbled characters are often a sign of mismatched speeds, lack
   of handshaking or a non-locked DTE rate. If you get as far as the
   login prompt but no further then make sure that your dialer script is
   working on 8 bit standard comms: 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit. See
   /pub/doc/Demon.txt for the full logon script details.
   
   Having checked your setup according to the information above, try
   reducing the speed at which the computer talks to the modem (if using
   a high speed modem) until the connection works. If you have to do this
   then either you are attempting to drive your computer or your modem at
   too high a speed, or you have other processes running which interfere
   with the correct running of your serial communications (as per Serial
   Chips above).
   
   If you have finished your live session and log off you may sometimes
   find that your phone line is not dropped. This can result in an
   unwelcome phone bill! There are a number of computer/software specific
   solutions to this problem and some answers are given in
   /pub/doc/Support.faq which may have been included in your
   installation. One thing to check on your modem is that the setting
   that makes the phone line drop when the computer tells the modem that
   it has finished, is on. The computer uses the serial port and drops
   DTR (Data Terminal Ready) and the modem spots this and hangs up the
   line. The setting often &D2 and you should read the section below
   which tells you how to set this. It is definitely &D2 for US Robotics,
   SupraFax and Dowty Quattro modems.
   
   If your modem sometimes seems to fail to recognise a ringing tone,
   reporting it as BUSY. This can be cured by adding a comma after the
   dial number, e.g. "ATDT0813434848,". This makes the modem pause and
   ignore the first rings which it sometimes things is a busy single.
   Some US Robotics modems can exhibit this problem.
   
   ATZ is the command that resets the modem. Setting your initialisation
   string to ATZA0 etc. where A0 is the initialisation string is very
   likely to fail. This is because the modem takes a while to reset and
   throws away the data being sent to it in the meantime. Some people beg
   to differ on this point. However it is certainly true on US Robotics
   modems.
   
   Just to confuse matters further there are often some switches on the
   modem which you can use to make further settings or to default to
   different options. These are referred to as DIP switches. Mostly, the
   advice contained in this document, refers to modems that have not had
   their switches tampered with. If you have the manual for your modem
   (and I hope you have!) then that will probably tell you what the
   default factory switch settings were. Make a careful note of the
   current settings and then change back to the factory defaults. If you
   already use your modem with other packages, make sure they still work.
   These DIP switches must be set to ensure that the reset command ATZ
   resets the modem to the stored values. On some modems it is possible
   to make ATZ restore to factory settings which rather defeats the
   object of configuring it! Some modems have ATY commands instead of DIP
   switches and so it is important that the correct ATY command has been
   used. Fortunately, the default will be OK if no ATY command has been
   issued.
   
   If you are getting a no response from the modem before dialing (e.g.
   The dialer in KA9Q reporting "INPUT LINE WAIT 3000 OK") then that
   means that either your modem is not connected properly (check the
   cables, or for internal modems, check jumper settings, and check
   software configuration to check that the dialer is trying to talk to
   the modem on the correct port), or your modem is not configured for
   verbal result codes. Normally the command to accomplish this is ATV1 .
   
   
   If the modem starts negotiating and starts whistling (especially with
   a 2400 connection)
   
   dial vPoP with &G2 (UK guard tone)
   
   Modem drops line after 1 second
   
   Modem could be set for non-full duplex
   
   There is a section below which specifically refers to problems that
   may be encountered by PC users.

                       10. SOFTWARE AND OTHER FACTORS
                                       
   
   
   By configuring your software correctly you can make significant
   improvements to an under performing communications connection. Things
   to check for include badly fragmented disks (run a disk de-fragmenter
   such as Norton's Speed Disk), no disk cache, no or insufficient
   buffering inside the software and unnecessary checking protocols or
   indexing taking place. Refer to your software's instructions for
   details on these.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
                       11. HELP FOR SPECIFIC COMPUTERS
                                       
   
   
   Some extra comments for some operating systems which may be of use
   follows.
   
IBM PC Compatibles running DOS

   
   
   In addition to the above information there is some specific advice
   below for those of you running DOS.
   
   Some modems send back "OK" when sent ATZ (the reset command) even
   though they are not ready. This means that the dialer program will try
   to ring out even though the modem is not ready. The effect is that you
   will see ATZ on the screen followed by OK and then the program will
   not dial. Eventually it will time out. To avoid this, send AT instead
   of ATZ in the modem initialisation string.
   
   Extended memory drivers can interfere with the correct operation of
   your serial communications. If you suspect this, rename your
   CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files and then reboot your computer to see
   if the connection improves.
   
   If you have a V.32bis 14,400 modem you will probably want to talk to
   it at 38,400. Unless you have a suitable serial chip then you will get
   errors and, as explained at the start of this document, this can
   seriously impact the throughput. When running NET.EXE you can type
   asystat at the net> prompt and information about your serial comms
   will be printed to the screen. The interesting parameter is the third
   one on the second line, 'hw over'. This shows how many hardware
   overruns (characters lost because they weren't fetched from the serial
   chip in time) have occurred. These overruns are usually due to lack of
   either a buffered UART or hardware handshaking.
   
   As already stated, for maximum performance you will need to have a
   buffered chip. For this you will need a 16550A - this is the number
   that is written on the chip. The asystat command at the net prompt
   will tell you if a 16550 is detected. Unfortunately, even top
   manufacturers overlook this area so it is quite likely that your chip
   is below par.
   
   If in doubt, open up your computer and locate the serial chip. If it
   is not a 16550 then it might need replacing. If you are handy with a
   soldering iron you could replace it, but this is not advisable unless
   you are really confident. If the chip is socketed then it can be
   removed and a 16550 (costing about GBP 16 - we sell them) be put in its
   place. If not then you could buy an extra serial card with a 16550
   already on it costing from around GBP 30 to GBP 70 depending on the
   specification.
   
   Some internal modems use a 16450 with a large buffer (1K) and this may
   be enough to stop hardware overruns.
   
   If you are using a standard serial port then the settings offered for
   COM1, 2, 3 or 4 in the configuration program in DIS.EXE will probably
   be fine. Otherwise you should refer to your manuals and enter the
   appropriate IRQ number and I/O base address.
   
   If you install an extra serial card then be aware that if you have,
   for example, a mouse on COM1 then you should not use COM3 for your
   modem using the default IRQ setting as they share the same interrupt.
   
   There is another factor that can impede throughput and that is
   software overruns. Using the NET.EXE software, at the net> prompt
   having just received some news or ftp'd a file, type asystat and look
   at the figure before sw over. If this is not 0 then you are getting
   software overruns. To fix this, increase the buffer size in the attach
   line near the top of autoexec.net:
   
   attach asy 0x3f8 4 ppp sl0 4096 1500 38400
   
   Alter the 4096 in the above to be 8192, 12288 or higher until the
   software overruns are cured.
   
   More information on tuning is available in /pub/doc/ka9q/Tuning.faq.
   
Windows 3.1 / 3.11

   
   
   Windows 3.1 has got drivers that support the 16550A buffered serial
   port, however, some software (Delrina WinFAX) installations, for no
   particular reason, disable the buffering on it If you have a buffered
   serial port, check that in your system.ini file that in the [386Enh]
   section, COMxFIFO=1, where x is the number of your serial port with
   the modem.
   
OS/2

   
   
   If intending to run the DIS DOS software in an OS/2 2.x DOS session
   you should get a copy of sio126c.exe and install the communications
   driver in it before running DIS. sio126c.zip is available on our ftp
   server or via our guest download account. This is because the standard
   communications drivers do not pass to DOS the buffering of your 16550A
   buffered serial chip.
   
Windows NT

   
   
   Windows NT's Remote Access Service (in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
   above) has built-in support for a wide range of modems, if your modem
   is on the list of supported models, you should select that model. If
   it doesn't appear to be supported, you should refer to the windows NT
   help file rasphone.hlp, which should be somewhere on your hard disk.
   If you cannot get any joy yourself, contact either your modem
   manufacturer or Microsoft for an updated modem.inf file that includes
   your specific modem.
   
Macintosh

   
   
   Be aware that many modem cables sold for the Macintosh do not support
   full RTS/CTS hardware flow control.
   
   Many modems do not respond properly if the Macintosh to modem serial
   rate is set to 14400, if you encounter this, try setting the port
   speed to 19200.
   
   Fax extensions that are loaded in the systems extensions folder will
   lock the modem port such that MacPPP cannot access the port; if you
   find ConfigPPP waiting for "OK" then try disabling any fax extensions.
   
                        12. INDIVIDUAL MODEM SETTINGS
                                       
12.1 Setting up a kind of modem not described below

   
   
   To change the settings of your modem, use a program that can talk
   directly to the modem, such as a standard communications package.
   
   (*) In Windows, you can use Terminal (in the Accessories Group),
   setting it for the correct connector (COM Port).
   
   (*) On the Macintosh, you can use ConfigPPP by switching Terminal
   Window on, and clicking Open. When you are finished, switch off
   Terminal Window again. Note that you will not see a text cursor in the
   terminal window.
   
   Type the reset command, usually ATZ <RETURN>, and see the response OK.
   Then continue through the list of settings. You can type ATI4 <RETURN>
   or AT&V <RETURN> to see what your current settings are on a lot of
   modems. For connecting to Demon we recommend the following:
     * Use V.32bis modulation/CCITT protocols rather than HST
     * Originator mode (i.e. Your modem makes the call)
     * Local echo ON
     * Duplex OFF; receiving system sends duplicate data
     * All result codes displayed
     * Display result codes in verbal (not numerical) mode, e.g. OK not 0
     * Enable additional error control indicator, e.g. LAPM/V42BIS
     * Serial port remains at fixed setting
     * Modem send CD (Carrier Detect) on connection
     * Terminal sends DTR (Data Terminal Ready)
     * Data Set Ready (DSR) controlled by the computer
     * Hardware CTS (Clear to Send) transmit data flow control
     * Received Data hardware (RTS) flow controlled by computer
     * Received Data software flow control disabled (make sure the modem
       uses hardware flow control, and switch off XON/XOFF flow control,
       also known as software flow control)
     * MNP 5 data compression disabled
     * Variable link speed negotiation
     * 1800Hz UK guard tone on. (Probably AT&G2)
       
   
   
   When done, type the command that saves the settings to Non Volatile
   Ram (NVRAM) (usually AT&W) so that they are remembered when the modem
   is reset.
   
12.2 Setting Up a US Robotics/Miracom Modem

   
   
   To set up your modem, use a standard communications package. Type ATZ
   <RETURN> and see the response OK. Then continue to make the settings.
   You can type ATI4 <RETURN> and ati5 to see what your current settings
   are.
   
   If you are using a US Robotics modem other than one listed below, try
   the configuration for the Courier, issuing the commands one at a time
   to find out which ones are accepted.
   
   e.g. type AT&K3 <RETURN>. When done type AT&W <RETURN> to save the
   settings to Non Volatile Ram (NVRAM) so that they are remembered when
   the modem is reset.
   
   Some US Robotics occasionally mistake a System X (and Y?) ringing tone
   for a busy tone and hang up just as the Demon end answers. Sticking a
   pause on the end of the dialing sequence stops the modem's response
   long enough for the Demon end to start its negotiating sequence. This
   means that the confusing System X tone is ignored. If the Demon end is
   busy you just to wait a bit longer for the BUSY string, but not as
   long as the setting in S7. Add a pause by adding a comma to the end of
   the string.
   
   If after trying out these settings you still encounter problems, note
   that some USR v34 modems have problems when connecting to some V.FC
   modems and random dropping of carriers. USR has issued a new flash ROM
   for Couriers (dated 12/02/94) and is making a new ROM chip for the
   Sportsers (availability date unknown). Contact USR for details.

12.10 Hayes / Boca modems

   
   
   Note: The term "Hayes compatible" has been completely overused. It
   originally meant the Hayes Smartmodem, launched in the early 80's,
   which was the first to offer an "AT" command set. Since the
   introduction of higher speeds than 1200 baud, compression and error
   correction, extra commands have been needed in the command sets of
   modems, and almost every modem manufacturer has taken to implementing
   them slightly differently.
   
   Boca have recently taken over Hayes and now use the Hayes brand name
   on both the existing Hayes modems and on Boca modems.
   
   This section is specifically for the Hayes Accura 28.8 VFast modem.

   This one isn't really a modem as such (merely a data adaptor, the
   modem is at the Mobile Switching Centre), but worth a mention, it
   doesn't offer any form of data compression, but is useful if you're on
   the road and need to connect. Make sure that the keyguard is not
   active before trying to use it.
   
   Tested on Cellnet GSM and Orange networks, it's a PCMCIA card that

12.14 Racal

   
   
   From a user:
   
   My modem is a model Racal Maxam V 9600 baud, about 2 years old.I have
   been told that a Racal connected to a US Robotics the Racal can detect
   a higher baud carrier as its own 9600 carrier. When connected you will
   get lots of 8 bit characters and the modem will then drop the line.
   This can be solved by forcing the modem to 9600 and not checking for
   errors at this baud rate.
   
   The command string is AT N0 F8 &E0 &W0 for a Racal:
   
   N0 - Do not seek the baud rate
   F8 - Force baud to 9600
   &E0 - No error check
   &W0 - Write change
   
12.15 Rockwell chipset modems

   
   
   Rockwell chipsets are used in a variety of modems, including Supra,
   SmartOne, Cardinal, BestData, SMART, Apex, ComOne
   
   Important note regarding the "RPI" chipset:
   
   Rockwell have released upon modem manufacturers a cut-down version of
   their usual modem chipset, these "RPI chipset" modems do not offer
   error correction or compression in the modem itself, but instead rely
   on a software driver (availability as yet unknown) to perform these
   functions. If you are using a RPI chipset, and do not have the
   appropriate software driver (consult your modem manufacturer), you
   will be unable to take advantage of modem compression of the data.
   
   Here's the generic codes for Rockwell chipsets, your modem may vary
   (See below for specific modems)

B0   v32bis modulation
E1   Local echo on
F0   Variable modem-to-modem speed negotiation
Q0   Modem sends responses
V1   Word response for errors
&K3  RTS/CTS Hardware handshaking
&S1  DSR not forced on
%C3  Compression on (V.42bis)

   
   
   There is an "undocumented" feature present in the Supra V.32/V.32bis
   FAX Modems that can help improve the quality of FAX and Data
   transmissions.
   
   The AT\E1 command is not documented in Supra's manuals, but is present
   in the Rockwell V.32/V.32bis firmware/chipsets on which the Supra
   V.32/V.32bis FAX Modems are based. This command is documented in the
   RC96AC and RC144AC Modem Designer's Guide from Rockwell International.

   winsock (SLIP). The settings enable 14400 BPS with V42 error
   correction and V42bis data compression. In operation I achieve 2600
   cps when obtaining mainly text news. Whilst I am sure the settings
   work I do not vouch for the accuracy of my interpretation of what they
   mean!!

12.16 Tricom

   
   
   From a user:
   
   I'm using a Tricom Pearl 144 from both an IBM Thinkpad and an Acorn
   RiscPC.
   
   I find that the initialisation string
   
   AT&F&C1&D2M1L3S0=0
   
   works reliably

&F       factory setting
&C1 &D2  carrier detect and DSR as with other modems
M1 L3    loud speaker monitoring (feeble speaker & I'm rather deaf!)
S0=0     suppress auto answer

   
   
   Because this starts from the factory setting, it ought to be
   applicable however oddly the modem is set up.
   
   Note that on the Tricom, the Z command terminates any command string,
   so ATZS\ will *not* report the configuration.

12.18 Zoltrix

   
   
   These are one of our user's settings for a Zoltrix v32bis internal
   fax/modem. He writes:
   
   With X4, W1 and V1, I've managed to configure it very nicely to
   re-dial if the line's are busy after only 5 seconds, report CONNECT,
   PROTOCOL CARRIER, and BUSY
   
   The only bit I'm vaguely unsure about is, whether disabling
   compression (%c0 on mine), disables V42bis also, as I really only want
   to knock out MNP 5. &Q9 I think attempts V42bis, falls back to
   LAP-M+v42, then to normal.
   
   An annoying feature is that at&v only digs out probably a quarter of
   the settings - the '\' and '%' commands don't feature; some of them
   appear extremely useful: %Q for instance purportedly reports line
   signal quality, and %L received signal level, which I reckon might be
   relevant to one recent spate of postings, and you can tune up V42bis
   with others.
   
   S86 stores a connection failure cause code.

&Q5       set error correction mode
          causes the modem to try V42bis, then MNP5, then normal
          connection
S48=7     enable V42 negotiation
S46=138   error correction with compression
S95=46    display extended result codes
          so I can see that I've got error correction
          and compression :-)

   
   
   I also have a line
   
   echo atz > com3:
   
   in my demon.bat file to reset my modem as my fax software leaves it in
   a bit of a state :-( Two 'init' lines don't seem to work (not that I'm
   bothered!)
   
   Yet another user writes:
   
   This might be helpful if anyone calls using a
   
   Zoltrix 28800/ Internal / Fax.
   
   Setup straight from box, using a comms package.
   
   Using factory settings,

AT&F    Factory settings
S7=20   then alter s7 to = 20   ATS7=20
B0      then alter b1 to b0
&Q5     then alter &q6 to &q5
optional  ATL1 to ATL2  ATL2 - modem volume to hear connect.

   
   
   and then write these to the stored profiles

AT&W0
AT&W1

   
   
   Zoltrix VFast modems can work at 28,800 with our USRobotics V34 modems
   which we have started installing.
   
   And from yet another user:
   
   If the Zoltrix 28.8 you have is the same as mine - Rockwell WS-281412
   Internal or a WS-2814EM2 then try either of the following init
   strings...

AT&FE1Q0V1X4&C1&D2&K3&R0\N3S0=0

   
   
   Works well in Trumpet and Turnpike - allows FoneCost to track DCD and
   give an accurate log of billing only in trumpet though - usually gives
   between 24000 and 28800 carrier. You can add speaker volume bits as
   required.

AT&F0B0L3W1X4+MS=11,1,14400,28800

   
   
   Short & sweet - forces between 14400 & 28800 carrier with V42
   correction
   
   One thing to watch for is making sure that &F or &F0 is the first
   command ( to reset to factory) as the fax leaves the modem in a state,
   usually with RTS/CTS left off and XON\XOFF on!
   
   Being a US modem it doesn't seem to recognise the Busy state - I'm
   sure there's a way to force it but I've still to find it :-( If anyone
   out there has any ideas it would be great to be able to get away from
   manual redials or waiting until the line drops.
   
12.19 Zyxel

   
   
   From one of our users again:
   
   The following "dial_cmd" is for a Zyxel U-1496E+ modem

"ATL2N1X7&G2*E1DT"
L2     sets a low (but not inaudible) speaker volume
N1     sets a low (but not inaudible) ringing volume
X7     sets result code options so that the "connect" message is, for example,
"CONNECT 14400/Arq/V42b"
&G2    enables 1800 Hz guard tone
*E1    terminate call if error control negotiation fails, i.e. insist on error-
control or end call
DT     dial using DTMF tones

                                 13. TESTING
                                       
   
   
   To test out your setup you could try using ping. ping gate.demon.co.uk
   whilst logged on directly to London or a vPoP should return a speed of
   about 270ms on a fast link down to 1000ms on a slow link.
   
   Try using ftp to ftp.demon.co.uk and downloading files from /pub/test.
   There are files of varying contents that have also been compressed in
   various ways. "empty" files are there so that you can test the maximum
   throughput on blank data. "full" files contain a thorough mix of
   characters and so little compression by your modem will be possible.
   "regular" files are a mixture - just like this document or a Usenet
   news message. Each of these three have been compressed using popular
   methods and so you can try working on the compressed files as well if
   you like. Try uploading these files to ftp.demon.co.uk:/incoming to
   test the link in that direction as well.
   
   Using a V.32bis modem, the maximum throughput you are likely to get on
   a binary file is 1,600 cps. On an ASCII file the maximum is about
   2,800 cps.

   Many thanks to the users who have helped to gather up much of this
   information, often from poorly written manuals, and to John Navas for
   his excellent high speed modem FAQ, available on the world wide web: .
