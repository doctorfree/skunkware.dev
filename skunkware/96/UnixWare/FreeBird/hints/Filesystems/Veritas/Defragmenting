After a while, the performance of your hard disk may deteriorate.  This is
because the disk is getting fragmented.

If you have the advanced veritas package you can run this script once a week to
keep your disk in good condition (run from cron) :-

#!/bin/sh
#
# script to defragment
#
if [ -f /etc/fs/vxfs/fsadm ]
then
  FSADM=/etc/fs/vxfs/fsadm
else
  FSADM=/usr/sbin/fsadm
fi

outfile=/usr/spool/fsadm/out.`/bin/date +'%m%d'`
for i in `/etc/mount -v | grep "type vxfs" | cut -f3 -d\ `
do
  /bin/echo "Reorganizing $i"
  /bin/timex $FSADM -e -E -s $i
  /bin/timex $FSADM -d -D $i
done > $outfile 2>&1
