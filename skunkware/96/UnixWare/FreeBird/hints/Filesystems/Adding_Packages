Ever got a situation where you can't add a new package because you
havn't got enough blocks in the right place?

For example, I have just tried installing a new package - almost everything
goes into /usr/package (yes, I know it should go into /opt but this isn't a
well designed package).  I discovered that since I like a seperate partition
for /usr the installation reported not enought free blocks.

Since I had plenty in the root partition I put a symbolic link in
(mkdir /package; ln -s /package /usr/package).  But still the package 
fails to install!

It is possible to turn off the space checking (and many other package 
install features) - be warned!  If you do turn off these features you could
well be creating a lot of problems for yourself - make sure your package
does actually fit in the available space!

i)	Create a file /var/sadm/install/admin/nocheck thus

#ident  "@(#)/var/sadm/install/admin/default.sl 1.1 1.0 11/02/92 12095 Univel#ident  "$Header: $"
instance=overwrite
partial=nocheck
runlevel=nocheck
idepend=quit
rdepend=quit
space=nocheck
setuid=nocheck
conflict=nocheck
action=nocheck
basedir=default
mail=root

(you can edit the fields as appropriate)

ii)	Do a pkgadd thus :-

pkgadd -anocheck -dctape1
