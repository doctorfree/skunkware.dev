notes on WordPerfect 5.1
------------------------

Again, We've packaged WordPerfect into a SVR4.2 style package for ease of
re-installation.

No real install problems - it does take a long time to get right however.  I
suggest that after loading from floppy the whole directory is saved off to
tape (before running the install scripts).  This makes it a lot easier to
re-run the install scripts.

Printer configuration is a pain.  Always choose "Other Spooler".

I've included a pop-up menu selection to "install files" (see the class
database).  This makes various subdirectories which I use.  I've included
my printer configuration files for you to look at as well.

Here are the skeleton packages.
