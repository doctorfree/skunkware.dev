			Application Notes
			-----------------

At USLE we tend to spend some time with a new application to get
it working and then put it into a SVR4.2 package.  This way the
application can be installed on other machines quickly and
also across the network.

These notes consist of a package tree (but without the actual binaries!).

You will be able to tell from the pkgmap file where the application
binaries are kept.

You may want to either steal class databases, icons etc from these trees
or use them to create your own package.

See the development notes on how to create packages.
