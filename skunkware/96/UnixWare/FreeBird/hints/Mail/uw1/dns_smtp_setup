ISSUE

The following issue describes how to configure Primary Domain Name Server on 
UnixWare 1.1 that is configured with two secondary name servers, and is the 
SMTP mail gateway to the internet.  The configuration files listed in this 
issue reflects an actual customer "working model".

IS CONFIGURATION

Primary Name Server hostname = uwphost
Domain name = primedom.com
Internet address = 137.65.127.1
Information Provider = linkup.net
Secondary name server = ns1.linkup.net  internet address = 144.220.1.1
Secondary name server = ns2.linkup.net  internet address = 144.220.1.2

-----------------------------------

The next step is to restart the name server by killing the in.named process.  
This process will restart once again and populate the database with the 
new entries.  

Note:  Remember to increment the serial number field of each required file 
in order to propagate all changes to all servers in the domain, otherwise 
the secondary name servers may contain outdated information.

To kill the name server, execute the following command to get the current 
process ID as shown below:

#ps -ef | grep in.named

#kill -1 326

RUNNING NSLOOKUP TO VERIFY DATABASE INTEGRITY

#/usr/sbin/nslookup

Address:  127.0.0.1

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:  uwphost.primedom.com
Address:  137.65.127.1

Note:  The above entry provides the address record as located in 
the /var/named/primedom.hosts.fwd forward file.

>set type=ns
>primedom.com
Server:  uwphost.primedom.com
Address:  127.0.0.1

Non-authoritative answer:
primedom.com  nameserver = UWPHOST.PRIMEDOM.COM
primedom.com  nameserver = NS1.LINKUP.NET
primedom.com  nameserver = NS1.LINKUP.NET

Authoritative answers can be found from:
primedom.COM  nameserver = UWPHOST.PRIMEDOM.COM
primedom.COM  nameserver = NS1.LINKUP.NET
primedom.COM  nameserver = NS1.LINKUP.NET
UWPHOST.PRIMEDOM.COM  internet address = 137.65.127.1
NS1.LINKUP.NET  internet address = 144.220.1.1
NS2.LINKUP.NET  internet address = 144.220.1.2

Note:  The above command provides all name servers and their addresses that can
be found who knows about your primary, including the primary domain name server.

>set type=mx
>primedom.com
Server:  uwphost.primedom.com
Address:  127.0.0.1

primedom.com    preference = 10, mail exchanger = uwphost.primedom.com
uwphost.primedom.com  internet address = 137.65.127.1

Note:  The above mail exchange record points to the domain and the primary 
host in the domain.  If this entry returns the following error message, the 
MX record entry in the forward file is incorrect, or placed in an incorrect 
position of the file:

*** No mail exchanger (MX) record available for primedom.com

Edit the /var/named/primedom.hosts.fwd file and modify the MX record entry.  
Kill the in.named process once again to reload the database.  Execute the 
nslookup command, and re-execute the above steps until an MX record is 
established.

Note:  If an MX record is not established for the domain, and the primary 
host on the domain, incoming and outgoing mail will cease to function.

uwphost.primedom.com  internet address = 137.65.127.1
IC1.ICP.NET  internet address = 144.225.1.1
IC2.ICP.NET  internet address = 144.225.1.2

At this point, email should be operative.  Try sending a test message to the 
primary as shown below:

mail -d sysop@uwphost.primedom.com
Subject:  test primary
 
This is a mail test to sysop@uwphost.primedom.com
.

The delivery command should provide enough information to know whether the mail message was sent.  Check the /var/mail/sysop file for the message.

EMAIL CONFIGURATION:

To send mail messages to sysop@primedom.com or user@domain, it is necessary to 
create a translation entry in /usr/lib/mail/mailsurr.proto.  The user@domain 
entry is shown below from the mailsurr.proto file:

# Map all names of the form user@local-machine -> user
# Map all names of the form user@uname -> user
# Map all names of the form user@domain
# Then loop back through from the top.
#
'.+'  '(.+)@%L'    'Translate R=\\1'
'.+'  '(.+)@%U'    'Translate R=\\1'
'.+'  '(.+)@%d'    'Translate R=\\1'   #This is the added entry for user@domain

In addition to the mailsurr.proto change, the "%d" will need to be 
defined for your domain as shown in the /etc/mail/mailcnfg file:

/etc/mail/mailcnfg:

ADD_FROM=1
%d=primedom.com

Note:  The ADD_FROM=1 entry specifies SMTP to add a From: line to a mail 
message that may not contain it in order to reply to incoming mail messages.  
If a From: line exists, SMTP will NOT add an additional reply line.

SMARTERHOST PROCESSING:

If another host is the mail gateway for all incoming and outgoing mail, 
this gateway host should have a mail exchange record or MX record entry in 
the DNS hosts or forward file.  This gateway host contains all the alias 
records for the distribution of mail messages to all hosts on the local 
network, or domain.  This gateway host is called the SMARTERHOST.  All 
UnixWare clients that are located on the network should be configured to 
route all incoming or outgoing mail through the SMARTERHOST for deliveries, 
and all UnixWare clients may address the mail messages to user@domain 
which allows the SMARTERHOST to process the delivery of all mail messages.

The UnixWare client should be configured with a domain name resolver file 
called /etc/resolv.conf which specifies the domain name and the addresses to 
all nameservers on the domain.  The format of this file is shown in the 
DNS section of this document.  In addition, the only hosts specified in 
the /etc/hosts file is the local client host and the IP address of the 
local client.

The /etc/mail/mailcnfg file should be configured with the SMARTERHOST 
entry as shown below:

/etc/mail/mailcnfg:

SMARTERHOST=gateway.primedom.com
ADD_FROM=1
%d=primedom.com

Once the mail files have been configured, the /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/createSurr 
command is executed to generate a new /etc/mail/mailsurr file that contains 
the SMTP delivery command for SMARTERHOST processing.

Test the mail addressing:

mail -d sysop@primedom.com
Subject:  test mail to user@domain
This is a mail test to sysop@primedom.com
.


NOTE:  UUNET can be configured as a primary domain name server and a 
SMARTERHOST for those sites that utilize the uunet service.

If you are running just SMTP mail, the smtpqer delivery command should be 
the only delivery displayed.  If the uux delivery command is displayed 
in addition to the smtpqer entry, then the /usr/lib/uucp/Systems file, 
by default, has a blank line at the end of the file.

This blank line should be removed because the email autoconfiguration 
process interprets this line as a uucp remote entry and generates a 
UUCP flag in /etc/mail/mailflgs.  As a result, the /etc/mail/mailsurr 
file contains the uux/rmail entry for uucp mail which is not what is wanted 
in this configuration.  Once the Systems file is edited, re-execute
/usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/createSurr to generate/update a new /etc/mail/mailsurr 
file.


SMTP and UUCP EMAIL CONFIGURATION:

Customer configuration is TCP/IP connected to other file servers, a remote 
UUCP connection to an internet provider (PSI), and all electronic mail is 
sent and picked up via uucico using the Basic Networking Utilities.  
All mail is bouncing due to the From line postmark line is being stripped 
from the mail message. 

The mail autoconfiguration routine invoked by /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/createSurr 
consults the perl script /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/configCheck to probe the 
system configuration.  This customer has the tcpset package installed, but 
all email is sent via uucp.  The /etc/mail/mailflgs file contains the 
IP,UUCP, and SMTR flags which generates two delivery commands in 
/etc/mail/mailsurr.  The first delivery command is the smtpqer command,
followed by the uux delivery command.

The problem in this configuration is the smtpqer entry in the 
/etc/mail/mailsurr file.  There contains an I=1; entry on the smtpqer 
entries which indicates to use RFC822 mail format.  RFC822 does NOT expect 
the extra postmark From line, and so strips it.  An example mail header 
processing through both smtpqer and uux delivery command is shown below:

From: root@Novell.COM
Subject: test mail message

test message

NOTE:  You can add more entries to this message header by adding entries to 
the /etc/mail/mailcnfg file.  An example of adding an extra FROM line, 
and DATE line is shown below:

/etc/mail/mailcnfg:

ADD_TO=1
ADD_FROM=1
ADD_DATE=1

resulting mail message:

 From: root@Novell.COM
Subject: test mail message
To: techsupp@Novell.COM
Date: Fri, 29 Apr 1994  17:06 -0600 (MDT)
From: user foo <user@Novell.COM>
Content-Length: 12

test message

The uux mail delivery in this scenario expects an additional From 
line at the beginning of the mail header.  This problem can be resolved in 
two ways:

Solution 1:

Comment out the smtpqer entries in the /usr/lib/mail/mailsurr.proto and 
execute /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/createSurr to eliminate the smtp delivery command.  

Solution 2:

Remove the I=1; entries from the smtpqer lines in the 
/usr/lib/mail/mailsurr.proto and execute /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/createSurr 
to update the /etc/mail/mailsurr file.

Conversely, If a user's system  does not have tcp/ip installed, and they 
wish to have the From line stripped when sending mail via UUCP to say 
an SCO system which only knows RFC822 format, the I=1; would need to be 
prepended to  the uux delivery command lines in the mailsurr.proto file, 
otherwise the mail will bounce because of this postmark line.
An example mail message with the postmark From line is shown below:

>From root Fri Apr 29 17:03 MDT 1994
Received: from gateway by remotehost.Novell.COM Fri, 29 Apr 94 17:03 MDT
Received: from user by remotehost.Novell.COM Fri, 29 Apr 94 17:03 MDT
Subject: test mail message
To: techsupp@Novell.COM
Date: Fri, 29 Apr 1994  17:06 -0600 (MDT)
From: user foo <user@Novell.COM>

test message 

NOTE:  The autoconfiguration process should be smart enough to know that 
when tcpip is installed, it doesn't necessarily indicate that smtp mail is used.

LOGGING:

To turn on logging for incoming and outgoing mail, execute the 
following command:

#/usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/createSurr -l on

The log file can be displayed in /var/mail/:log and /var/mail/:errors 
for any mail errors.

To determine problems with outgoing mail, check the /var/spool/smtpq/LOG file.
Each time a mail message is sent, a log of the delivery command is appended 
to this log file.  A cron entry located in /var/spool/cron/crontabs/smtp 
recycles daily backup copies of the mail message deliveries on a 7 day 
cycle.  This is useful for debugging mail problems.  

OPEN ISSUES:

The mailx command in UnixWare had a problem with the From line when mail is 
sent to a UnixWare host that uses !path addressing vs. @style addressing.  
A workaround is available by specifying the -r option to the in.smtpd 
which tells the SMTP daemon to NOT retranslate any incoming mail address 
so that you don't get the From smtp line when replying to email, and 
the incoming addresses remain the same.  If you want the UnixWare system 
to translate the addresses, then leave the -r option out.  It is standard 
practice to leave it in.

If the From smtp line is being generated on a SCO system  when a user is 
trying to  reply to a  mail message, the problem is not with UnixWare, 
but with the mailx  on the SCO side.  This problem should be addressed 
with the support people at SCO.  We have corrected the problem in our 
mailx command for the next release, and use the -r option as a workaround.

There is a problem with electronic mail either in the SMTP module or 
the /bin/mail module which has not been determined at this time.  
The problem is that mail does not recognize the Errors-To: line in the 
mail header on a "bounced" mail mesage, and favors the "From:" line of 
the mail header causing the mail message to bounce to the wrong address.

The problem was found when the administrator created a world wide 
mailing list for redistribution, and a mail message bounced to everyone 
on the mailing list instead of back to the mail administrator.

A modification report has been filed, and the problem is currently under 
investigation.  At this point, a correction is not available.  An updated 
TID will be generated, once a status update can be obtained

DEBUGGING:

To determine whether a problem can be isolated to the address translation, 
use the -T option to the mail command as shown below:

mail -T /etc/mail/mailsurr sysop@primedom.com > /tmp/mailsurr.out

View the /tmp/mailsurr.out log file to determine whether the address 
is improperly translated.  This command will not send a mail message, 
but is used to determine the integrity of the mailsurr file.

All outgoing mail messages for SMTP are located in /var/spool/smtpq 
under the domain/host directories.

If a mail message is bouncing back with problems with the From header 
line or missing the postmark line, it may be necessary to edit 
the mailsurr.proto file and either insert or
remove the I=1; field of the smtpqer delivery command line 
entries as shown below:


<IP&&!DNS&&!(SMTR&&STUP)>  '.+'  '([^@,:]+)@(.+)'  '< I=1;B=4096; smtpqer -N -u %R \\2' '\\1@\\2'
<IP&&!DNS&&!(SMTR&&STUP)>  '.+'  '@([^@,:]+)[,:](.+)'  '< I=1;B=4096; smtpqer -N -u %R \\1' '\\2'
<IP&&!DNS&&SMTR&&STUP>  '.+'  '([^@,:]+)@(.+)'  '< I=1;B=4096; smtpqer -N -u %R %X' '\\1@\\2'
<IP&&!DNS&&SMTR&&STUP>  '.+'  '(@[^@,:]+[,:].+)'  '< I=1;B=4096; smtpqer -N -u %R %X' '\\1'
<IP&&DNS&&!(SMTR&&STUP)>  '.+'  '([^@,:]+)@(.+)'  '< I=1;B=4096; smtpqer -u %R \\2' '\\1@\\2'
<IP&&DNS&&!(SMTR&&STUP)>  '.+'  '@([^@,:]+)[,:](.+)'  '< I=1;B=4096; smtpqer -u %R \\1' '\\2'
<IP&&DNS&&SMTR&&STUP>  '.+'  '([^@,:]+)@(.+)'  '< I=1;B=4096; smtpqer -u %R %X' '\\1@\\2'
<IP&&DNS&&SMTR&&STUP>  '.+'  '(@[^@,:]+[,:].+)'  '< I=1;B=4096; smtpqer -u %R %X' '\\1'

In cases where internet mail is coming in, and forwarded out via uucp, 
the I=1; field must be removed, otherwise the From line containing the 
user name and date will be stripped prior to sending the message off via 
uucp or uux.

NOTE:  It is advisable to remove the -B option of the smtpqer entries in the 
mailsurr.proto file to eliminate the need for batch processing.

Execute /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/createSurr to update the /etc/mail/mailsurr 
file and re-test the mail once again.
