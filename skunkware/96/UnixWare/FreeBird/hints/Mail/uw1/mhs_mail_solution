ISSUE
The following issue describes how to workaround problems that are 
associated with the UnixWare 1.1 MHS mail gateway.  All problems have been 
corrected in a future update release for UnixWare 1.1.  If the following 
areas marked for change have not been updated at the time of this issue, 
please correct the problems and update the mail files to provide a 
temporary resolution until an update has been released.

Problem 1:

If incoming SMTP (Internet) mail messages are to be routed through the 
UnixWare 1.1 MHS gateway, the following files should be corrected:

After you have installed TCP/IP, you must correct a configuration file 
for mail addressing to work properly.  Open a Terminal window, type su and 
the root password, and open the /etc/inetd.conf file with your favorite editor.
Next, change the smtp entry near the end of the file to add the -r option.  
The new entry should read as follows:

smtp stream tcp nowait root /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/in.smtpd in.smtpd -H sys -r 
(where sys is replaced by your system name).

When mail comes into the UnixWare host, it comes in via in.smtpd.  The -r 
option tells the incoming SMTP mail daemon to NOT retranslate the mail 
address of incoming mail, and to process it as RFC822 format which follows 
spec.  Without the -r option, mail headers will be re-processed improperly, 
and you will experience mail routing issues.

Once the change has been saved, send a SIGHUP to the daemon in order to 
reread the inetd.conf configuration file for the change to be active as 
shown below:

#ps -ef | grep in.smtpd
( note the process id number of the process.  (PID)
#kill -HUP <PID>

Problem 2:

A problem occurs when incoming mail is routed through the MHS gateway 
addressed to user@domain.  The mail message does not arrive on the 
MHS gateway system.  This problem is associated with some syntax errors 
in the smf delivery command located in the /usr/lib/mail/mailsurr.proto 
file on lines 80 and 82.  The lines in question are shown below. Please 
note the syntax error to user@domain is %R@1D which is incorrect:

(NOTE LINE 80->)<MHS>  '[^@]+'  '([^@,:]+)@%g'    '< B=4096; /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/smfqueue -h 0 -r %R@1D ' '\\1@%g%D'
<MHS>  '.+'  '([^@,:]+)@%g'    '< B=4096; /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/smfqueue -h 0 -r %R ' '\\1@%g%D'
(NOTE LINE 82->)<MHS>  '[^@]+'  '([^@,:]+)@(.+).%g%D'  '< B=4096; /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/smfqueue -h 0 -r %R@1D ' '\\1@\\2.%g%D'
<MHS>  '.+'  '([^@,:]+)@(.+).%g%D'  '< B=4096; /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/smfqueue -h 0 -r %R ' '\\1@\\2.%g%D'
<MHS>  '.+'  '([^@,:]+)@(.+).%g'  '< B=4096; /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/smfqueue -h 0 -r %R ' '\\1@\\2.%g%D'

The corrected entries should read as follows:

<MHS>  '[^@]+'  '([^@,:]+)@%g'    '< B=4096; 
/usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/smfqueue -h 0 -r %R@%U%D ' '\\1@%g%D'
<MHS>  '.+'  '([^@,:]+)@%g'    '< B=4096; /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/smfqueue -h 0 -r %R ' '\\1@%g%D'
<MHS>  '[^@]+'  '([^@,:]+)@(.+).%g%D'  '< B=4096; /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/smfqueue -h 0 -r %R@%U%D ' '\\1@\\2.%g%D'
<MHS>  '.+'  '([^@,:]+)@(.+).%g%D'  '< B=4096; /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/smfqueue -h 0 -r %R ' '\\1@\\2.%g%D'
<MHS>  '.+'  '([^@,:]+)@(.+).%g'  '< B=4096; /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/smfqueue -h 0 -r %R ' '\\1@\\2.%g%D'

The %R@1D is replaced with %R@%U%D denoting the machine and domain.

Problem 3:

If Domain Name Service is used in a mail environment, the /etc/resolv.conf 
file is configured on the UnixWare host to resolve name to address mapping.  
The MHS configuration utilities parse this file to derive the domain name.  
However, there is a syntax error in the /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/getDomain 
Perl script that causes incorrect parsing of this file when multiple 
tabs or space are inserted between the word "domain" and the domain name.

The entry in this file is shown below:

if (/^ domain (.+)/i) {printf "%s", $1; exit 0;}

Edit this entry, and insert the following correction to parse out spaces 
and tabs to extract the domain name properly:

if (/^ domain\s+(.+)/i) {printf "%s", $1; exit 0;}

Problem 4:

At the time of installation of UnixWare 1.1, the smfsched process used to 
schedule the MHS mail messages may not be set with the appropriate privileges.
This problem results in the ability to receive mail, but no ability to 
send mail.  To determine whether the priviledges should be set, execute 
the following command as the super user:

#/usr/sbin/initprivs

If the smfsched process is returned invalid, execute the following command:

#filepriv -f setuid /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/smfsched

In addition to the above mentioned correction, the smtp scheduler may also 
require updated file priviledges by executing the following commands:

#filepriv -f setuid /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/smtpsched
#filepriv -f setplevel /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/smtploop

Problem 5:

Ensure that the system has two different smf-out files located in the mail 
directory.  There has been problems with customers removing the 
/usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/smf-out executable with the thought that this file 
is already located in the /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/suid/smf-out directory.  
These two files are not the same, and should not be deleted from the 
UnixWare host.  If one or both of the entries are removed, the MHS gateway 
will not work properly, and the file will need to be re-installed on the 
UnixWare host.  The /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/smf-out file is an ELF 
executable file whereas the /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/suid/smf-out is a 
Perl script.

Problem 6:

If a user encodes a file as an attachment and send it through the gateway, 
the message will bounce stating that the attachment is located in the 
wrong place.  This problem can be corrected by editing the 
/usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/suid/smf-out file and prepending the /usr/sbin 
path to the mknod command.

Problem 7:

The UnixWare 1.1 connectivity to the NetWare mail gateway host is 
not stable on freshly installed 1.1 system.   To determine this problem, 
view the /var/spool/smf/log file periodically to see if a No working 
directory error message or Cannot open netdir.tab error message has been 
encountered. To correct the problem until a final resolution is provided, 
edit the following files:

/usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/smf-poll

Search for the following line entry:

$gatedir="$MV/mhs/mail/gates/$mhsGW";

Add the following two lines of perl script after the above entry:

system("nwlogout $MAILSERV");
sleep 5;

In addition to the above mentioned changes, search for the following entry 
in the same file:

#0=OK
There should be three entries after the above mentioned entry that 
looks like the following entry:

$_.$$  This entry should be changed to read $_.use.

All changes recorded in problem 7 should be applied to the 
/usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/suid/smf-out file in order to correct 
connectivity issues with MHS.

Problem 8:
If the following error is displayed when sending mail to user@mhs.domain, 
the /etc/mail/Cmailsurr file should be removed.

UX:mail:ERROR: Can't send to user@machine
UX:mail:ERROR: Return to root
UX:mail:ERROR: Unusable address in 'From:' header field

Once the /etc/mail/Cmailsurr file is removed, generate an updated version 
of the Cmailsurr file by executing /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/createSurr.  
This command also generates a new /etc/mail/mailsurr file from the 
/usr/lib/mail/mailsurr.proto file.

Problem 9:

If problems exist sending email to user@domain, the 
/usr/lib/mail/mailsurr.proto file and the /etc/mail/mailcnfg file 
should be edited to include an address translation entry as shown below:

/etc/mail/mailcnfg:

%g=mhs
SMARTERHOST=uwphost.primedom.com
%d=primedom.com

The %d defines the domain name as stated in the /etc/resolv.conf file.  
The address translation entry for user@domain should be added in the 
mailsurr.proto file as shown below:

# Map all names of the form user@local-machine -> user
# Map all names of the form user@uname -> user
# Map all names of the form user#domain
# Then loop back through from the top.
#
'.+'  '(.+)@%L'    'Translate R=\\1'
'.+'  '(.+)@%U'    'Translate R=\\1'
'.+'  '(.+)@%d'    'Translate R=\\1'   #added entry here

Once the entry has been added to the mailsurr.proto file, an update to 
/etc/mail/mailsurr needs to take place by executing 
/usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/createSurr as the super user.

Problem 10:

The MHS_Setup GUI on the desktop is used to set up the MHS gateway 
configuration files.  However, the GUI will accept uppercase characters 
for the gateway system name, but the MHS utilities will fail.  It is 
important to note that all entries configured in the MHS_Setup GUI be in 
lowercase to prevent failures from occuring.
