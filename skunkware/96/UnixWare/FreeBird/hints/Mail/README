This directory contains information, files and utilities
found useful for setting up UnixWare electronic mail 
using the /etc/mail/mailsurr system (not sendmail).  The docs
Below are subdivided into UnixWare 1.x docs and UnixWare 2 docs,
except the first which covers both releases.

	mail.faq - The Email FAQ for mailsurr.

UnixWare 2 relevant material:
	Dynatext docs are available here:

	setup_mail.UW2.ps.Z - Chapter from the System Owner Handbook
	mailserver_admin.UW2.ps.Z - Chapter from the System Admin Guide.

	mailsurr.proto.uw2 - a sample /usr/lib/mail/mailsurr.proto file
	for an email gateway serving both uucp and internet email,
	with routing between the zones using the pathrouter command
	(note pathrouter is now standard in UW2)

	client.mailcnfg.uw2 - a sample mailcnfg file for a client
	machine in a cluster that forwards all mail to a smarterhost

	client.mailsurr.uw2 - a sample mailsurr file for a client machine
	in a cluster that forwards all mail to a smarterhost

UnixWare 1.x relevant material located in the uw1 directory:

	dns_smtp_setup: DNS/Email a complete solution.
	(you may also want to take a look at hints/Networking/DNS/dns.tar.Z,
         which contains some Perl scripts from O'Reilly to automate
	 DNS configuration file creation).

	mhs_mail_setup: a complete solution to setting up MHS mail

	pathrouter.tar.Z : a smart router for UnixWare with sample
		config files

	mailproto.tar.Z : mail tools for autoconfiguration - provided
	as part of the nuc add-on in UW 1.1 - useful if you have not
	installed the nuc add-on package.

	mailsurr: an example /etc/mail/mailsurr file

	mailcnfg: an example /etc/mail/mailcnfg file

	client.mailsurr: example  /etc/mail/mailsurr for non-smarthost client
	which just forwards mail to a smarterhost (useful for clusters
	of machines)

	client.mailcnfg: example  /etc/mail/mailcnfg for non-smarthost client
	which just forwards mail to a smarterhost (useful for clusters
	of machines)

	mailloggers.shar  - some trivial maillog utilities, that basically

To unwind the tar files, if you have problems try ustar or GNU tar.
