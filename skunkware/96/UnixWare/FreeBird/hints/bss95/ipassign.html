<h1>IP Address Assignment Request Form</h1>
<FORM METHOD=GET ACTION="/cgi-bin/ipassign">
<hr>
This form lets you request automatic assignment or query of a TCP/IP 
address, and bootptab entry (if the network card address field is completed).
The results of this assignment request will be <em>emailed</em> to the
email address you specify below, a typical example is:
<em>Yourfirstname_Yourlastname@groupwise.novell.co.uk</em>
<p>
Email Response to:
<input type="text" name=email" SIZE=42 VALUE="XXXXX@groupwise.novell.co.uk">
<hr>
<p>
Select Command:<select name="s-field">
<option selected>Assign<option>GetEntry<option>Remove</select>
<ul>
<li><em>Assign</em> to request assignment of a new IP
address. 
<li><em>GetEntry</em> to request information on an existing entry.
<li><em>Remove</em> to request removal of an entry (note that this  is not
automatic).
</ul>
<hr>
The local area network is subnetted according to location and in some
cases floors within a location.
<p>Select the network:
<input type="radio" name="net" VALUE="UKB First Floor" CHECKED>UKB 1st Floor
<input type="radio" name="net" VALUE="UKB Second Floor">UKB Second Floor
<input type="radio" name="net" VALUE="UKB Third Floor">UKB Third Floor
<input type="radio" name="net" VALUE="UKB Third Floor Lab"> UKB Third Floor Lab
<input type="radio" name="net" VALUE="UKB Ground Floor"> UKB Ground Floor
<input type="radio" name="net" VALUE="UKW"> UKW
<input type="radio" name="net" VALUE="UKH"> UKH
<p>
<em>Domain Name Service</em> (DNS) is used for TCP/IP addressing.
The Bracknell domain is ukb.novell.com. Weybridge is ukw.novell.com and
Hungerford is ukh.novell.com. The script in use will automatically
add the correct domain based on the network selection. Typical workstation
names are based on the name of the user, for example: <em> auser </em>.
<br>Enter the machine name without the domain:
<input type="text" name="name" SIZE=12>
<p>
Desktop workstations are expected to obtain their IP addressing information
from the <em>bootp server</em>. This requires the hardware address
of the network card, also known as the mac address, for example: <em>
00001b27e123</em>.
<br>Enter the mac address for the network card (12 hex digits):
<input type="text" name="mac" SIZE=12>
<p>
We need to keep a record of contact information for equipment.  For 
workstations this should be the owner name
and possibly a contact phone number separated by spaces, for example:
<em>Firstname Lastname x4087</em>
<br>Enter description:
<input type="text" name=descr" SIZE=32">
