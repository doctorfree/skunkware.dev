                How to run a 2nd desktop on UnixWare 2.x

Document Revision 1.0 

1. Preface

The standard X Windows configuration under UnixWare installs a single X (1) 
server which is managed by xdm (1M) to manage user logins. There are cases 
however when users may wish to have the capability of having  a second desktop for 
developement or testing purposes. This document describes the steps necessary
to achieve this.

2. Backup files to be modified

   cp /usr/X/lib/xdm/Xservers /usr/X/lib/xdm/Xservers.original
   cp /usr/X/lib/xdm/xdm-config /usr/X/lib/xdm/xdm-config.original

3. Necessary changes

Following the procedure to install a second desktop. You will need superuser
privileges for this.

 

 o Modify /usr/X/lib/xdm/Xservers:

   - before - 

    #ident	"@(#)/usr/X/lib/xdm/Xservers.sl 1.1 UW2.0 11/23/94 37433 NOVELL"
    #
    # Xservers file, workstation prototype
    #
    # This file should contain an entry to start the server on the
    # local display; if you have more than one display (not screen),
    # you can add entries to the list (one per line).  If you also
    # have some X terminals connected which do not support XDMCP,
    # you can add them here as well.  Each X terminal line should
    # look like:
    #	XTerminalName:0 foreign
    #
    :0 local /usr/X/bin/X -xnetaccess on 

   - after -

    #ident	"@(#)/usr/X/lib/xdm/Xservers.sl 1.1 UW2.0 11/23/94 37433 NOVELL"
    #
    # Xservers file, workstation prototype
    #
    # This file should contain an entry to start the server on the
    # local display; if you have more than one display (not screen),
    # you can add entries to the list (one per line).  If you also
    # have some X terminals connected which do not support XDMCP,
    # you can add them here as well.  Each X terminal line should
    # look like:
    #	XTerminalName:0 foreign
    #
    :0 local /usr/X/bin/X -xnetaccess on 
    :1 local /usr/X/bin/X :1 -xnetaccess on 

   This starts up a 2nd X server when xdm is brought up by /etc/rc2.d/S69xdm.

 o Modify /usr/X/lib/xdm/xdm-config:

   - before -

    #ident	"@(#)/usr/X/lib/xdm/xdm-config.sl 1.1 UW2.0 11/23/94 34751 NOVELL"
    DisplayManager.companyLogoPixmap:	/usr/X/lib/pixmaps/Nlogo.xpm
    DisplayManager.backgroundPixmap: /usr/X/lib/pixmaps/Npaper.xpm
    DisplayManager.showMnemonic:	1
    DisplayManager.errorLogFile:	/tmp/xdm-errors
    DisplayManager.pidFile:		/dev/X/xdm-pid
    DisplayManager.keyFile:		/usr/X/lib/xdm/xdm-keys
    DisplayManager.servers:		/usr/X/lib/xdm/Xservers
    DisplayManager._0.authorize:	true
    DisplayManager*authComplain:	false
    DisplayManager._0.setup:        /usr/X/lib/xdm/Xsetup_0
    DisplayManager._0.terminateServer:	true

   - after -

    #ident	"@(#)/usr/X/lib/xdm/xdm-config.sl 1.1 UW2.0 11/23/94 34751 NOVELL"
    DisplayManager.companyLogoPixmap:	/usr/X/lib/pixmaps/Nlogo.xpm
    DisplayManager.backgroundPixmap: /usr/X/lib/pixmaps/Npaper.xpm
    DisplayManager.showMnemonic:	1
    DisplayManager.errorLogFile:	/tmp/xdm-errors
    DisplayManager.pidFile:		/dev/X/xdm-pid
    DisplayManager.keyFile:		/usr/X/lib/xdm/xdm-keys
    DisplayManager.servers:		/usr/X/lib/xdm/Xservers
    DisplayManager._0.authorize:	true
    DisplayManager*authComplain:	false
    DisplayManager._0.setup:        /usr/X/lib/xdm/Xsetup_0
    DisplayManager._0.terminateServer:	true
    DisplayManager._1.authorize:	true
    DisplayManager._1.setup:	/usr/X/lib/xdm/Xsetup_1
    DisplayManager._1.terminateServer:	true

 o Copy /usr/X/lib/xdm/Xsetup_0 to /usr/X/lib/xdm/Xsetup_1.

 o Quit the desktop.

 o When the graphical login re-appears select Exit.

 o Login as root

 o Run

    sh /etc/rc2.d/S69xdm start

4. Performance impact

   Running that second desktop of course has impact on the overall
   performance of the affected UnixWare server. Basically it is just
   as running a second user on the machine.

   The tuneables affected are NPROC and MAXUP which deal with the
   number of processes a user may run and the total number of processes
   allowed on the system. NPROC and  MAXUP are autotuned which means
   that both values are depending on the amount of memory installed.
   Raising memory will allow more processes on the system.

   With the second desktop on the system a raise on both tuneables
   may be necessary either via RAM increase or manual increase of
   the kernel values (the latter takes both tuneables out of control
   of autotuning. See Autotune (4) for more details). Check the current
   load of the system to see if a raise is necessary or not.

   If NPROC and MAXUP are raised but still processes fail to start
   one may want to check swap space with the swap (1M) cocmmand.
   In case swap space is insufficient add more swap space to overcome
   this (there is a document detailing the  steps necessary available
   from Novell on the internet and the NSEPro).

5. De-installation

   To de-install, copy the saved files back to their original names
   i.e.

   cp /usr/X/lib/xdm/Xservers /usr/X/lib/xdm/Xservers.2nd_desktop
   cp /usr/X/lib/xdm/xdm-config /usr/X/lib/xdm/xdm-config.2nd_desktop


   cp /usr/X/lib/xdm/Xservers.original /usr/X/lib/xdm/Xservers
   cp /usr/X/lib/xdm/xdm-config.original /usr/X/lib/xdm/xdm-config

   and restart the desktop as described with the installation
   procedure.
