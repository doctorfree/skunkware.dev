	Building Perl v5.001m for UnixWare 2.02 with SDK

	Below, I have retained sections only where the response is 
	not the default. The *** WHOA THERE!!! *** items were all
	changed to use the newly discovered function, but you may
	wish to stay with the Perl defaults. I excluded /usr/local/lib
	from the clutches of Perl.
	Installation will be to /opt and subdirectories.

# Configure
 
Beginning of configuration questions for perl5.
 
Checking echo to see how to suppress newlines...
...using \c
The star should be here-->*
 
First let's make sure your kit is complete.  Checking...
Looks good...
You may give one or more space-separated answers, or "none" if appropriate.
If your OS version has no hints, DO NOT give a wrong version -- say "none".

Which of these apply, if any? [svr4] 

Directories to use for library searches?
[/lib /usr/lib /usr/ccs/lib /usr/ucblib /usr/local/lib]   (Breaking for Mail)
	/lib /usr/lib /usr/ccs/lib /usr/ucblib
 
gconvert() found.
 
*** WHOA THERE!!! ***
    The recommended value for $d_gconvert on this machine was "undef"!
    Keep the recommended value? [y] n
We'll use it to convert floats into a string then.
 
By default, perl5 will be installed in /usr/local/bin, manual
pages under /usr/local/man, etc..., i.e. with /usr/local as prefix for
all installation directories. Typically set to /usr/local, but you
may choose /usr if you wish to install perl5 among your system
binaries. If you wish to have binaries under /bin but manual pages
under /usr/local/man, that's ok: you will be prompted separately
for each of the installation directories, the prefix being only used
to set the defaults.

Installation prefix to use? (~name ok) [/usr/local] /opt

There are some auxiliary files for perl5 that need to be put into a
private library directory that is accessible by everyone.

Pathname where the private library files will reside? (~name ok)
[/opt/lib/perl5] /opt/lib/perl5.001m

Perl5 contains architecture-dependent library files.  If you are
sharing libraries in a heterogeneous environment, you might store
these files in a separate location.  Otherwise, you can just include
them with the rest of the public library files.

Where do you want to put the public architecture-dependent libraries? (~name ok)
[/opt/lib/perl5.001m/i386-svr4] 
Directory /opt/lib/perl5.001m/i386-svr4 doesn't exist.  Use that name anyway?
[n] y
 
Checking whether your compiler can handle __attribute__ ...
Your C compiler doesn't seem to understand __attribute__ at all.
 
bcmp() found.
 
*** WHOA THERE!!! ***
    The recommended value for $d_bcmp on this machine was "undef"!
    Keep the recommended value? [y] n
 
bcopy() found.
 
*** WHOA THERE!!! ***
    The recommended value for $d_bcopy on this machine was "undef"!
    Keep the recommended value? [y] n
 
setpgrp() found.
 
(I see you are running Configure as super-user...)
You have to use setpgrp() instead of setpgrp(pid, pgrp).
 
bzero() found.
 
*** WHOA THERE!!! ***
    The recommended value for $d_bzero on this machine was "undef"!
    Keep the recommended value? [y] n
 

What directory should we install the shared libperl into? (~name ok)
[/opt/lib/perl5.001m/i386-svr4/CORE] 
Directory /opt/lib/perl5.001m/i386-svr4/CORE doesn't exist.  Use that name anyway?
[n] y
 
getpriority() found.
 
*** WHOA THERE!!! ***
    The recommended value for $d_getprior on this machine was "undef"!
    Keep the recommended value? [y] n
 
killpg() found.
 
*** WHOA THERE!!! ***
    The recommended value for $d_killpg on this machine was "undef"!
    Keep the recommended value? [y] n
 
 
Checking to see if your bcopy() can do overlapping copies...
Yes, it can.
 
*** WHOA THERE!!! ***
    The recommended value for $d_safebcpy on this machine was "undef"!
    Keep the recommended value? [y] n
 
setlinebuf() found.
 
*** WHOA THERE!!! ***
    The recommended value for $d_setlinebuf on this machine was "undef"!
    Keep the recommended value? [y] n
 
setpriority() found.
 
*** WHOA THERE!!! ***
    The recommended value for $d_setprior on this machine was "undef"!
    Keep the recommended value? [y] n
 
setregid() found.
 
*** WHOA THERE!!! ***
    The recommended value for $d_setregid on this machine was "undef"!
    Keep the recommended value? [y] n
 
 
setreuid() found.
 
*** WHOA THERE!!! ***
    The recommended value for $d_setreuid on this machine was "undef"!
    Keep the recommended value? [y] n
 
 
Pathname where the public executables will reside? (~name ok) [/opt/bin] 
  
Where do the Perl5 library man pages (source) go? (~name ok)
[/opt/lib/perl5.001m/man/man3] /opt/man/man3
