inn version 1.4

inn-1.4.src.tar.gz - sources with my minor modifications.
config.data is modified extensively.

inn-1.4.bin.p1.tar.gz - INN binaries from /usr/local/etc - innd and in.nnrpd.
inn-1.4.bin.p2.tar.gz - INN binaries from /usr/local/news/bin
inn-1.4.bin.p3.tar.gz - INN binaries  for /usr/bin/rnews and 
		/usr/local/lib/news/innshellvars

Note that the binary distribution  are homed at /local (I
have /usr/local symlinked to /local here) and they should live in
/usr/local.


I compiled INN with GCC 2.6.3 and didn't try cc.

If you'll have any problems with INN, please let me know!

Sincerely,

		- Sasha -
