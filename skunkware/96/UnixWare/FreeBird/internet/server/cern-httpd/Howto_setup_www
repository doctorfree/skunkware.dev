With UnixWare its very simple to setup a WWW server.
This article will guide you through the process, which with the
CERN version of http  is typically just a few minutes.

There are precompiled binaries for UnixWare available, see

        ftp.novell.de:/pub/unixware/usle/internet
	ftp.novell.co.uk:/pub/unixware/usle/internet
	ftp.wordperfect.com:/pub/unixware/usle/internet
	netlab1.usu.edu:/pub/mirror/usle/internet
	netlab2.usu.edu:/pub/mirror/usle/internet
	ftp.abs.net:/unixware/usle/internet

PLEASE NOTE that the binaries on ftp.novell.com:/pub/WWW are
out of date , a snapshot from April 12th and should no longer
be used.

In the  usle/internet directory you will find server, client and 
systools directories.

The server directory contains two www servers, the CERN
version and the NCSA version. These are ready to run versions.
The example below uses the CERN version , which we prefer to use
due to its proxy and caching features. Its also written by the
team who are now in w3.org.

The steps to setup a WWW Server on UnixWare are attached below:

(a) Get the CERN server  files from your nearest "usle" archive

	cd /tmp
	ftp ftp.wordperfect.com    [ ftp.novell.de ]

	cd /pub/unixware/usle/internet/server
	cd cern-httpd

	bin
	get httpd-3.0.pkg.tar		 (the server pkg)
	quit

(b) unwind the pkg.tar file into /tmp

	tar xvf httpd-3.0.pkg.tar

(c) Install the package:

(for UW1 and UW2) pkgadd -d `pwd`

or, if you're into using the GUI

(for UW2) Use the GUI App_installer to install the package

	Enter GUI app-installer under admin_tools
	Select Other for "Install From:", and enter /tmp
	Select Update view
	Click on the httpd icon and select install
	Read the blue screens , hit enter

1 minute later you now have a WWW server installed and
running, nothing else to do, it even comes with a test page

Note this package installs httpd into /opt/bin,
the server configuration files into /opt/lib/httpd
and the WWW pages are located in /home/www.
	
(d) Download a www browser client to test with

	ftp ftp.wordperfect.com		[ftp ftp.novell.de]
	bin
	cd /pub/unixware/usle/internet/client
	cd mosaic	
	get mosaic-2.6.pkg.tar.Z
	quit

	zcat mosaic-2.6.pkg.tar.Z|tar xvf -

Either use pkgadd -d `pwd`, or
Use app-installer as above, select the globe icon for mosaic
to put it in your applications folder

Double click on the Mosaic icon, and hit the globe to interrupt
the lookup for www.novell.com. 
Hit Open and enter

		http://localhost/

	or
		http://your-node/

	where your-node is your nodename

(Note to customise the Mosaic home page, add a line

Mosaic*HomeDocument: http://your-starting-page

to .Xdefaults-Nodename , where Nodename is the output of uname -n)

(e) To find out more on how to configure the CERN server , download the html
docs for the server

	cd /tmp
	ftp ftp.wordperfect.com    [ ftp.novell.de ]

	cd cd /pub/unixware/usle/internet/server
	cd cern-httpd

	bin
	get cern_httpd_docs.tar.Z	 (docs for server config in html)
	quit


To install the docs

	cd /home/www     (where this server puts the docs)

	zcat /tmp/cern_http_docs.tar.Z|tar xvf -

	
To read the docs

	
	In a browser open URL

		http://localhost/httpd_docs/


(f) If you want a very simple demo for Unixware

Download the files
ftp.novell.de:/pub/unixware/usle/internet/server/cern-httpd/WWWdemopages.README
ftp.novell.de:/pub/unixware/usle/internet/server/cern-httpd/WWWdemopages.tar.Z

(g) If you run a heavily loaded site consider running httpd as
a standalone daemon
ftp.novell.de:/pub/unixware/usle/internet/server/cern-httpd/httpd.standalone
