smap/smapd 

From the TIS Firewall Toolkit V1.3

Ported to UnixWare2 /rmail subsystem


smap is a simple incoming smtp daemon invoked from inetd.
Its job in life is to store incoming mail for processing by
smapd. It runs chroot'd in the incoming mail spool area.

smapd reads mail from the incoming spool area, and hands it
off to the real mail subsystem

The idea behind this mailer is that smap is simple and understandable
and robust, and can be run on a firewall - you can also run
it as a replacement to the stock smtpd daemon if you prefer -
and this allows you to use tcp wrappers if you wish.

The files below contains a new /etc/rc2.d/S81smtp script
that auto detects if smapd is in place and runs smapd
on system startup - this assumes you'll reconfigure
your inetd to include the smap and restart it.

If you have the base UW2.01 or UW2.02 with no mailfixes get mfix.tar
from ftp.novell.com or mailupd.tar.Z from this server 
(hints/Mail/mailupd.tar.Z)

smap/smapd use syslog for logging, tail -f /var/adm/log/osmlog


To install 

	mkdir /opt/etc
	ln -s /opt /usr/local   # smap/smapd look in /usr/local/etc

	cp smap smapd netperm-table /opt/etc

	chmod +rx /opt/etc/smap*
	chmod 555 /opt/etc/netperm-table

	mkdir /var/spool/mailq/smapin
	mkdir /var/spool/mailq/smapin/bad

	chown smtp:mail /var/spool/mailq/smapin /var/spool/mailq/smapin/bad
	chmod 700 /var/spool/mailq/smapin /var/spool/mailq/smapin/bad

	sh /etc/rc2.d/S81smtp stop
	cp /etc/rc2.d/S81smtp /etc/rc2.d/.S81smtp.orig
	cp S81smtp /etc/rc2.d/S81smtp
	sh /etc/rc2.d/S81smtp start


	
Edit inetd.conf and add the appropriate lines from the inetd.conf file

Restart inetd using kill -HUP {PID}

where you get {PID} from ps -ef|grep inetd
