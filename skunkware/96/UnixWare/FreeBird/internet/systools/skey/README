S/Key - A proceedure to use one time passwords for accessing computer systems.
(This version used with internet/server/fwtk/sample-binaries)

S/key is a proceedure for using one time password to authenticate access to
compter systems. It uses 64 bits of information transformed by either
the MD4 algorithm or the (stronger) MD5 algorithm.  The user supplies
the 64 bits in the form of 6 English words that are generated by a
secure computer, such as a pocket sized smart card, a PC, a Macintosh,
or a machine at work and printed on a sheet of paper.
