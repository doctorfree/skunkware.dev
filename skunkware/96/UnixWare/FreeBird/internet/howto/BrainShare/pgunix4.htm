<h2>Setting up your UnixWare system as an Anonymous FTP server</h2>
<p>
One of the traditional uses of UNIX on the Internet has been as an Anonymous FTP server.  Having an Anonymous FTP server allows you to share files on the Internet without having to worry about  user passwords and allows you to restrict incoming users to seeing only a limited part of the file system.
<p>
Setting UnixWare up as an Anonymous FTP server is extremely easy. 
Simply ftp to ftp.novell.de:/pub/unixware/usle/internet/server/wuftpd
and obtain a binary package. There is also a hints
file on that server in usle/hints/Networking/anon-ftp which describes
the various steps to setup a server.
