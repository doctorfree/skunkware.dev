<h2>Setting up your serial device</h2>
<p>
One of the very first things you will be doing is setting up your serial communications device.  The following example is based on setting up of a modem, but the same information applies to setting up other serial devices. The easiest way to configure the serial device is through the graphical administration tools. If however, you wish to use the character mode, you may refer to the System Owners Handbook, chapter 8, for more information on how to edit the configuration files in the /etc/uucp directory.

From the desktop you will go to "Admin_Tools->Networking->Dialup_Setup."  (Remember that you must have permission to use the dialup setup.)  Your  first action will be to set up your serial connection.  To do this go to "Action->New" and it will pop up a screen which will allow you to create a new device.  In this screen you will fill in information on your com port, modem type, and modem speed.  Once you click on add a new serial device will be created for you in the /etc/Devices file.

Next you will need to tell your computer about the remote system you will be connecting to.  In order  to do this you will want to click on "System->New" and add the information on the remote system name, type of connection, connection speed, and phone number. (NOTE: To wait for a dial tone use an "=".  To get a four second pause use a "-".)  Now click on Basic Setting to get the next screen of information.  This screen is used for putting in any necessary information on the login sequence. Once you press add you will have a new remote system described in your /etc/Systems file.
