There are other useful things you can do with your UnixWare system.  These include setting your box up as a Domain Name Server (refer to chapter  13 of the Network Admin Guide), Setting the system up to be a Usenet News server, setting up WAIS and Gopher.  You might even decide your box should be a BBS.  The tools for doing any of these things are included in the "software shop->binaries" on this server.  The "software shope" includes many other free binaries which might also interest you.  The sources are also available so that you can make any modifications you desire.  So take a look and try them out!
