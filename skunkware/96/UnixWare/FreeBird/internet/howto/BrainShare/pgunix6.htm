<h2>Setting up your UnixWare system as an electronic mail server</h2>
<p>
A final item that many people want is electronic mail.  UnixWare supports SMTP and MHS.  By default a basic mail service is enabled.  However, if you are going to have users mailing information from one system to another you will need to configure your email.  With UnixWare you can configure items  like  "Smarter Hosts" and "Clusters".  The easiest way to configure this information is to use the graphical administration tools.  However, you may still use the character method to change the mail configuration files. 
<p>
To configure you email using the graphical tools you will go into "Admin_Tools->Mail_Setup".  First you will want to set up the information under the Basic category.  This information includes: cluster name, smart host system name, routing information, and logging of messages. Next you would go to the Extended category where you would configure information on what the email message will look like, the debugging level you desire, and domain information.  Once you click on the "OK" button this information will all be saved in the configuration files.
