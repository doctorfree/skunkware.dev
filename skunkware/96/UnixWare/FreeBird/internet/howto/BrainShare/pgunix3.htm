<h2>Setting up your UnixWare system with a Point-to-Point (PPP) connection</h2>
<p>
<p>
To configure a system for outgoing PPP calls, you will need to perform the following  items:
<p>
Set up your serial device (see above steps).
<p>
Configure your local PPP host.  To do this you will use the command /usr/sbin/pppconf.  (NOTE: You  must have root access to use this command.)  During this command you will enter information to "Configure a PPP host."  The information you add here will set up your local PPP IP address, remote PPP IP address, subnet mask address, and UUCP name for the remote system, which is the one you created in the /etc/Systems file.
<p>
Configure an Incoming PPP Parameters.  (Do this step if you want to receive PPP calls.)  Again use the /usr/sbin/pppconf command.  This time select "Configure incoming PPP parameters."  You will be asked information about the PPP login name (this name must match the name used in the remote systems's Systems file for the outgoing PPP hosts), whether you want to also create a user login for the PPP login name, the PPP negotiation parameters you will be using (information on these parameters can be found in the Network Administration manual), and remote PPP IP address.
<p>
Configure the Authentication Parameters. (NOTE:  you will be performing this step if you want to have your local PPP host to authenticate incoming calls from remote PPP hosts or if you local PPP host communicates with remote PPP hosts which require authentication.) Again you will be using the pppconf command; however, this time you will select "Configure PPP authentication parameters".  Here you will be giving information on the local host ID and password and the remote host ID and password.
<p>
Now your ready to test things out.  Using the "ifconfig -a" command you will want to check to make sure your PPP device is configured correctly.  If not, return to pppconf and modify it. Second make sure your port is working correctly by using the cu command.  Finally test out your PPP connection with the ping command to the remote system.
