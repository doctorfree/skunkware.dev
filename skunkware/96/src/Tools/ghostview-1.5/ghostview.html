     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          The <EM>ghostview</EM> program provides an X11 user interface for the
          <EM>ghostscript</EM> interpreter.  <EM>Ghostview</EM> and <EM>ghostscript</EM> function
          as two cooperating programs.  <EM>Ghostview</EM> creates the viewing
          window and <EM>ghostscript</EM> draws in it.

          Don't be alarmed by the number of options.  Generally, one
          invokes <EM>ghostview</EM> with just one parameter, the name of the
          file to be previewed.  If the filename is ``-'', <EM>ghostview</EM>
          will read from ``stdin''.  The options provide a way to set
          X resources from the command line for a single invocation of
          <EM>ghostview</EM>.  For that reason, discussion of the options is
          delayed until after the X resources are discussed.

     <STRONG>MAIN</STRONG> <STRONG>WINDOW</STRONG>
          The main viewport is on the right side of the main window.
          If the page is larger than the viewport, there will be
          scroll bars along the bottom and right edges of the
          viewport.  To the left of the viewport is the table of
          contents.  If the PostScript file has document structuring
          convention (DSC) comments, the table of context will display
          the page labels (i.e. usually page numbers).  To the left of
          the table of contents is the menu box.  Each push button
          brings up a popup menu.  Over the menu box and table of
          contents there are three optional labels that contain the
          title, date, and locator.  The title label contains the
          document title found in the DSC comments.  If no title can
          be found, the filename is used in its place.  The date label
          contains the document date found in the DSC comments.  If no
          date can be found, the last modified date of the file is
          used in its place.  Since the title and date labels may be
          clipped by the main viewport, the date and title labels are
          push buttons that bring up a popup window with the title or
          date.  These popup windows also show the ``document'' icon
          when the displayed string comes from the DSC comments.  The
          locator shows the location of the cursor in the viewport.
          The location is expressed in the default user coordinate
          system.  The locator is useful for measuring bounding boxes.

          Within the main viewport the mouse cursor is a ``target''
          when <EM>ghostscript</EM> is doing work.  The cursor is a ``cross
          hair'' when <EM>ghostscript</EM> is idle.  When moving to another
          page in a document, it is generally best to wait for
          <EM>ghostscript</EM> to become idle.  Otherwise, the current
          <EM>ghostscript</EM> process must be killed and the overhead of
          reading the prologue is incurred again.

          <EM>Ghostview</EM> will check to see if the file has been modified
          just before it displays a page or when the application is
          deiconified.  If the file has changed, it will reopen the
          file.

          Clicking anywhere within the viewport will popup a zoom
          window.  The window is centered about the location that was
          clicked.  Clicking with the first mouse button pops up a low
          resolution zoom window.  Clicking with the second mouse
          button pops up a medium resolution zoom window.  Clicking
          with the third mouse button pops up a high resolution zoom
          window.  The cursor in the zoom window will display a
          ``target'' or ``cross hair'' depending on the state of
          <EM>ghostscript</EM>.  The locator reports the position of the cursor
          in the zoom windows as well as the main viewport.

          In the table of contents, the first and third mouse button
          function exactly as they do in a Text widget.  That is the
          first mouse button selects text and the third mouse button
          extends selections.  However, clicking on a page label with
          the second mouse button will cause that page to be shown.
          The page being displayed is marked with a '&lt;' in the right
          margin of the table of contents.

     <STRONG>POPUP</STRONG> <STRONG>WINDOWS</STRONG>
          There are several additional windows that may appear.  The
          <EM>copyright</EM> window will appear whenever copyright information
          is requested.  The <EM>information</EM> window appears whenever the
          <EM>ghostscript</EM> process writes to ``stdout'' or ``stderr''.
          Whenever there is an error in the PostScript program, the
          stack trace will appear in this window.  When <EM>ghostscript</EM> is
          invoked without the quiet option, informational message
          regarding the state of <EM>ghostscript</EM> will appear in the
          <EM>information</EM> window.  The <EM>copyright</EM> and <EM>information</EM> windows
          can be dismissed by pushing the ``Dismiss'' button.

          The <EM>Select</EM> <EM>File</EM> dialog widget will appear when you wish to
          open or save a file.  The <EM>Select</EM> <EM>File</EM> dialog widget allows
          an X11 user to select a file by typing the path or by
          browsing in directory listings and selecting entries with
          the mouse.

          The space bar can be pressed to complete filenames, and
          tilde is used for home directories.  All the usual key
          bindings can be used in the text widget, except for Return
          and Control-M, which are equivalent to pressing the OK
          button.  The path can be scrolled using the large horizontal
          scroll bar, or by moving the insertion cursor in the text
          widget.  The directory entries can be scrolled using the
          vertical scroll bars, or by holding a mouse button down and
          moving out of the listing.  The scrolling speed varies with
          the distance from the listing.

          The directory entries are terminated with special characters
          that show the type of entry, similar to the -<STRONG>F</STRONG> option of
          <EM>ls</EM>(1).

          The <EM>Select</EM> <EM>File</EM> dialog widget is in total control until is
          pops down.  No other controls in <EM>ghostview</EM> will be active
          during this time.

     <STRONG>MENUS</STRONG>
          There are five buttons in the menu box.  They are the <STRONG>File</STRONG>,
          <STRONG>Page</STRONG>, <STRONG>Magstep</STRONG>, <STRONG>Orientation</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Media</STRONG> buttons.  There are
          keyboard accelerators for most of the popup menus.  Be sure
          to read the keyboard accelerator section.

          <STRONG>File</STRONG>      This popup menu controls file access:

                    <STRONG>Open...</STRONG>   Pops up the Select File window in
                              preparation to open a file.  The Select
                              File widget is in total control until it
                              pops down.  Opens the file for viewing.

                    <STRONG>Reopen</STRONG>    Reopens the current file.

                    <STRONG>Print...</STRONG>  Pops up a dialog widget to ask for the
                              printer name.  Sends the whole document
                              to the printer.

                    <STRONG>Print</STRONG> <STRONG>marked</STRONG> <STRONG>pages...</STRONG>
                              Pops up a dialog widget to ask for the
                              printer name.  Sends the marked pages to
                              the printer.  If no pages have been
                              marked, the mark procedure is called
                              before printing and then the unmark
                              procedure is called after printing.

                    <STRONG>Save</STRONG> <STRONG>marked</STRONG> <STRONG>pages...</STRONG>
                              Pops up the Select File window in
                              preparation to save a file.  The Select
                              File widget is in total control until it
                              pops down.  Saves the marked pages in
                              the selected file.  If no pages have
                              been marked, the mark procedure is
                              called before saving and then the unmark
                              procedure is called after saving.

                    <STRONG>Copyright...</STRONG>
                              Pops up the <EM>copyright</EM> window.

                    <STRONG>Quit</STRONG>      Causes <EM>ghostview</EM> to exit.

          <STRONG>Page</STRONG>      This popup menu controls page access:

                    <STRONG>Next</STRONG>      Display the next page.

                    <STRONG>Redisplay</STRONG> Display the current page.

                    <STRONG>Previous</STRONG>  Display the previous page.

                    <STRONG>Center</STRONG>    Center the page in the viewport.

                    <STRONG>Mark</STRONG>      Mark the pages that have been selected
                              in the table of contents.  If no pages
                              have been selected, mark the current
                              page.

                    <STRONG>Unmark</STRONG>    Unmark the pages that have been selected
                              in the table of contents.  If no pages
                              have been selected, unmark the current
                              page.

          <STRONG>Magstep</STRONG>   The Magstep menu controls the magnification at
                    which the document is viewed.  The default magstep
                    of 0 implies no magnification (i.e. the size on
                    the screen should match the size on paper).
                    <EM>Ghostview</EM> borrows the notion of magstep from TeX.
                    The magnification is defined to be 1.2**magstep.
                    At magstep 1, the document is magnified by 1.2.
                    At magstep -1, the document is reduced by 1.2.
                    The Magstep menu lists values from -5 to 5.

          <STRONG>Orientation</STRONG>
                    The Orientation menu controls the display
                    orientation.  A ``dot'' appears in front of the
                    current orientation.  The first mouse button sets
                    the default orientation.  The DSC comments may
                    specify an orientation of Portrait or Landscape
                    that overrides the default.  In this case, a
                    "document" appears in front of the current
                    orientation.  The second mouse button can be used
                    to ``force'' the orientation on a document to
                    override the DSC comments.  If an orientation is
                    being forced, then a ``tie fighter'' will appear
                    in front of the current orientation.

                    <STRONG>Portrait</STRONG>  Set the orientation to Portrait. This
                              implies no rotation.  A portrait
                              orientation indicates that the longest
                              edge of the paper is parallel to the
                              vertical (y) axis.

                    <STRONG>Landscape</STRONG> Set the orientation to Landscape.  This
                              implies a clockwise rotation of the
                              paper by 90 degrees.  A landscape
                              orientation indicates that the longest
                              edge of the paper is parallel to the
                              horizontal (x) axis.

                    <STRONG>Upside-down</STRONG>
                              Set the orientation to Upside-Down.

                    <STRONG>Seascape</STRONG>  Set the orientation to Seascape.  This
                              implies a counterclockwise rotation of
                              the paper by 90 degrees.

                    <STRONG>Swap</STRONG> <STRONG>Landscape</STRONG>
                              Swap the meaning of Landscape and
                              Seascape.  Most of the Landscape
                              documents that I have encountered
                              require a 90 clockwise rotation of the
                              paper to view.   However, there is no
                              standard and some documents need to be
                              rotated the other way.  The swap
                              landscape button allows <EM>ghostview</EM> to
                              automatically rotate the document the
                              right way in response to the
                              <STRONG>%%Orientation</STRONG> comment in the PostScript
                              file.

          <STRONG>Media</STRONG>     The entries on the Media menu set the page media.
                    Media defined in the document appear at the
                    beginning of the menu separated by a line from the
                    standard media.  A ``dot'' appears in front of the
                    current media.  The first mouse button sets the
                    default media.  The DSC comments may specify the
                    page media that overrides the default.  In this
                    case, a "document" appears in front of the current
                    media.  The second mouse button can be used to
                    ``force'' the media on a document to override the
                    DSC comments.  Forcing the media on an EPSF figure
                    will override the Bounding Box.  This makes is
                    easy to view a figure with an incorrect
                    <STRONG>%%BoundingBox</STRONG> comment.  If a media is being
                    forced, then a ``tie fighter'' will appear in
                    front of the current media.

                    Here are the standard media names and their sizes.
                    The size is given as the width and height in
                    PostScript points.

     <STRONG>KEYBOARD</STRONG> <STRONG>ACCELERATORS</STRONG>
          Most of the popup menu commands have an equivalent action
          that can be invoked from the keyboard.  The popup menu entry
          must be sensitive (i.e. not grayed out) for the action to
          have effect.  Here is the default keyboard binding:

          <STRONG>Q</STRONG>         Bound to <STRONG>GhostviewQuit()</STRONG> which is equivalent to
                    pushing the <STRONG>Quit</STRONG> menu button on the <STRONG>Ghostview</STRONG>

                    ``"lpr" command failed.''.

          <STRONG>openPrompt</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>OpenPrompt)</STRONG>
                    Sets the prompt used to ask for a file name to
                    open.  The default value is ``Open File: ''.

          <STRONG>openFail</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>OpenFail)</STRONG>
                    Sets the string used to inform the user that the
                    open failed.  The default value is
                    ``Cannot open file: ''.

          <STRONG>savePrompt</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>SavePrompt)</STRONG>
                    Sets the prompt used to ask for a file name to
                    save.  The default value is ``Save File: ''.

          <STRONG>saveFail</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>SaveFail)</STRONG>
                    Sets the string used to inform the user that the
                    save failed.  The default value is
                    ``Cannot save file: ''.

          <STRONG>openWindows</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>OpenWindows)</STRONG>
                    OpenWindows servers sometimes cause error messages
                    about bitmaps not being 1 bit deep.  Turning on
                    this resource avoids the problem by not using any
                    bitmaps.  You lose the functionality of having the
                    current magstep, orientation and media marked on
                    the popup menus.  The default value is ``false''.

          <STRONG>ncdwm</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>Ncdwm)</STRONG>
                    The Xt Intrinsics has a bug that causes bogus
                    information in the window manager size hints.
                    <EM>Ncdwm</EM> and possibly other window managers get
                    confused by the bogus information and make the
                    window extremely small.  <EM>Twm</EM> and <EM>mwm</EM> ignore the
                    bogus information.  Turning on the resource avoids
                    the problem with <EM>ncdwm</EM> by doing things slightly
                    differently.  However, this can confuse other
                    window managers such as <EM>mwm</EM>.  This bug is fixed in
                    X11R5 fix-10.  You should only set this resource
                    if you have the problem.  The default value is
                    ``false''.

     <STRONG>GHOSTVIEW</STRONG> <STRONG>WIDGET</STRONG> <STRONG>RESOURCES</STRONG>
          Certain resources in the Ghostview widget may be set by the
          user.  These selected resources are presented below.

          <STRONG>arguments</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>Arguments)</STRONG>
                    Additional arguments passed to the interpreter.
                    It is convenient to name files that preload fonts
                    here for PostScript programs that continually
                    reload fonts while rendering a page.  The default
                    is no additional arguments.

          <STRONG>busyCursor</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>Cursor)</STRONG>
                    The cursor shown when <EM>ghostscript</EM> is rendering to
                    the window.  The busy cursor is set to the
                    ``target'' by the application defaults.

          <STRONG>cursor</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>Cursor)</STRONG>
                    The cursor shown when <EM>ghostscript</EM> is idle.  The
                    default cursor is the ``crosshair''.

          <STRONG>interpreter</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>Interpreter)</STRONG>
                    The name of the executable to call to render the
                    PostScript.  It is convenient to set this resource
                    to the path of an alternate version of ghostscript
                    for testing.  The default value is ``gs''.

          <STRONG>palette</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>Palette)</STRONG>
                    Tells <EM>ghostscript</EM> how to restrict the palette used
                    when rendering.  The possible values are
                    ``color'', ``grayscale'', and ``monochrome''.  The
                    default value is ``color''.

          <STRONG>quiet</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>Quiet)</STRONG>
                    Tells <EM>ghostscript</EM> whether to supress informational
                    messages.  The default value is ``true''.

          <STRONG>safer</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>Safer)</STRONG>
                    Tells <EM>ghostscript</EM> whether to run in ``safer''
                    mode.  The default value is ``true''.

          <STRONG>useBackingPixmap</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>UseBackingPixmap)</STRONG>
                    Tells whether to use a backing pixmap.  If this
                    resource is false, backing store is requested on
                    the Ghostview window.  Some X servers have limited
                    resources for large pixmaps.  Also, some X
                    servers' backing store is much faster than using a
                    backing pixmap.  You should reset this resource if
                    your X server is one of the server types
                    mentioned.  The default value is ``true''.

          <STRONG>xdpi</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>Resolution)</STRONG>
                    Sets the X resolution of the window in dots per
                    inch.  You can use this resource to affect the
                    main window.  Zoom windows have their X dpi set
                    explicitly in the program.  The default value is
                    calculated from the screen metrics.

          <STRONG>ydpi</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>Resolution)</STRONG>
                    Sets the Y resolution of the window in dots per
                    inch.  You can use this resource to affect the
                    main window.  Zoom windows have their Y dpi set
                    explicitly in the program.  The default value is
                    calculated from the screen metrics.

     <STRONG>GHOSTVIEW</STRONG> <STRONG>WIDGET</STRONG> <STRONG>ACTIONS</STRONG>
          <STRONG>notify(width</STRONG> <STRONG>height</STRONG> <STRONG>xdpi</STRONG> <STRONG>ydpi)</STRONG>
                    The notify event is used by the ghostview
                    application for the locator and popup zoom
                    windows.  If the width and height are 0, the event
                    is user for the locator.  Otherwise, it triggers a
                    popup zoom window.  The default width and height
                    are 72.  The default xdpi and ydpi are 300.  The
                    height will default to the width if the height is
                    omitted.  The xdpi will default to the xdpi if the
                    ydpi is omitted.

     <STRONG>ENVIRONMENT</STRONG>
          <STRONG>LPDEST</STRONG>    The LPDEST environment variable gives the default
                    printer destination on System V.

          <STRONG>PRINTER</STRONG>   The PRINTER environment variable gives the default
                    printer destination on BSD.

     <STRONG>LIMITATIONS</STRONG>
          If the document does not begin with ``%!PS-Adobe-'', it does
          not claim conformance to the document structuring
          convention.  When these documents are encountered, the
          functionality of <EM>ghostview</EM> is limited to giving you scroll
          bars and a next page capability.  Because there is no table
          of contents, skipping around the document and marking pages
          is impossible.

          If there is no table of contents for the document, the popup
          zoom window will always show the first page.

     <STRONG>BUGS</STRONG>
          If you find a bug, please send a bug report to
          ghostview@cs.wisc.edu.
