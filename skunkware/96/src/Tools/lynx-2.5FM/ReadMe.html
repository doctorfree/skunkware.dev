Lynx version 2-5FM of 96-07-19
</H1>
</CENTER>
This is Lynx version 2.5FM of 96-07-19 as built for SCO Skunkware '96.
<P>
"2.5FM" is a tag which does not indicate a specific version.  Continuing
Lynx development is being done by Foteos Macrides of the Worcester
Foundation for Biomedical Research.  During development, frequent (often
nightly) snapshots of the source are issued.
<P>
This package was built by Bela Lubkin of SCO,
<A HREF="mailto:belal@sco.com">(belal@sco.com)</A>,
for inclusion in the SCO Skunkware '96 CD-ROM.  I chose to use the very
latest developmental version of Lynx because it has many bug fixes and
corrections over the "official" Lynx 2.5 release, and because it builds
correctly on SCO operating systems, while 2.5 does not.
<P>
It is important to understand that this package was built from a
developmental release of the software.  Responsibility for the precise
details of this package lies with SCO and the person who built the
package (Bela Lubkin, <A HREF="mailto:belal@sco.com">(belal@sco.com)</A>
rather than with the Lynx development team.
<P>
If you have problems with this distribution of Lynx, please take the
following steps:
<OL>
  <LI> If it is a packaging problem or otherwise appears to be specific to
     this pre-compiled distribution, or to the SCO operating system
     under which you are using it, post a USENET News article to the
     newsgroup comp.unix.sco.misc (for OpenServer operating systems),
     comp.unix.unixware.misc (for UnixWare operating systems), or
	 comp.unix.xenix.sco (for Xenix operating systems).  Be
     specific about where you obtained the distribution and about the
     problem(s) experienced.

  <LI> If it appears to be a generic problem with this version of Lynx
     (not related to the operating system or to the way I built it),
     many resource are available to you.  Go to the web page:
<P>
       <A HREF="http://www.nyu.edu/pages/wsn/subir/lynx.html">
       http://www.nyu.edu/pages/wsn/subir/lynx.html</A>
<P>
     and follow the appropriate links.  Two of the most important
     resources are the archives of the Lynx Developer's mailing list,
     and the CHANGES file from the most recent developmental version of
     Lynx.  Check these to determine whether your problem has already
     been solved.  If at all possible, you should also obtain the latest
     Lynx sources (or newer binaries) and confirm that the problem you
     are experiencing has not been fixed.  Most problems are fixed
     quickly.  It is not polite to bother the developers about problems
     they have already fixed and passed by.
<P>
     If it is a newly discovered problem, it may be appropriate to
     contact the Lynx Developer's mailing list.  Information about the
     list is also found off of the above web page.  When corresponding
     to that list, be sure to identify the software you are running as
     "Lynx 2.5FM (SCO 07-19-96)".

The SCO Skunkware 96 Lynx 2.5FM offering consists of a 
<A HREF="../../../inst/lynx/">
custom installable SCO OpenServer 5 distribution</A> 
as well as the following six separate archives (of which you need
two to perform a binary install, or three to install binaries + source):

<OL>
  <LI> 
  <A HREF="Lynx2-5FM-src.tar.gz">Lynx2-5FM-src.tar.gz</A>
  is the source.  It consists of a copy of
     Foteos' development tree of 07-19-96, patched to correct certain
     pathnames to better fit the SCO OpenServer and SCO Skunkware
     environments.  The patch itself is included in the source archive,
     under the name 001-SKUNK-PATCH, and can be reversed by using GNU
     patch (also provided under SCO OpenServer Release 5 as patch(C)).

  <LI>
  <A HREF="Lynx2-5FM-cfg.tar.gz">Lynx2-5FM-cfg.tar.gz</A>
  contains Lynx configuration files.  It is
     organized so that it may be extracted from the root directory of an
     SCO system, and will place the appropriate files in the appropriate
     places, by running:
<PRE>
       cd /
       gzcat Lynx2-5FM-cfg.tar.gz | tar xf -
</PRE>
  <LI>
  <A HREF="Lynx2-5FM-bin-odt3.tar.gz">Lynx2-5FM-bin-odt3.tar.gz</A>
  contains a COFF executable binary to be
     run under SCO Open Desktop/Open Server 2.0 or 3.0, or SCO Unix
     3.2v4.0 through 3.2v4.2 with the corresponding version of SCO
     TCP/IP.
<P>
     This binary was constructed using the SCO OpenServer Release 5 USL
     C compiler with the ODT 3.0 headers and libraries.  The ODT 3.0
     MicroSoft cc fails to compile Lynx correctly and I didn't have gcc
     handy; it was less trouble to get USL cc running on my 3.0 system.
     [Don't try this at home...]

  <LI>
  <A HREF="Lynx2-5FM-bin-osr5.tar.gz">Lynx2-5FM-bin-osr5.tar.gz</A>
  contains an ELF executable binary to be
     run under SCO OpenServer Release 5.0.0 or later.
<P>
     This binary was constructed using the SCO OpenServer Release 5
     standard C compiler and development environment.

  <LI>
  <A HREF="Lynx2-5FM-bin-uw21.tar.gz">Lynx2-5FM-bin-uw21.tar.gz</A>
  contains an ELF executable binary to be
     run under SCO UnixWare 2.1.  It may work on earlier releases
     (almost certainly all 2.x releases), but I have not tested it.
<P>
     This binary was constructed using the SCO UnixWare 2.1 standard
     compiler and development environment.
  <LI> <A HREF="Lynx2-5FM-bin-x234.tar.gz">
  Lynx2-5FM-bin-x234.tar.gz</A>
  contains an x.out executable binary to
      be run under SCO Xenix 2.3.4 with SCO TCP/IP for Xenix 1.2.0.  It
      may work on earlier releases, but I have not tested it.
<P>
      This binary was constructed using a very bizarre mixture of the
      OpenServer Release 5 USL compiler, the Xenix 2.3.4 headers and
      libraries, weird patches to Lynx, spit, and glue.  It probably
	  can't be duplicated; you'll probably have to live with whatever
	  bugs it has.  I am not making the source modifications available,
	  though I may later check some of them into the ongoing development
	  tree to make it slightly easier to repeat this feat.

You must be aware of several paths used by the Lynx binaries.  The Lynx
configuration files are placed under /local/lib/lynx (you may use
symbolic links to point this directory elsewhere).  These are:
<PRE>
  /local/lib/lynx/lynx.cfg     -- global Lynx configuration file
  /local/lib/lynx/mime.types   -- maps MIME extensions
  /local/lib/lynx/mailcap      -- describes helper applications used by Lynx
  /local/lib/lynx/lynx_help/*  -- hierarchy of Lynx help files
</PRE>

Lynx is highly configurable through the above files, each of which
contains internal documentation.
<P>
Lynx also uses several external binaries.  Many of these are part of the
standard SCO operating system software, and will be found in their
standard locations.  Aside from those, Lynx may require the following
binaries:
<PRE>
  /local/bin/gzip
  /local/bin/zip
  /local/bin/unzip
</PRE>

Of these, only gzip should be used in standard browsing activity (and
then only if an HTTP server offers to transmit web pages in
gzip-compressed format).  Again, you may use symbolic links to point
these names elsewhere.  Each of the required binaries is available on
SCO Skunkware versions 2, 5, and 96.
<P>
Enjoy this software!
