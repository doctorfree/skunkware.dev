cwtmp: compress wtmp file data by removing uninteresting entries.
Usage: cwtmp [-ahnrvx] [-d<prefix>] -i<id[:id...]> [-[psw]<numrec>] [file]
cwtmp compresses a wtmp file by discarding the uninteresting utmp entries
that make up a large fraction of the typical wtmp file.  If no filename is
given, /etc/wtmp is read.  utmp entries in the file are written to the
output, except entries of type LOGIN_PROCESS and INIT_PROCESS, which are
skipped.
If the input file is not a multiple of the size of a utmp record and one
of the v, a, or f flags is not given, cwtmp will exit with an error
message and nonzero status.
Options:
-i<id[:id...]>: Discard entries whose id field is one of those given in
    the colon-separated list.
-t: Discard entries which have a non-empty user field and an empty line
    field.  These are usually commands run from inittab which are not
    associated with a tty.
-v: Check every utmp record for validity.  If an invalid record is found,
    scan the input character by character attempting to find the start of
    the next utmp record.  Invalid records are not output.
-a: Autoverify.  If the input file has a size that is not a multiple of
    the size of a utmp record, the -v option is turned on.
-x: Turn on verbose verification operation.  Various diagnostics are
    printed, including a description of which verification tests fail.
-d<name-prefix>: Entries whose ut_user field begins with the prefix are
    discarded.
-f: Do not fail if the input file does not have a valid size, and do no
    checking for utmp record validity.  This is liable to produce unuseful
    output if the input becomes unsynchronized, since the type test will
    likely be done on a field component that is not the type.
-n: Do not discard LOGIN_PROCESS and INIT_PROCESS entries.  This can be
    used to fix a file with the -v or -a option without compressing it.
-p<num-records>: Print a progress report to stderr after reading each
    <num-records> records.
-s<num-records>: Skip the initial <num-records> records in the file
    without looking at them.
-w<num-records>: Write <num-records> and then quit.
-r: Print records in readable form, rather that writing the utmp structs.
-0..-9: Remove entries with the given numeric type.  If any of these
    options are given, entries of type LOGIN_PROCESS and INIT_PROCESS are
    not removed unless their flags are explicitely given.  See utmp(F) for
    a description of the types.
