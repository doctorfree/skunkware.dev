	* Changelog: release of majordomo version 1.93

Sat Jan  7 17:35:18 1995  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@dstar.iddis.com)
 
        * FAQ: Added new faq that is updated for 1.93 release.
 
        * sample.cf:
        Added variables that control X.400 address analysis attempts. Turned
        off by default.
 
        * majordomo.pl:
        Added better do_exec_sendmail that doesn't append the nul arg to
        sendmail) which some sendmail lookalikes barf on).  I also added the
        code that attempts to handle X.400 addresses in a safe way. By default
        it isn't enabled. There is a varible that has to be set before it
        becomes active.
 
        * resend, new-list:
        removed main'do_exec_sendmail since it is done in majordomo.pl now.
 
        * config_parse.pl:
        Fixed error message and fixed bug where I did an open_temp and
        shouldn't have since the file was due tio be clobbered, but the file
        was in $listdir anyway, so it shouldn't be a security problem.
 
        * wrapper.c, Makefile:
        Fixed define for using setgroups, and added appropriate parameter to
        makefile for posix build.
 
Mon Jan  2 20:15:38 1995  John P. Rouillard (rouilj@dstar.iddis.com)
	Released majordomo 1.93beta1 for testing.

Mon Jan  2 19:31:38 1995  John P. Rouillard (rouilj@dstar.iddis.com)

	* FAQ
	Got newest FAQ from majordomo@pop.psu.edu, and corrected mkdigest
	usage that was stripped by the html parser.

        * archive2.pl:
        Added attribution for code, and added algorithm and labeled points in
        the code for a writeup of my analysis.
 
        * config_parse.pl:
        Added open_temp calls to writable open files for the config and
        newconfig file opens. In retrospect, they probably aren't necessary
        since being able to write the $listdir is a fatal security hole
        anyway.
 
        * README:
        Documented nature of race condition, and the assumptions that were
        made concerning the solution to the race condition.
 
        * README, Makefile, Changelog:
        Added text for 1.93beta1 release of majordomo.
 
        * Makefile: Fixed distribution target.
 
        * Makefile: Install the test script by default.
 
        * resend: fixed another administrivia filter
 
        * Changelog: updated

Mon Jan  2 00:20:12 1995  John P. Rouillard (rouilj@dstar.iddis.com)

        * approve:
        fixed bug with warn being a list argument and taking the return
	as an arg in a , statement

Sat Dec 31 23:00:29 1994  John P. Rouillard (rouilj@dstar.iddis.com)
 
        * shlock.pl:
        Added some debugging code for testing lock files, and cleaned error
	message.
 
        * archive2.pl:
        Compared device numbers as well as inode numbers for the files, and
        handle the case of a missing archive file properly by performing
        symbolic link and inode/device checks after the open has suceeded if
        the file didn't exist in the first place since the comparison is
        actually time invarient.
 
        * shlock.pl: Fixed the race condition in opening of the lock file.
 
        * majordomo.pl: Check device number for file as well as inode.
 
Tue Dec 27 20:43:44 1994  John P. Rouillard (rouilj@dstar.iddis.com)
 
        * bounce: Globbing no longer needed.
 
        * README:
        documented fix of shell glob failure on which and lists commands.
        remumbered fixes.
 
        * bounce: replaced glob on ~ for perl5 comptibility
 
        * majordomo: fixed list/which failure when globbing to many lists
 
        * README: included additional info on wrapper changes
 
Tue Dec 27 00:14:49 1994  John P. Rouillard (rouilj@dstar.iddis.com)

	* digest, majordomo.pl:
	Also have to check the filehandle to make sure that it doesn't have
	more than one link to it.

	* digest:
	Wrapper opens many temporary files, so I have (hopefully) implemented
	a more secure way of opening newly created files so that arbitary
	files owned by majordomo can't be overwriten/appended to.

Mon Dec 26 23:58:55 1994  John P. Rouillard (rouilj@dstar.iddis.com)

	* archive2.pl:
	Paul Phillips provided some code to close the following hole.
	
	Date:    Tue, 06 Dec 1994 01:48:46 PST
	From:    Paul Phillips <paulp@primus.COM>
	Subject: Serious security hole in archive2.pl
	
	I have found what I believe to be a very serious security hole in the
	archive2.pl script supplied with majordomo 1.92.
	
	Problem: Any user on the system can append to any file writable by the
	wrapper program.
	
	Explanation: The archive2.pl script takes as arguments an archive file
	(the -f option) and a file to be appended (-a).  According to the docs,
	the recommended permissions for the wrapper are 775, world executable,
	which will allow a malicious user to execute
	
	% /usr/local/mail/majordomo-1.92/wrapper archive2.pl -f
	some-majordomo-program -a file-with-hacker-text-to-append
	
	This allows him to append perl code to majordomo (for example) to be
	later executed with wrapper permissions.

	* test: A file to test for uid/gid setting under the wrapper

	* Makefile:
	Set up for posix/solaris 2.x build at IDD. Also cleaned up some bogus
	non empty lines.

	* README:
	Added comments section at the top of the README describing the changes
	including the license file and the fixed from 1.92.

	* wrapper.c:
	Added a cast to shut up gcc, and added a setgroups call to clobber all
	group memberships from sendmail. This only works for POSIX where the
	euid is root.

	* sample.cf: added required @archive_dirs array.

	* resend: Changed copyright notice.
	
	Quoted @ signs. Replaced open() class with calls to open_temp that
	should reduce the chances of a bad person exploiting a race condition
	between the existance test and the open.  I also changed dies to
	aborts so people are notified, also I labeled the different abort
	messages so that identical messages can be differentiated.
	
	I added better/smarter admiistrivia checks especially making a better
	help filter.
	
	Fixed the unlink glob failure bug that was introduced in the 1.92 release.

	* request-answer: Quoted @ signs for perl5.

	* medit: Changed copyright notice.

	* majordomo_version.pl:
	Version 1.93beta1. Here's hoping we don't run out of version numbers before
	2.0 is released.

	* majordomo.pl:
	Added the function main'open_temp which is a function that will open
	temporary files trying to make certain that the opened file is a new
	file and not a file that is already in existance. The only side effect
	is that the file that is opened (by somebody attempting to fool the
	open function) may have its atime updated.

	* majordomo.cf:
	Added @archive_dir and converted for use at dstar.iddis.com.

	* majordomo:
	Changed the copyright notice, and quoted the @ sign for perl5.

	* config_parse.pl:
	Quoted @ signs and $ signs in strings or patterns for perl5. Also
	added the characters @ and ! as being valid for regular expressions
	for advertize and noadvertize.

	* bounce-remind: Quoted @ signs in strings for perl5.

	* approve:
	Removed ~/.majordomo glob which didn't work under perl5, and replaced
	it with $ENV{HOME}. I also turned mail into /usr/ucb/mail so the -s
	flag always (I hope) makes sense.

	* LICENSE: the license for majordomo use

Thu June 6 15:50:23 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)
        * 
	Updated files to report version 1.92 release
	*
	Added code to handle two types of Security problems caused by 
	using putting from line. Sendmail is now invoked using -t flag
	when to address is derived from the From line. Sendmaiil is
	exec'ed after perl forks rather than opening directly with
     	open, from lines with a - sign at the front of the address are
     	bounced as hostile addresses.

Mon May  9 17:16:52 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* ALL
	released version 1.90 of majordomo

	* Makefile:
	added -f to rm so it always completes sucessfully for the distclean
	target.

	* README:
	Added comments about the list membership advertize feature that always
	lists any list you are subscribed to.

	* Makefile:
	added specific archive install targets, added distribution target, moved all install targets together

	* digest: Added code to smash list name tolowercase.

Sun May  8 22:28:49 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* README:
	Added comments about making sure that digest has its archive and
	incoming directories created

	* majordomo:
	Set up help function to use $majordomo_receive to properly tailor the
	help message.

	* sample.cf:
	documented that majordomo_receive is also used to determine the help
	text that is sent.

	* sample.aliases: Lowercased Sample list for -l flag to resend

	* README:
	Documented need for /etc/majordomo.cf so that medit will work.
	Documented that the value for the -l flag to resend should be all
	lower case.

	* resend:
	Added code to smash case of list name specified with -l option since
	$opt_l was passed off directly to config_parse.pl, and majordomo
	always smashed case on lists when creating them.

	* medit: Changed default majordomo.cf location to /etc/majordomo.cf

	* README:
	Fixed some typos and expanded on perl version information, and made
	some constructs parallel. Updated thanks list to include Jerry Peek.

Sun May  8 02:32:59 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* config_parse.pl:
	Fixed up a bit more debugging cruft to stdout. Now it check the debug
	flag before printing errors.

	* digest: Fixed bug in file limiting code.

Sat May  7 22:09:17 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* majordomo:
	Changed we're to we are to get around bug in emacs perl mode.
	
	Also changed all occurances of:
	     if ( (!$list) || ! ($clean_list = &valid_list($listdir, $list))) {
	to
	     if ( ((!$list) || ! ($clean_list = &valid_list($listdir, $list)))
		&& defined($deflist)) {
	
	This makes error work properly when a request like:
	
		subscribe rouilj@cs.umb.edu
	
	is made to a majordomo running without the -l flag.
	
	Also any error in newinfo or in newconfig causes all text to be eaten
	up to the trailing EOF statement so that here text isn't accidnetly
	executed.

	* digest:
	Added code to only include files with the name [0-9]* in a digest.
	It warns if there are files that aren't supposed to be in the
	incomming directory.

	* config_parse.pl:
	made grab_absolute_file and grab_absolute_dir to be no ops.

	* README: Removed section on global indexing of majordomo

	* config_parse.pl: fixed formatting

	* majordomo.cf: Fixed comment formatting.

	* Makefile:
	Removed unused install target. Added explicit shell setting. Split
	install-scripts into install-scripts and install-cf. Install-cf
	installs ./majordomo.cf or ./sample.cf if majordomo.cf doesn't exist
	as the $W_BIN/majordomo.cf. Added dist-clean target for use by cvs to
	clean up stuff when checking out majordomo-dist.

	* sample.cf: updated to match current majordomo.cf

	* config_parse.pl:
	Added debug print supression to making defaults announcement.

	Added comments about the 1.90 cognizant version of the majordomo
	chapter being done and becoming available via ftp in due time.

	* resend:
	Fixed bug that prevented addministrivia checks from functioning. Hey
	lets hear it for regression suites. If I'd let this one slip out
	again, I would never have heard the end of it.

	* README: Added info blurb about gloal indexing

Fri May  6 18:23:48 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@cs.umb.edu)

	* majordomo_version.pl:
	Upgraded version identfier from 1.90b2 to 1.90. I won't miss this
	again 8-).

	* majordomo.cf, majordomo:
	The -l flag enhancements weren't quite right. There was no variable
	that could be used to turn off the unsubscription information for
	using the -request address. The majordomo config file majordomo.cf now
	sports a majordomo_request variable that will enable the -request help
	messages. By default the variable's value is 0 which supresses the
	help message.

	* config_parse.pl: changed debug value to 0.

Thu May  5 20:28:54 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@cs.umb.edu)

	lines in its input.

	* makeindex.pl: Fixed syntax problem for 4.019 perl.

	* makeindex.pl, logsummary.pl:
	some neat program from Paul close inital checkin.

	* resend:
	Made Getopts failure message say that getopts failed but the error
	produced is still cryptic. It doesn't look like getopts returns a real
	error for a missing required argument..

Thu Apr 21 16:56:57 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@cs.umb.edu)

	* README: Documentation changes to make thing clearer.

	* majordomo.cf:
	Added comments stating that @safedirs is essentially a no op.

	* majordomo:
	Commented out setting of PATH in majordomo since the wraper does it
	already, and the wrapper is easily customizable in the makefile.

	* README:
	Changed location of text that discussed the -l option to majordomo.
	Added comment about moving archive2.pl from its install area in Tools
	to the top level majordomo directory if you want to use it.

Sun Apr 17 20:07:00 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@cs.umb.edu)

	* resend:
	Fixed a bug when moderated and restricted posting (-I) options are
	used together. I moved the code that bounces non-approved submissions
	to moderated lists after the code that checks to see if the persion is
	allowed to send email. Now if a message comes in to a -I/-A list, it
	will be checked to see if the person is on the approved posting list.
	If not, then the message will be bounced with "Non member submission".
	If the person is allowed to submit, but they didn't provide the
	approval password, the you get an "Approval Required" message.

Thu Apr 14 06:49:10 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@cs.umb.edu)

	fronter and footers.

	* config_parse.pl: Added default value for message length at 40000.

Mon Mar 14 18:40:25 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* config_parse.pl, README:
	Fixed typos that Brent Chapman sent me with the README file. I fixed
	the corresponding spelling mistakes in the config_parse.pl file so
	that the mistakes aren't propigated into the config files.

	* resend, approve:
	Added patches from Brent Chapman for bug fixes to 1.62 that I had not
	integrated.
	
	(Brent) I pulled over 1.90b1 and integrated the changes I'd made to
	Majordomo since 1.62 that you hadn't already made.  Basicly, there
	were 3 minor bug fixes:
	
	Fixed a minor bug in "approve": it was using the "mail" program
	in some places
	and the "Mail" program in others, but now consistently uses "mail".
	
	Fixed a minor bug in "resend" that was causing it to try and validate
	"Approved:" headers anywhere in the body of a message, instead of just
	in the first line of the body, if the "-M" argument was not set.
	
	Fixed handling of "-I" argument to "resend", so that it would squawk
	if a "-I" argument file couldn't be found, and so that $listdir is prepended
	to the arguments only if they aren't already absolute path names (i.e.,
	only if they don't already begin with "/").
	
	Here are diffs for "approve" and "resend".  I have NOT tested these
	yet, but the patches were pretty simple so they'll probably be OK.

	* README: changed install directions to confiorm to makefile changes

	* Makefile:
	fixed filename references and reduced amount of root installion requirement

	* wrapper.sh: fixed varible refernce

	* majordomo.cf:
	Added code to use the HOME environment variable defined by the wrapper
	to set $homedir.

Mon Mar  7 20:57:12 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* README: ran though ispell

	* majordomo_version.pl: updated version string

	Obsoleted split_archive.pl in favor of brent's archive2.pl program.
	
	Makefile:
	  modified to use contrib directory to copy archive2.pl from. Also

		'digest_archive' 'digest_rm_footer' 'digest_rm_fronter'
	
	   All comments have removed references to command line flags.
		to make this true, the command line flags will have
		to be removed, but that will be the case for new installations.
	
	   subject_prefix commeent talks about duplicate supression.
	
	   changed &mk_default_config to &writeconfig
		increased size of key in comments section
	
	   fixed bug in '-' escape handling that resulted in incorrect reverse
		escaping.
	
	   grab_absolute_dir now uses key in error messages. Empty directory no
		longer an error.
	
	majordomo:
	
		$main'main_program is set to mj_majordomo
	
		add some sanity checking for majordomo.cf file.
	
		added mkdigest command to drive digest creation

		fixed format of some help messages to allow them to stay less
		 than 80 characters per line.
	
	resend:
	
		set $main'main_program to mj_resend

	Merged in changes to support a -l argument to majordomo from R. Gary
	Cutbill rgary@x.org. If majordomo is run at the request address with
	the -l <listname> argument, then the list name is optional in
	majordomo commands.

Fri Feb 18 04:58:42 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* resend:
	Fixed bug that resulted in subject tag not being applied where it
	should have been because the regular expression that eliminates
	subject tag application if the tag already exists didn't have its non
	alphanumeric characters escaped resulting in misinterpreted regular
	expressions.

Thu Feb 17 20:02:32 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	Added check so that the subject_prefix is put onto the front of the
	subject line if and only if it hasn't been found in the subject line
	already. This should prevent subject lines like:
	
		Subject: [list] Re: [list] foo bar baz
	
	This also enables preservation of Re: by mailers so that they don't
	add more stupid Re:'s at the beginning of the subject.

Tue Feb  8 00:11:53 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* Changelog: fixed line breaks

	* config_parse.pl:
	added to man page, and moved known_keys nearer to top of file

Mon Feb 7 22:51:04 1993  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)
	* RELEASE OF 1.62 CONFIG BETA 3

Mon Feb  7 20:37:32 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* majordomo.pl, majordomo:
	Added code to allow "\ " to escape a space in the majordomo command
	line. Also added " " as a valid character in the filename.

Sun Jan 30 04:31:00 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* resend:
	Added & to sendmail command that calls the actual list distribution
	address. This should help to alleviate some of the memory thrashing
	that goes on with resend by colapsing the sendmail -> resend ->
	sendmail to the final sendmail since the first sensmail, and the
	resend will exit.

Fri Jan 28 15:48:02 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* majordomo:
	added code so that a list is displayed if the person is on it

	* majordomo: increased width of description to 56

	* majordomo: decreased list output indentation to 2 spaces

	* majordomo:
	fixed width of description at 55 characters to prevent lines > 80 characters in list output

	* majordomo, config_parse.pl:
	Added code that changes the sender of the welcome message generated in
	response to a subscribe command to be the sender of the list that is
	subscribed to. This will do some nice things like alerting the list
	manager to bogus addresses on the list. It will also supress the
	annoying message that I get when I subscribe somebody to the bounces
	mailing list. I know that the address I put on bounces is
	undeliverable, why do you think I put it on bounces 8-).

	* majordomo:
	first cut at geting bounced welcome messages to go to the list owner rather than
	 majordomo-owner

Wed Jan 26 01:24:35 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* Makefile: added deletion of *~ to clean target

	* resend: reformatted comment and reordered test for subject_prefix

Tue Jan 25 20:58:12 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* majordomo: logging for create list if successful added

	* majordomo: fixed lack of log for successful writeconfig

	* majordomo:
	Added do_digest and ccreate list code (using external programs) to majordomo

Mon Jan 24 19:45:41 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* majordomo.pl:
	added local(diff) to is_member per patch from brent chapman

Sat Jan 22 21:15:52 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* config_parse.pl:
	Fixed spelling typo and rewrote doc string for mungedomain.

	* resend, config_parse.pl:
	The subject_prefix keyword is now expanded the same as header, footer,
	fronter etc. Doc string has been changed to reflect this.

	* majordomo.pl:
	Changed the mechanism by which I got the name of the list. The local
	parameter $clean_list is now used rather than $mail'clean_list which
	doesn't exit.

	* majordomo.pl:
	Changed the order of the parameters to addr_match so that mungedomain
	comparison worked properly. It looks for arg2 to be a changed version
	of arg1.

	* config_parse.pl, majordomo.cf:
	Fixed default archive directory specification to include listname. I
	also made it properly pass configuration checks.

	* majordomo.pl, config_parse.pl:
	Added code that applies the mungdomain logic to all of the private_
	options.  I also changed the documentation to reflect that fact.

	* config_parse.pl:
	Changed top explanatory text for config file to make use of - sign
	correctly explained.
	
	Fixed code that eliminates \001's in regexp_arrays.
	
	Fixed code that interprets - sign escapes in string_arrays.

Fri Jan 21 02:11:13 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* config_parse.pl:
	Fixed a bug where expansion tokens in the explanatory test were being
	expanded out of existance.
	
	Added fix for an obscure bug dealing with directory specifcation and
	$list having a .new at the end.
	
	Made some commentary more explanatory, and fixed a few errors.
	
	Added code to allow - signs to have three functions in a here document:
	
	    To embed a blank line in the here document, put a '-' as the first
	      and ONLY character on the line.
	    To preserve whitespace at the beginning of a line, put a - on the
	      line before the whitespace to be preserved
	    To put a literal '-' at the beginning of a line, double it.



Fri Jan  7 09:01:01 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)
	* RELEASE OF 1.62 CONFIG BETA 2

Fri Jan  7 05:23:35 1994  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* majordomo:
	Added code that implements a simple line continuation character. Using
	\ as the last non whitespace character on the line causes the
	following line to be added to the current command string. One bug,
	when the command is printed out, it is all printed on one line, and
	not as the sender typed it.

	* resend, config_parse.pl:
	Added the ability to prepend a word to the subject line. Uses the
	config file parameter subject_prefix. This is useful for those reading
	mailing list mail using mailers that can sort messages by subject
	only.

Fri Dec 10 11:51:04 1993  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)
	* RELEASE OF 1.62 CONFIG BETA 1

Thu Dec  9 06:54:30 1993  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* regress.t04, regress.t03, regress.t02, regress.t01, regress.e04,
        regress.e03,
	regress.e02, regress.e01, regress.t05, regress, rcmp:
	the started regression suite

	* README.CONFIG: added coment about tailoring %known_values

	* config_parse.pl:
	cleaned up some documentaion, and cleaned the code a bit too.
	No functional chnages

	* README.CONFIG: first cut of readme file

	* resend:
	fixed tail recursion problem that stopped final line from being
        \n terminated in message_fronter

	* resend, majordomo, config_parse.pl:
	Removed getconfig_password. If they can getthe config file, then they
	can get the admin password. Not really smart.
	
	Added message_fronter option. This text is prepended to the message
        body.
	
	Added a man page describing the config_opts interface somewhat to
	config_opts.pl.

Wed Dec  8 07:07:47 1993  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* config_parse.pl: enhanced docs for headers and footers

	* resend, config_parse.pl:
	Changed blank line equivalence character to be a '-' standing alone on
	the line. The inital . played havoc with sendmail, since sendmail
	exited once it saw the ., and I didn't want to play around with
	doubling the dot etc. Besides, that would have made updating the
	config file by editing the one received via mail impossible.
	
	I also have expansion operating correctly now. The substitution is
	being done in resend rather than in the config file code. Also, I
	removed an optimization that prevented scanning for ^from lines unless
	the -I option was used. Now that this optiminbzation is gone, $sender
	processing works fine.

	* Makefile: changes for development installation.

	* majordomo, config_parse.pl:
	Normalized all options names. _ is the seperator of choice. Added
	message_footer and message_headers keywords. This also required that I
	implement a blank line equivalence. A single period sitting alone on a
	line creates a blank line in the output. This single period is
	recreated by writeconfig.
	
	A hidden file is now equivelent to noadvertize = /.*/;
	
	Created the function substitute_values that replaces strings in text
	context.
	
	Added get_config code for do_approve and do_passwd.
	
	Parens were added to the unlink command to have it do the right thing.

	* majordomo.cf: changes for development path

	* majordomo_version.pl: version id 1.62Dev development

	* resend:
	Added code to allow header and footer generation. The headers and
	footers are ocuring in the message properly, but the range of textual
	substitutions that I wanted isn't the best. The config code is called
	and substitution is done before any of the headers from the message
	are parsed. Thus things like sender, subject etc are not available to
	me for substitution in the header and footer text.
	
	Solving this problem may require a rewrite of the logic of resend. I
	don't relish the thought. Alternatively, I could try to find a way to
	do delayed expansion of tokens. Actually this might work. I can expand
	the template at the time I actually use the template. Hmm, I'll think
	about it tonite.

Thu Nov 25 07:09:16 1993  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* majordomo:
	The keyword subscribe_policy was being incorrectly checked for as
	subscribe-policy, thus all closes/auto functions were broken. I have
	changed the occurances of subscribe-policy to subscribe_policy to fix
	the problem. I also need to reconsile all of the keywords so they use
	either a - or an _. This mixed seperator stuff is for the birds.

Wed Nov 24 00:00:32 1993  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* majordomo_version.pl, majordomo.cf, Makefile:
	Changes to allow a straight make in the /tools/majordomo-1.62_config
	directory.  Makefile modified to set up following tree:
	
	 (root is W_BIN below)
	    root -+--          -- actual majordomo scripts, libraries etc
	          +-- wrappers -- executable wrappers and wrapper shellscript
		   +-- Tools    -- tools like split archive and digest
		   +-- bin      -- user level tools, approve, bounce etc
		   +-- man      -- man pages
	
	This is the tree I will be working with. also added make
	permissions-shared to minimize anount of code that was to be run as
	root.
	
	Version changed to be 1.62C, and majordomo.cf changed to point to
	correct homedir.

Tue Nov 23 23:51:40 1993  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* config_parse.pl:
	Changed mk_default_config to use END as the delimiter for array value
	specifications so that EOF doen't conflict with the use of EOF in
	newconfig.

	* bounce-remind: changed Bounces to bounces.

Fri Nov 19 17:48:38 1993  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* majordomo: fixed date stamp on info file

Thu Nov 18 23:53:35 1993  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* config_parse.pl:
	Changed mk_default_config so that it is now a two stage process using
	an intermediate file, rather than forking and postprocessing the input
	using the child process. When forking, I was having all sorts of
	problems with the parent's STDIN getting mixed into the child's STDIN
	producing garbage. Now an intermedaite file (listname.config.out) is
	used to hold the text. The text is then read in, and comment
	characters, and a header is added when necessary. This is output
	to listname.config, and the temporary file listname.config.out is
        removed.

	* Makefile: added existance tests for directories before creating them

	* config_parse.pl: Added support for array and enumerated types.
	
	Arrays are specified using the
	
	name << EOZ
	value1
	value 2
	EOZ
	
	syntax.
	
	Also enhanced the commentary code.
	
	Added debugging levels and options.
	
	Added hooks for allowing incremental specification of a config file.

	* Makefile: added install shared and a couple of other targets.

	* majordomo.cf: added safedirs for locations of archives

	* majordomo:
	Changed last of config_opt{} references to use ',' instaed of '.'.
	
	Added support for advertize/noadvertize being array's of regexps.
	
	Added file handle flushing for REPLY filehandle to try to get around
	an intermix problem.
	
	Added subscribe policy as a token rather than open, closed, or auto
	keys.
	
	Added writeconfig keyword and fucntion that writes the configuration
	file out as it is held in the config_opts array.
	
	Converted cf_bool (old style) to cf_ck_bool.

	* majordomo.pl:
	Fixed bug with multiple index concatenation in %config_opts{} with
	admin_passwd. Also added a patch from Brent that fixes a filehandle
	bug that sometimes truncated the mailing list.

Thu Nov 11 21:13:48 1993  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* resend: updated to version 1.19 of resend

Tue Nov  9 20:08:08 1993  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* resend:
	added administrivia check for subject 'request .* addition', also
	changed option parse code cf_check() to cf_check_bool(), and multiple
	indicies for $config_opts rather than concatenated string.

Tue Nov  2 19:23:09 1993  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* approve: 1.62 merger

Fri Sep 10 04:14:08 1993  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* regress.test, regress.out: moved regress tests to a subdirectory

	* majordomo.cf, majordomo:
	added code to put 40 characters of the request subject line into
         the reply subject line

	* majordomo:
	fix for bug that prevents which from working for private lists

Thu Sep  9 23:08:05 1993  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* config_parse.pl:
	Fully table driven. With a parse table, known keyword/default value
	table, comment table, and subsystem table. A default value beginning
	with #! is eval'ed so that custom values can be created.
	
	There is a new function to create the default config file.  The
	function could be called at any point since it will preserve the data
	values. However, it does totally rewrite the comments in the config
	file.
	
	The private keyword was causing headaches with its positional nature.
	It is no longer supported. The file <listname>.private is still
	available however. Also the password fields are no longer allowed to
	specify password files. Their values set the pass phrase or password.
	Also, the password in <listname>.passwd is always recognized.
	
	The new_keyword function takes 5 args:
	
	  keyword, default value, parse function, subsystem [comments]
	
	The comments are optional.

	* majordomo:
	Added a select call to make the REPLY file handle flush immediately
	when lists are called. This prevents multiple headers when the fork
	call in mk_default_config occurs.
	
	Also changed x-private to private-x, and removed the private keyword.
	
	Also print reason for dying in eval of majordomo.cf.

	* majordomo.cf:
	added umask call to set proper protections on config file

	* resend:
	Changed code so that a null value for a config parameter is checked
	for rather than a defined value. Added a call to the approve code so
	that the approve, admin, and <listname>.passwd values are all accepted
	for article approval.

	* majordomo: added chdir to move back to  after index command

	* majordomo.pl, majordomo, config_parse.pl:
	Basic fully table driven config file, with interface

Sun Sep  5 07:54:06 1993  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* majordomo, config_parse.pl:
	performance enhancements, passwd detainting secured,
        and advertize/noadvertize operate against pure machine address now

	patched approve to accept from stdin, fixed buglet with grab_word
        in config_parse.pl, and added date_info to default template

          Changes,
        majordomo_version.pl:
	version 1.60 of majordomo: additonal helps for moderated lists,
        and fix for verion id bug

	* majordomo_version.pl: Initial revision

	* Manifest:
	version 1.60 of majordomo: additonal helps for moderated lists,
        and fix for verion id bug

Wed Sep  1 20:37:49 1993  John P. Rouillard  (rouilj@terminus.cs.umb.edu)

	* archive.pl: Contributed archive program

	* wrapper.sh, resend, request-answer, regress.test, new-list, medit,
          majordomo.pl,
