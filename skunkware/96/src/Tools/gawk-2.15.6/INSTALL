These are minimal instructions for installing gawk on a Unix system.
Full instructions for installing and porting gawk are given in Chapter 16
of the manual.

1. Look in the `config' directory for a file that is appropriate to your
   Unix system.  For example, use `ultrix41' for Ultrix 4.1 or later, and
   `sunos41' for SunOS 4.1.x.

2. Type
	./configure FILE
   where FILE is the name you chose earlier.

3. Type
	make
   This should build gawk.

4. Type
	make -n install
   to see where things will be installed by default. Edit the Makefile to
   change these defaults if they are not appropriate to your system. Then
   type
	make install
   to install gawk.

If you don't have GCC, or if your Unix version is not close enough to one
of the ones in the `config' directory, then you will need to do more work;
see the manual.

The next major release of gawk will use GNU Autoconf; the installation
instructions will change then.
