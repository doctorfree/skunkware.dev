     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          <EM>Vat</EM> allows users to conduct host-to-host or multihost  audio
          teleconferences  over  an  internet  (multihost  conferences
          require that the kernel  support  IP  multicast).   On  most
          systems,  no  hardware other than a microphone is required -
          sound I/O is  via  the  built-in  audio  hardware.   On  DEC
          systems, an AudioFile server must be running.

          The conference is carried out on the  address  specified  by
          <EM>dest</EM>.  Point-to-point conferences are initiated by supplying
          a standard IP address, while multiparty  conferences  use  a
          Class D group address.  <EM>Port</EM> specifies the UDP ports to use,
          and <EM>ttl</EM> specifies the IP  time-to-live  (see  below).   <EM>Port</EM>
          specifies  two  consecutive  ports, one for data and one for
          control.  The data port is set to the greatest even  integer
          less  than or equal to <EM>port</EM>. The control port is one greater
          than the data port.


     <STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
          (Note that all the parameters set by the following flags can
          also   be   controlled   by  X  resources  (which  all  have
          `reasonable' defaults) so one should not need  to  give  <EM>vat</EM>
          any  flags  in  the  usual  case.   The  flags only exist to
          temporarily override some resource.)

          <STRONG>-a</STRONG>   Enable automatic gain control on the output (speaker).

          <STRONG>-A</STRONG>   Enable automatic gain control on the input (mike).

          <STRONG>-c</STRONG>   Start up in `conference mode' (see description  below).
               (This flag is the opposite of <STRONG>-l</STRONG>.)

          <STRONG>-C</STRONG>   Use <EM>conference</EM> as the title of this vat window.  If  no
               -C  flag is given, the destination address and port are
               used as the window title.

          <STRONG>-d</STRONG>   Start up with the  VU  meters  disabled  (this  can  be
               changed  using  the  <STRONG>`Disable</STRONG>  <STRONG>Meters'</STRONG>  checkbox on the
               auxiliary controls panel).

          <STRONG>-E</STRONG>   Include a checkbox in the auxiliary controls panel  for
               specifying  that  echo  cancellation is being performed
               externally (i.e., in hardware).  This option  can  also
               be    effected    by    setting    the    X    resource
               <EM>Vat.externalEchoCancel</EM> to ``true''.

          <STRONG>-f</STRONG>   Sets the output audio packet format to <EM>fmt</EM>. (Note  that
               it  not necessary to set an input format since vat will
               accept <EM>any</EM> packet format it  knows  about.)   Currently
               available audio formats are:
                    pcm  78Kb/s 8-bit mu-law encoded 8KHz PCM (20ms frames)
                    pcm2 71Kb/s 8-bit mu-law encoded 8KHz PCM (40ms frames)
                    pcm4 68Kb/s 8-bit mu-law encoded 8KHz PCM (80ms frames)
                    dvi  46Kb/s Intel DVI ADPCM (20ms frames)
                    dvi2 39Kb/s Intel DVI ADPCM (40ms frames)
                    dvi4 36Kb/s Intel DVI ADPCM (80ms frames)
                    gsm  17Kb/s GSM (80ms frames)
                    lpc4 9Kb/s Linear Predictive Coder (80ms frames)
               (The <EM>dvi</EM> encoding was contributed  by  Jack  Jansen  of
               CWI.   The <EM>gsm</EM> coder was contributed by Carsten Bormann
               of the Technische Universitaet Berlin.  The  <EM>lpc</EM>  coder
               was contributed by Ron Frederick of Xerox PARC.)
9               The  default  audio  format  can  be   set   with   the
               <EM>audioFormat</EM> X resource.  It defaults to <STRONG>pcm.</STRONG>

          <STRONG>-g</STRONG>   Override the default  window  geometry  with  <EM>geometry</EM>,
               which should be a standard X geometry string.

          <STRONG>-I</STRONG>   Use the ``LBL Conference Bus'' to interact  with  other
               multimedia   conferencing  tools.   The  small  integer
               <EM>channel</EM>, which must be non-zero, is used as the channel
               identifier  for group interprocess communication on the
               local host.  This value  should  be  consistent  across
               each  group  of  applications  that  belong to a single
               conference, and should be  unique  across  conferences.
               The   session   directory   tool   (sd)  will  allocate
               appropriate values.  (<EM>Vic</EM> and <EM>vat</EM>  currently  use  this
               mechanism to coordinate voice-activated video switching
               as well as other conference control abstractions.)

          <STRONG>-j</STRONG>   Start up with audio output to the external audio  jack.
               This  flag  can  be defaulted by setting the X resource
               <EM>Vat.outputPort</EM> to <EM>Jack</EM>.

          <STRONG>-J</STRONG>   Start up with audio output muted.

          <STRONG>-k</STRONG>   Keep  all  sites  in  the  `Conference  Hosts'   panel.
               Normally  sites  that  exit are deleted from the panel.
               With  <STRONG>-k,</STRONG>  sites  that  exit  are  grayed-out  but  not
               deleted.

9

          <STRONG>-l</STRONG>   Start up in `lecture  mode'  (see  description  below).
               This  flag  can  be defaulted by setting the X resource
               <EM>Vat.lectureMode</EM> to true.

          <STRONG>-M</STRONG>   Start up with audio input unmuted.

          <STRONG>-N</STRONG>   Use <EM>session</EM>, in lieu of your user name and local  host,
               to  identify  you  to  other  sites.   If no -N flag is
               given, the X resource Vat.sessionName is used.

          <STRONG>-n</STRONG>   Use  a  packet  format  that  is  compatible  with  the
               obsolete vat protocol, used by version 3 and earlier of
               vat.

          <STRONG>-P</STRONG>   Use  <EM>priority</EM>  as  this  vat  window's   priority   for
               obtaining  the  audio  device.   All vat windows have a
               priority which is  typically  set  by  the  X  resource
               Vat.defaultPriority  (defaults  to 100) but this can be
               overridden by a <STRONG>-P</STRONG> flag.   If  a  window  requests  the
               audio (because new network data arrived or the mike has
               been unmuted) and  the  window  currently  holding  the
               audio  is  either  lower  priority,  the  audio  holder
               immediately gives it up.  Otherwise  the  new  window's
               request is ignored.

          <STRONG>-R</STRONG>   Disable the mike controls in the user-interface.   This
               prevents   the   user   from   enabling  the  mike  and
               transmitting audio to the session.

          <STRONG>-s</STRONG>   Start up with audio output  to  the  internal  speaker.
               (This flag is the opposite of <STRONG>-j</STRONG>.)

          <STRONG>-S</STRONG>   Make new sites come up `suppressed' (the check box next
               to  the  sitename  will be checked and you will have to
               click on it to hear the  site  speak).   This  flag  is
               intended  for something like meeting audiocasts where a
               moderator wants to have control over  who  is  able  to
               speak.    This   flag   can   also   be   set   by  the
               Vat.muteNewSites X resource.

          <STRONG>-t</STRONG>   Set the multicast ttl (time-to-live) to <EM>ttl</EM>.  (The  ttl
               is  ignored  if  the  destination  address is not an IP
               multicast address.)  If no -t flag is given, the  value
               of the X resource <EM>Vat.defaultTTL</EM> is used.

          <STRONG>-U</STRONG>   Use the unix-domain stream socket specified  by  <EM>socket</EM>
               for  audio I/O.  Some process should bind to and listen
               on this socket before vat is run.  The data is raw 8khz
               mulaw  samples.   If <EM>socket</EM> is a number, then AudioFile
               is  used.   The  number  indicates  the   corresponding


          <STRONG>-u</STRONG>   Source <EM>script</EM>, in addition to the  compiled-in  script,
               to build the user interface.  You can provide addtional
               tcl code that is loaded at startup in $HOME/.vat.tcl.

          <STRONG>-X</STRONG>   Override the X resource Vat.<EM>resource</EM> with <EM>value</EM>.


     <STRONG>VAT</STRONG> <STRONG>OPERATION</STRONG>
          Note:  In addition to invoking the ``quit''  button,  typing
          `q',  `Q',  ctrl-C  or  ctrl-D  anywhere  in the window will
          terminate <EM>vat</EM>.

          The <EM>vat</EM> window is divided into  two  parts:  the  right  has
          controls  for  the  local  audio  and  the left has a status
          display of the remote users  participating  in  the  current
          conference.   The audio controls consist of two sliders that
          control the mike and  playback  gain,  a  button  to  toggle
          output  between the built in speaker and the headphone jack,
          buttons to enable/disable either the mike  or  speaker,  and
          buttons  to  control acquistion of the audio hardware.  Just
          to the left of each slider is a VU meter.  A rule  of  thumb
          is  to  adjust the mike and speaker gain sliders so the peak
          readings on the meter are about 80% of full scale.

          To change the audio output line (i.e.,  speaker,  headphone,
          lineout,  etc.)  click on the speaker icon (it should change
          to a headphone icon).  Additional  clicks  will  round-robin
          among the available lines.  If there is only one option, the
          button will be disabled.  Similarly, click on the mike  icon
          to  select  among  the  input lines.  By default, vat starts
          with the mike muted and the speaker enabled.   The  mike  is
          active  when  the  ``talk'' button is selected, while output
          can be muted by de-selecting the ``listen'' button.

          The <STRONG>Conference</STRONG> <STRONG>Hosts</STRONG>  window  lists  all  the  remote  users
          participating  in  the  conference.   Each  user's  name  is
          displayed in a box that is highlighted  whenever  that  user
          speaks  and grayed-out if a `session' message from that user
          hasn't been received for at  least  30  seconds  (vat  sends
          `session'  message  every so often) - this usually indicates
          that the site has lost connectivity or  that  vat  has  been
          aborted or stopped.  There is a checkbox to the left of each
          participant name.  Clicking on the box will cause audio from
          that  participant  to  be  discarded  instead of played (for
          example, this might be used  to  suppress  a  site  that  is
          generating echoes).

     <STRONG>Multiple</STRONG> <STRONG>VAT</STRONG> <STRONG>Windows</STRONG>
          One host can be running an arbitrary number of vat  sessions
          (presumably with different destination addresses).  However,

          only  one  of those sessions will be able to access the mike
          and speaker.  For the  most  part,  the  vat  sessions  will
          automatically follow the action.  If you select the ``talk''
          button or press ``Keep Audio'' button, the audio device will
          be  acquired by that session and the session that previously
          held the audio will relinquish it.  Vat displays it's  title
          bar in an oblique font when the audio is not being held.

          A vat session will also acquire the audio if there is  input
          from  the  network.  But to prevent a background vat session
          from stealing the audio from the foreground session, you can
          toggle  the  ``Keep Audio'' button.  When the ``Keep Audio''
          button is selected, vat will reliquish  the  audio  only  if
          there is a user demand in another window (i.e., unmuting the
          mike or selecting the ``Keep Audio'' button).

          Participants in a multi-site conference often want  to  have
          `side  conversations'  that  don't  bother  the  rest of the
          conference  participants.   Vat   has   some   support   for
          establishing  side conversations: If you middle-click on the
          name of some site in the conference hosts window, a new  vat
          window  will  be created that talks only to that participant
          (it sends unicast datagrams rather than multicast).  If that
          other  participant  also middle-clicks on your site, you can
          have a private conversation  between  just  your  two  sites
          using  the newly created vat windows.  Note:  due to a `bug'
          in the way most systems implement multicast, if you create a
          new  window  aimed  at  a  particular  participant  but they
          haven't created a window aimed at you, they  will  hear  you
          speaking  in  the main conference window and may not realize
          that  your  audio  is  being  sent  only  to  them  and  not
          multicast.   One  can  view  this  either  as  a feature (it
          provides a semi-private channel you can use to  ask  someone
          to  set  up a side conversation) or a bug (it often leads to
          strange, one-sided conversations where one  side  multicasts
          and the other doesn't).

     <STRONG>Auxiliary</STRONG> <STRONG>Controls</STRONG>
          Clicking on the ``Menu'' label at  the  bottom  of  the  <EM>vat</EM>
          window will cause a panel of <STRONG>auxiliary</STRONG> <STRONG>controls</STRONG> to open.

          The <STRONG>Audio</STRONG> <STRONG>Tests</STRONG> buttons will enable some audio  test  modes.
          These  should  <EM>not</EM>  be  selected  during  a conference.  The
          <STRONG>loopback</STRONG> <STRONG>mike</STRONG> button will cause input from the  mike  to  be
          sent  to  the  local speaker/jack.  This might be useful for
          checking levels and debugging cable problems  but  the  20ms
          delay from input to output makes talking in this mode almost
          impossible.  The three tone buttons  will  generate  one  of
          three  reference  tones  through  the  local speaker.  Level
          setting should generally be done with the -6dBm tone.


          feedback/echo  from  the mike to the speaker.  In <STRONG>mike</STRONG> <STRONG>mutes</STRONG>
          <STRONG>net</STRONG> mode, vat will mute the speaker whenever it thinks  that
          you are talking, while in <STRONG>net</STRONG> <STRONG>mutes</STRONG> <STRONG>mike</STRONG> mode, vat will mute
          the mike whenever input from the network arrives.   In  <STRONG>full</STRONG>
          <STRONG>duplex</STRONG>  mode, vat will assume that feedback can't happen and
          do nothing to avoid it.   In  <STRONG>echo</STRONG>  <STRONG>cancel</STRONG>  mode,  vat  will
          attempt  to  eliminate  echoes  by  doing  some fancy signal
          processing.  (EchoCancel requires the BSD sound driver -  it
          is  disabled  when  running vat under Sun OS because the Sun
          driver does not provide  any  mechanism  to  time  correlate
          audio  output  and input.)  The internal speaker should only
          be used in `speakerphone' or `echo cancel' mode -  selecting
          `headphone' mode for it will result in your site injecting a
          lot of unpleasant echoes into the conference.  The headphone
          jack  should  be  set  to  `FullDuplex'  mode  if  you  have
          headphones   plugged   into   it   and   `MikeMutesNet'   or
          `EchoCancel'  mode  if  you have an external amp and speaker
          plugged into it.

          There are two <EM>type</EM>-<EM>in</EM> <EM>boxes</EM> (see below) at the bottom of the
          Auxiliary  Controls  panel.   The  one labeled <STRONG>`Name'</STRONG> can be
          used to change the session name announced  to  other  sites.
          The  one labelled <STRONG>`Key'</STRONG> can be used to specify an encryption
          key (see next section).

     <STRONG>Encryption</STRONG>
          (<EM>N.B</EM>.:  <EM>Because</EM>  <EM>of</EM>  <EM>U.S</EM>.  <EM>export</EM>  <EM>controls</EM>,  <EM>the</EM>   <EM>standard</EM>
          <EM>distribution</EM>  <EM>of</EM>  <EM>vat</EM>  <EM>from</EM> <EM>LBL</EM> <EM>does</EM> <EM>not</EM> <EM>support</EM> <EM>encryption</EM>.
          <EM>In</EM> <EM>this</EM> <EM>case</EM>, <EM>the</EM> ``<EM>Key</EM>'' <EM>type</EM>-<EM>in</EM> <EM>box</EM> <EM>will</EM> <EM>be</EM> <EM>disabled</EM>.)

          Since vat conversations are typically conducted over open IP
          networks   there   is   no  way  to  prevent  eavesdropping,
          particularly for multicast conferences.  To add some measure
          of  privacy,  vat  allows the audio packet streams to be DES
          encrypted.  Presumably only sites sharing the same key  will
          be able to decrypt and listen to the encrypted audio.

          Encryption is enabled by entering an arbitrary string in the
          <STRONG>key</STRONG>   box   (this  string  is  the  previously  agreed  upon
          encryption  key  for  the  conference  -   note   that   key
          distribution  should  be done by mechanisms totally separate
          from vat).  Encryption can be turned off by entering a  null
          string (just a carriage return or any string starting with a
          blank) in the <STRONG>key</STRONG> box.

     <STRONG>X</STRONG> <STRONG>Resources</STRONG>
          The  following  are  the  names  and  default  values  of  X
          resources used by <EM>vat</EM>. This list is incomplete.  Consult the
          tcl code in ui-resource.tcl from the vat source distribution
          for the complete set.

          <STRONG>Vat.maxPlayout</STRONG> is the maximum `play out' delay, in  seconds,
          that  can  be  tolerated.   I.e.,  <EM>vat</EM> dynamically adapts to
          delays introduced in the network by delaying the play out of
          a  remote  site's audio packets.  The range of adaptation is
          limited by the size of a buffer in vat  and  this  parameter
          essentially   sets   the   size  of  that  buffer.   Setting
          <STRONG>maxPlayout</STRONG> larger than 10 seconds will probably result  poor
          vat and system behavior.

          Vat has two different modes of adapting the  playout  delay,
          one more suitable for an interactive, multi-party discussion
          or conference and the other more suitable for listening to a
          speech or lecture.  The two modes differ in how quickly they
          `forget' the delay vat  introduces  to  adapt  to  transient
          network  congestion:  In  <EM>Conference</EM>  <EM>mode</EM>  vat  attempts to
          minimize the delay  (since  large  delays  make  interactive
          conversations  difficult)  but  this usually results in more
          lost packets when the delay becomes  too  short  handle  the
          next  congestion  event.   In  <EM>Lecture</EM>  <EM>mode</EM> vat attempts to
          minimize lost packets by reducing delays very slowly.   This
          results  in  the  clearest  playback  but  interactivity may


          <EM>Conference</EM> <EM>mode</EM> is the default when vat starts up unless the
          <STRONG>-l</STRONG>  flag  is  given  or the X resource <EM>lectureMode</EM> is set to
          true.  There are radio buttons in the network section of the
          Auxiliary  Controls  panel  to switch between Conference and
          Lecture

     <STRONG>Statistics</STRONG>
          Clicking on a name with the left mouse button will bring  up
          a  small window of identification information for that user.
          The  window  includes  several  of  the  RTP  identification
          descriptors,  the  audio  format  in  use,  and the times of
          reception of the last data and control  packets.   A  packet
          statistics  window  can  be brought up from the ``Stats...''
          pulldown menu by selecting ``RTP''.  There are three columns
          of  numbers.   The  last  column is the aggregate statistics
          since vat started, while the middle column is the difference
          between  the  last  update  time  and the current time.  The
          first column is an smoother version of  the  middle  column,
          using   an   exponentially   weighted   average   with  gain
          Vat.statTimeConst.

          The statistics are updated every  second  or  so  while  the
          window  is  mapped.   Any  of  values  can be plotted with a
          stripchart by clicking on the name of the desired statistic.

          severely pushed the envelope of vat's capabilities).

     <STRONG>BUGS</STRONG>
          Speakerphone mode is difficult to get right - use a  headset
          if  you  can  (or  run BSD instead of Sun-OS to get a kernel
          audio driver that can support echo  cancellation).   If  you
          have  to  use speakerphone mode, try to position the mike as
          far  as  possible  from  the  speaker  (the  speaker  in   a
          sparcstation  is on bottom of the machine in the front right
          corner near the LED).  If there's a problem with echo (i.e.,
          you  transmit  whenever  other  people  start speaking), try
          reducing the mike gain or mute  the  mike  when  you're  not
          speaking.

          In speakerphone mode <EM>vat</EM> assumes that if there is audio data
          from  the net being sent to the speaker at least part of the
          signal from the mike is pickup from the speaker.  So, unless
          the  mike  signal is `large' compared to the signal from the
          net, <EM>vat</EM> assumes it is echo and suppresses it.   This  means
          that  if  you  want to interrupt someone who is talking, you
          may have to talk a bit louder than usual at the  start  (you
          can  tell  if  you succeed because your site's name box will
          light and the speaker will mute).
