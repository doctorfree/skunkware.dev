<h3><a name=overview>Overview</a></h3>

<p>
The LBNL audio tool, <i>vat</i>, is a real-time, multi-party,
multimedia application
for audio conferencing over the Internet. 
Vat is based on the Draft Internet Standard
<a href=ftp://ftp.isi.edu/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-avt-rtp-07.ps>
Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)</a> developed by the IETF
<a href=http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/html.charters/avt-charter.html>
Audio/Video Transport</a> working group.
RTP is an application-level protocol implemented entirely within
vat -- you need no special system enhancements to run RTP.  Although
vat can be run point-to-point using standard unicast IP addresses,
it is primarily intended as a multiparty conferencing application.
To make use of the conferencing capabilities, your system must support
IP Multicast, and ideally, your network should be connected to the
<a href=http://www.best.com/~prince/techinfo/mbone.html>
IP Multicast Backbone (MBone)</a>. 

<p>
Vat provides only the audio portion of a multimedia conference;
video, whiteboard, and session control tools are implemented as separate
applications.  Our video tool is called
<a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/conferencing/vic/>vic</a>,
our whiteboard tool
<a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/conferencing/wb/>wb</a>,
and our session directory tool
<a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/conferencing/sd/>sd</a>.
Other related applications include ISI's Multimedia Conference Control,
<a href=ftp://ftp.isi.edu/confctrl/mmcc/>mmcc</a>,
the Xerox PARC Network Video tool, 
<a href=ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/net-research/>nv</a>
and the INRIA Video-conferencing System,
<a href=http://www.inria.fr/rodeo/ivs.html>ivs</a>.

<h3><a name=installation>Installation</a></h3>
The easiest way to install vat is to grab the binary distribution
for your architecture (see the list below), unpack it, and
install the executable and manual entry.  You can also get
the source distribution and
<a href=#srcbuild>build vat from source.</a>

<dl>
<dt><a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/pub/conferencing/vat/sparc-sunos4.tar.gz>
Sparcs running SunOS</a><dd>
	Vat should run on any version of sparcstation (1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20,
	SLC, ELC, IPC, IPX) running SunOS 4.1.x.

	<p>Note that the
	audio buffer size used by the stock SunOS 4.1.x kernel
	is too large for good interactive response.  This can
	be fixed with a kernel patch -- instructions are in
	the <a href=ftp://ftp.isi.edu/mbone/faq.txt>MBone FAQ</a>.<p>
	
<dt><a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/pub/conferencing/vat/sparc-solaris.tar.gz>
Sparcs running Solaris</a><dd>
	Vat should run on any version of sparcstation (1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20,
	SLC, ELC, IPC, IPX) running Solaris 2.x for x>1.

	<p> Vat does not work in unicast mode under Solaris 2.3 due to
	a kernel bug.  Sun has provided a 
<a href=ftp://playground.sun.com/pub/solaris2/unicast-vat-workaround.tar>
	workaround</a>.<p>

<dt>
<a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/pub/conferencing/vat/decalpha-osf3.2.tar.gz>
DEC OSF-3.x</a>
and 
<a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/pub/conferencing/vat/decmips-ultrix.tar.gz>
DEC Ultrix</a><dd>
	Vat should run on any DEC Alpha running OSF/1 v3.x using
	either the build-in audio or the audio on a J300 board.
	Vat should run on any DEC 3max (5000 series) with a LoFi
	audio board and running Ultrix 4.2 or above.
	On these architectures, vat requires release 3 of the DEC CRL
	<a href=ftp://crl.dec.com/pub/dec/AF/AF3R1.tar.Z>AudioFile</a>
	audio server.<p>

<dt>
<a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/pub/conferencing/vat/hp700-hpux.tar.gz>
HP HPUX-9</a><dd>
	Vat may run on versions of HP Snake (700 or 7000 series)
	that have built-in audio hardware.  We have tested it on
	710s, 715s & 735s.

	<p>Note that the HPUX Audio server (AServer) was <em>not</em>
	designed with interactive audio in mind -- in our attempts
	to use it, we typically saw delays of several seconds between the
	audio hardware and the net.  To work around problems with
	AServer, vat uses the kernel /dev/audio device directly.
	Unfortunately, this interface <!-- although the only useful
	access to the audio hardware, --> is not documented and HP
	has changed it several times.
	Our only HP is an ancient 735 running HPUX-9.0 so we rely on others
	in the user community to send us the patches or information
	needed to keep vat running on HP hardware.<p>

<dt>
<a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/pub/conferencing/vat/sgi-irix5.tar.gz>
SGI Irix-5</a><dd>
	Should run on any SGI Indy, Indigo or Indigo2 running IRIX 5.x.
	We have tested it on an Indigo and an Indy.<p>

<dt>
<a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/pub/conferencing/vat/i486-bsdos.tar.gz>
x86 BSD/OS 2</a><dd>
	Vat should run on i386/486/586 PCs with soundblaster-compatible
	sound cards running BSD/386 2.0 or later.
<p>
	The i386 binary also has been reported to run under NetBSD
	(using a modified version of the LBL sound driver) and
	FreeBSD (using the Linux sound driver with additional
	support for /dev/audio).  Amancio Hasty (hasty@netcom.com)
	reports that under FreeBSD vat can operate in full-duplex
	mode with the Gravis Ultrasound (and that the quality is
	very satisfactory).<p>

<dt>
<a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/pub/conferencing/vat/i486-linux.tar.gz>
x86 Linux</a><dd>
	Vat should run on i386/486/586 PCs with equiped with sound cards
	supported by <a href=http://personal.eunet.fi/pp/voxware/>VoxWare</a>
	(the standard Linux sound driver) and running Linux 1.2.8 or later.
<p>
	The current vat linux audio driver is quite primitive.  It
	treats the sound card as half-duplex (e.g., a soundblaster)
	even if it is capable of full-duplex operation (e.g., a GUS).
	It also does not use the `mixer' controls that set the record
	and play volume and/or select input and output ports.  We hope
	someone in the community will add the missing pieces to
	vat's linux-audio.cc.
<p>
	Under linux 1.2.x, multicast through the loopback interface
	does not work.	This is a serious deficiency since local
	(loopback) multicast sockets are used to implement
	"conference busses" that vat/vic/etc. use to do things
	like pass the audio hardware between different vats,
	automatically switch video windows on audio activity, etc.
	We understand that this problem has been fixed in more
	recent versions of linux (1.3.?).  If your kernel doesn't
	have the fix, the first symptom is that it will be very
	difficult to switch the audio between multiple instances
	of vat. (Normally you just click the right mouse button it
	the vat window you want active and the audio will be assigned
	to that window.  This won't work at all if the linux loopback
	multicast is broken.)  If your kernel has the bug, it will
	be difficult to handle multiple vats and you will probably want
	to run just one at a time.

<h3><a name=srcbuild>Building Vat from Source</a></h3>

To build vat from source, start by getting and unpacking the
<!--<a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/conferencing/vat/vatsrc.tar.gz>-->
<a href=alpha-test.html>
source tar</a>.  E.g., after ftping the tar, run
<ul>
<li> <tt>gzip -d -c vatsrc-tar.gz | tar xfv -</tt>
</ul>

(<a href=ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gzip-1.2.4.tar>gzip</a> is available
from the GNU Project.)
This will place the contents of the source distribution
in <tt>./vat-x.y</tt> where <i>x.y</i> is the current version number.
`cd' into this directory and do the following:
<ul>
<li> Make sure <a href=http://www.sunlabs.com/research/tcl/>
tcl/tk</a> (v7.5/4.1) is installed or built in the directory
above the vat tree.  Vat requires at least v4.1 of tk.

<p>
<li> Make sure the
<a href=http://www.cs.tu-berlin.de/~jutta/toast.html>TU-Berlin</a>
<a href=ftp://ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de/pub/local/kbs/tubmik/gsm/gsm-1.0.7.tar.gz>
GSM distribution</a> is installed in the directory above the vat tree.
Note that both the GSM library & the GSM source are needed.
If the compilation fails because of a missing include for private.h,
it means vat couldn't find the GSM source.
<p>
<li> Make sure that release 3 of the DEC CRL
<a href=ftp://crl.dec.com/pub/dec/AF/AF3R1.tar.Z>AudioFile</a>
audio server is installed in the directory above the vat tree.
If configure can't find AudioFile, it will report <em>
can't find AudioFile - vat AF support won't be compiled.</em>
The only platforms that require AudioFile are DEC Alphas & DEC MIPS
so others can generally ignore this error.
<p>
<li> Run the ./configure script.
You may specify the following arguments to configure:
<center><table border cellspacing=1>
<br>
<tr>
	<td>-x-includes=<i>path</i></td>
	<td>specify a pathname for the X include tree</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>-x-libraries=<i>path</i></td>
	<td>specify a pathname for the X libraries</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>-with-tcl=<i>path</i></td>
	<td>specify a pathname for tcl</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>-with-tk=<i>path</i></td>
	<td>specify a pathname for tk</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>-with-gsm=<i>path</i></td>
	<td>specify a pathname for GSM</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>-with-af=<i>path</i></td>
	<td>specify a pathname for AudioFile</td>
</tr>
</table></center>
<br>
If you run into problems with configure, you should edit <i>configure.in</i>
instead of <i>configure</i> and use
<a href=ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/>GNU autoconf</a>
to generate a new configure from configure.in.  If you need to make
such changes, please send them to us so future versions of vat
will configure out of the box.

<li> Run make.
<li> If make completes successfully, run `make install' as root
to install the binary and man page.
</ul>
If you are attempting to get vat running on a platform that isn't
listed above, things will probably be more difficult.
See the <a href=porting-vat.html>porting notes</a> for help.

<p>
If you do a port to a new system or hardware and would like
to feed your changes back into the distribution, we would be
delighted to have them.  If you have a vat binary you would like added
the the distribution, or if you would like us to add a link to
this page, please let us know.

<h3><a name=notes>Notes</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>	Based on the principle of least surprise, we've made vat-4
	upwards compatible with vat-3.  I.e., it is a drop-in replacement
	for vat-3 and by default will come up speaking the old vat protocol.
	However, vat-4 accepts a <b>-r</b> flag or
	<b>Vat.sessionType: rtp</b> Xresource to support
	sessions using the RTP protocol.  RTP is far superior to
	the original vat protocol and we hope it will soon become
	the default but in the interim we have to figure out the
	right sequence of tool deployment and sd/sdr changes to
	coordinate an orderly transition between the two protocols.
<p>
	We encourage experimenters to use RTP mode whenever possible.
<p>
<li>	The <em>Missing Packets</em> statistic in vat-3 and earlier
	was always unreliable because the original vat protocol didn't
	include the sequence number necessary to compute it.  When
	running vat-4 in backward compatability mode, <em>Missing Packets</em>
	will always be reported as 0.  It, and all the other statistics,
	are correct and accurate if running in RTP mode.

</ul>
