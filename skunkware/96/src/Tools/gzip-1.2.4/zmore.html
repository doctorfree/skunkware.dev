<STRONG>NAME</STRONG>
  zmore - file perusal filter for crt viewing of compressed
  text

<STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>
  <STRONG>zmore</STRONG> [ name ...  ]

<STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
  <EM>Zmore</EM> is a filter which allows examination of compressed or
  plain text files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy
  terminal.  <EM>zmore</EM> works on files compressed with <EM>compress</EM>,
  <EM>pack</EM> or <EM>gzip</EM>, and also on uncompressed files.  If a file
  does not exist, <EM>zmore</EM> looks for a file of the same name with
  the addition of a .gz, .z or .Z suffix.

  <EM>Zmore</EM> normally pauses after each screenful, printing --
  More-- at the bottom of the screen.  If the user then types
  a carriage return, one more line is displayed.  If the user
  hits a space, another screenful is displayed.  Other
  possibilities are enumerated later.

  <EM>Zmore</EM> looks in the file /<EM>etc</EM>/<EM>termcap</EM> to determine terminal
  characteristics, and to determine the default window size.
  On a terminal capable of displaying 24 lines, the default
  window size is 22 lines.  To use a pager other than the
  default <EM>more</EM>, set environment variable PAGER to the name of
  the desired program, such as <EM>less</EM>.

  Other sequences which may be typed when <EM>zmore</EM> pauses, and
  their effects, are as follows (<STRONG>i</STRONG> is an optional integer
  argument, defaulting to 1) :

  <STRONG>i</STRONG>&lt;space&gt;
	   display <STRONG>i</STRONG> more lines, (or another screenful if no
	   argument is given)

  ^D   display 11 more lines (a ``scroll'').  If <STRONG>i</STRONG> is given,
	   then the scroll size is set to <STRONG>i</STRONG>.

  d    same as ^D (control-D)

  <STRONG>i</STRONG>z   same as typing a space except that <STRONG>i</STRONG>, if present,
	   becomes the new window size.  Note that the window size
	   reverts back to the default at the end of the current
	   file.

  <STRONG>i</STRONG>s   skip <STRONG>i</STRONG> lines and print a screenful of lines

  <STRONG>i</STRONG>f   skip <STRONG>i</STRONG> screenfuls and print a screenful of lines

  q or Q
	   quit reading the current file; go on to the next (if
	   any)

  e or q
	   When the prompt --More--(Next file: <EM>file)</EM> is printed,
	   this command causes zmore to exit.

  s    When the prompt --More--(Next file: <EM>file)</EM> is printed,
	   this command causes zmore to skip the next file and
	   continue.

  =    Display the current line number.

  <STRONG>i</STRONG>/expr
	   search for the <STRONG>i</STRONG>-th occurrence of the regular
	   expression <EM>expr</EM>.  If the pattern is not found, <EM>zmore</EM>
	   goes on to the next file (if any).  Otherwise, a
	   screenful is displayed, starting two lines before the
	   place where the expression was found.  The user's erase
	   and kill characters may be used to edit the regular
	   expression.  Erasing back past the first column cancels
	   the search command.

  <STRONG>i</STRONG>n   search for the <STRONG>i</STRONG>-th occurrence of the last regular
	   expression entered.

  !command
	   invoke a shell with <EM>command</EM>. The character `!' in
	   "command" are replaced with the previous shell command.
	   The sequence "\!" is replaced by "!".

  :q or :Q
	   quit reading the current file; go on to the next (if
	   any) (same as q or Q).

  .    (dot) repeat the previous command.

  The commands take effect immediately, i.e., it is not
  necessary to type a carriage return.  Up to the time when
  the command character itself is given, the user may hit the
  line kill character to cancel the numerical argument being
  formed.  In addition, the user may hit the erase character
  to redisplay the --More-- message.

  At any time when output is being sent to the terminal, the
  user can hit the quit key (normally control-\).  <EM>Zmore</EM> will
  stop sending output, and will display the usual --More--
  prompt.  The user may then enter one of the above commands
  in the normal manner.  Unfortunately, some output is lost
  when this is done, due to the fact that any characters
  waiting in the terminal's output queue are flushed when the
  quit signal occurs.

  The terminal is set to <EM>noecho</EM> mode by this program so that
  the output can be continuous.  What you type will thus not
  show on your terminal, except for the / and !  commands.

  If the standard output is not a teletype, then <EM>zmore</EM> acts
  just like <EM>zcat</EM>, except that a header is printed before each
  file.
