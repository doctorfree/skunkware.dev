Usage: ird [-h] [-c<lh>] [-m<chars>] [-s<speed>] [<tty>]
ird reads its input for data sent by an infrared remote control receiver
and displays it using characters to show whether carrier was received for
each bit time.  Each bit of each input byte is translated into one of two
characters.  0 and 1 bits are taken to be non-carrier and periods
respectively.  The low bit is expected to contain the first bit time of
signal and the high bit the last bit time.
If no tty name is given, the standard input is read.
Input need not be a real tty (so that log files can be read).
The program may be halted by keyboard interrupt.
Options:
-h: Print this help.
-c<lh>: set the characters used to represent a absence and presence of
    carrier, e.g.: '-c01'.  If a 0 bit represents the presence of carrier,
    give the character for presence first.  The default is '-c_~'.
-p: Print the period of each cycle (the period from the onset of each
    non-carrier period to the onset of the next non-carrier period).  The
    unit is one serial bit time.
-d: Print the duration of each carrier and non-carrier period, in
    the same units.
-r: Output the raw data.
-t<0-period,1-period>: Translate data into 0s and 1s.  Cycles with periods
    of 0-period and 1-period are translated into 0s and 1s respectively.
    The allowable jitter can be set with -j.  Values outside of these
    ranges are printed as <period>.  Example: -t 23,46
-j<jitter>: Set the allowable jitter.  The default is 1.
-m<chars>: To reduce overhead, batches of <chars> chars are processed.
    <chars> must be between 1 and 255.  The default is 255.
-s<speed>: Set the tty speed to <speed> Baud.  <speed> must be a valid
    tty rate.  The default is 38400.
