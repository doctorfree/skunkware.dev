Usage:
stat [-adhlnor] [-[mM]<mask>] [-T<type>] [-s<char>] [-c<char>] [-t<fmt>]
     [-[fL][nLpidlobuUgGsSNJamcAMCOBt]] [file ...]
No field name or value is printed for fields that have no meaning for the
file being described (for example, link contents for a file that is not a
symbolic link).
Options:
n: Don't print stat field names.
h: Print this help.
r: stat filenames read from stdin, one per line, after any on command line.
   Empty lines are ignored.
s: Like -r, except that an additional 'tag' string may be given after the
   filename.  The tag is separated from the filename to be stat'ed by the
   last instance of <char> that occurs on the input line.  Give a separate
   null argument (i.e. -s "") to set <char> to be a null character (this
   is useful because a null cannot appear in a path).  The tag may be
   printed with the 't' field specifier.  The tag should be no more than
   1024 characters.
D: For any files that are directories, report on all of the files in the
   directory except '.' and '..' rather than on the directory itself.
   This works with filenames only, not file descriptors.  Give -l if
   directories pointed to by symbolic links should be processed.
l: Dereference symbolic links.  Normally, symbolic links are printed as
   such.  If -l is given, information about the file the symbolic link
   points to is printed.
m: Logically AND file mode with <mask> before printing it.
   <mask> consists of symbolic mode characters and/or an octal number.
   If both are given, the symbolic characters must come first.
   The symbolic characters and the mode bits they stand for are:
   u: setuid.  g: setgid.  t: sticky.  T: all of the file type bits.
   R, W, X: all of the readability, writability, and executability bits.
   U, G, O: all of the user-, group-, and other-accessibility bits.
   b, c, d, n, p, r: set the file type bits for block, character,
   directory, any name type, pipe, and regular files.
M: Print file information only if <mask> (specified as for -m) exactly
   matches the file mode.  If <mask> is prefixed with a '+' or '-', file
   information is printed if any or all of the bits specified by <mask>
   are set respectively.
T: Print file information only if the file type is <type>.  Possible file
   file types are r (regular), d (directory), c (character), b (block),
   p (pipe), s (semaphore), and m (memory).
   they do for the 'b' field speficiation.  ? refers to any type that is
   not one of the others.
c: Use <char> instead of newline to separate each field from the next.  If
   <char> is more than one character long, it is interpreted as an integer
   representation of the character, decimal by default.  Octal and hex
   values can be given by preceding the value with 0 or 0x respectively.
   To separate the fields with null chars, use  -c ''  or  -c 00
d: All filenames that consist of digits are taken to be file descriptors
   to be fstat()ed.  The file handle is printed instead of the link name.
o: fstat() all open file descriptors after other filenames are processed.
t: Use <format> as an strftime(S) format string to print file times for
   A, M, and C field specifications.  The default is "%y/%m/%d %T".
a: Print all fields in all formats.  Equivalent to -fnLpidlobuUgGsSNJamcAMCOBt.
   The OB fields are printed only if -m is given, and the t field is
   printed only if -s is given.
f: Select fields to print.  The default is nMidlugsJNamc.
   Fields are printed in the order given.  The fields are:
   n: name of the link used to access the file (not part of stat struct).
   o: file mode, in octal.  If a mask is given, at least as many
      characters as are given in the mask will be printed, with leading
      zeros if neccessary.
   O: like 'o', except that if a mask is given, any bit excluded is not
      printed (the masked-in bits are concatenated together before
      conversion to octal).
   p: file permissions, in octal (equivalent to -fo -m7777).
   b: file mode, symbolically.  The first character indicates the type of
      the file (Regular, Directory, Character, Block, Pipe, Semaphore,
      shared Memory, other Name file, or ?unknown); the next three tell
      whether the setUid, setGid, and sTicky bits are set; and the last
      nine tell whether Read, Write, & eXecute are set for user, group,
      and other.  If a mask is given and some of the file type bits are
      excluded, a bogus type may be printed.
   B: like 'b', except that if a mask is given, the character for any bit
      excluded is not printed.  If any of the file type bits is excluded,
      the file type is not printed.
   i: inode number.
   d: ID of device containing directory entry.
   l: number of links to file.
   L: symbolic link contents (file name that symlink points to).
   u, g: file's user and group ownership, as integers.
   U, G: file's user and group as names if they have entries in /etc/passwd
      and /etc/group respectively; else as integers.
   s: file size, in bytes (not printed for block, char, or name files).
   J, N: Major & minor number (printed only for block, char & name files).
   S: file size, in blocks of size used by the filesystem the file resides on.
   a, m, c: time of last access, modification, and creation, in seconds
      since 00:00:00 GMT 1 Jan 1970.
   A, M, C: time of last access, modification, and creation, in local time.
L: Like -f, but also sets other modes commonly used for printing status of
   files one per line.  Sets -n (stat field names not printed) and -c' '
   (use space to separate fields).  The automatic -c option can be
   overridden by giving an explicit one later on the command line.
