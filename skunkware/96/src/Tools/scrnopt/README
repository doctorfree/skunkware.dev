screenopt: optimize screen updates.
screenopt optimizes screen updates in applications where a large amount of
similar data is repeatedly displayed.  Lines written to screenopt are
saved in a buffer.  When a newscreen character is received, the buffer is
displayed on the terminal and then saved for comparison to the next screen.
When the buffer is displayed, it is compared to the previous buffer
and only those portions of the screen that have changed are updated.
If the first character after the newscreen character is a newline,
it is discarded.  Only as many lines as the terminal can display are
saved in the buffer.
Options:
The environment variable TERM, used to determine how to do the optimized
screen updates, can be overridden with the option -t termtype
The newscreen character can be set with -n c
It is ^L (formfeed, control-L) by default.
-h gives this help screen.
