segfont: Write strings as 25-segment chars using character graphics.
Usage:  segfont [-hkpdb] [-c<char>] [-f<file>] [-g<gap>]
        [-r<rotates>] [-s<size>] [-w<width>] [string ...]
   If no strings are given on command line, standard input is read.
   -b (backwards): Reverse input strings before printing.
   -c : Replace the default segment chars with <char>.  If <char> is 
not given, output chars will be built from the char they are representing.
   -d : Print strings down (vertically) in adjacent columns.  If -b is also
given, output will be bottom-adjusted (strings will start at the bottom).
   -e : Do not use tabs in output.
   -f : Use 25-segment font given in <file> instead of internal font.
See the file "segfont.def" for an example.
   -g : Set gap (number of spaces between characters) to <gap>.
The default is to set the gap to the character size.
   -h : Print this help screen.
   -k : Kill proportional spacing; use fixed spacing instead.
   -p : Issue a page eject (formfeed, ^L) after each set of columns when
printing down.  It has no effect if -d is not also given.
   -r : Rotate output chars clockwise 90*<rotates> degrees.  
<rotates> should be between one and three.
   -s : Set char size (the number of segment chars that each variable-size
segment is constructed from).  It must be at least 1.  The default is 3.
   -w : Set page width to <width> chars.  The default is 80.
