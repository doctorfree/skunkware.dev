slow: Write data slowly.
     At regular intervals, slow reads a given number of characters from
its input (files or its standard input) and writes them to its standard
output.  The number of characters read and written is referred to as a
block, and by default is one character.  The interval is the reciprocal of
the blocks-per-second argument that is slow's one required argument.
     If slow determines that more than one interval has passed without
characters being written, it will process more than one block to catch up.
This will occur under various circumstances.  If the interval is less than
the shortest amount of time that a process can sleep, slow will
occasionally, or always, have to process more than one block.  slow may
also oversleep due to CPU load or being suspended, or due to being blocked
on input or output as a result of IO throttling, data available at an
insufficient rate, flow control, etc. See the -l argument to control this
behaviour.
     The largest amount of data that slow will write is one buffer's
worth.  If more data is to be written in an operation, either because the
blocksize is larger than the buffer size or because enough blocks are
being written that the buffer size is exceeded, data is output in
consecutive buffer-size writes until the required amount has been written.
The last write may be less than a buffer's worth.  If it is important that
each write have a specific size, set both the buffer size and block size
to that value.
Usage: slow [-h] [-r<repeat>] [-b<blocksize>] [-l<lagtime>]
            [-s<buffer size>] <bps> [file ...]
where <bps> is the number of blocks per second to print.
If no filenames are given, the standard input is read.
Options:
-h: Print this help.
The values given with any of the following options can include a k or m
suffix to cause the value to be multiplied by 1K (1024) or 1M (1048576).
-b<blocksize>: Set the block size to <blocksize> characters.
    If 0 is given, the block size become the size of the entire file.
-s<buffer size>: Set the buffer size.  The default is 16384 bytes.
-l<lagtime>: The maximum amount of time that slow will try to catch up on,
    in milliseconds.  If slow oversleeps more than <lagtime>, only
    <lagtime>'s worth of blocks is output.  The default is 100 mS.  Use 0
    to eliminate the cap.  Data is never discarded, only written later.
-r<repeat>: Output each file <repeat> times.  If <repeat> is 0, the first
    file named is repeated indefinitely.  The program may be halted by
    keyboard interrupt.
