<h1>10. SESSIONS, INITIALIZATION, AND RECOVERY</h1>

This section of the manual describes the life-cycle of an edit session.
We begin with the definition of an <a href="#SESSION">edit session</a>
and what that means to elvis.
This is followed by sections discussing <a href="#INIT">initialization</a>
and <a href="#RECOVER">recovery after a crash.</a>

<h2>10.1 Sessions</h2><a name="SESSION"></a>

Elvis is eventually expected to meet the COSE standards,
which require (among other things) that programs be able to save their
state so that they can be restarted later.
It isn't required to restart in <em>exactly</em> the same state,
but it should come as close as possible.

<p>For elvis, this means that edit sessions should be restartable.
It is possible to begin an edit session with one elvis process,
exit that process, and then later start a new elvis process which
resumes the previous edit session.

<p>To accomplish this, elvis stores its state in a file, called the session
file.
For all practical purposes, the session file <strong>is</strong> the session.

<p>The name of the session file is stored in the <a href="elvisopt.html#session">session</a> option.
By default, this will be a file in your home directory, named "elvis*.ses",
where "*" represents a number chosen at run-time to make the file name unique.
You can specify some other name for the session file via the
<strong>-s</strong><var>session</var> command-line flag.

<p>If the session file doesn't already exist when elvis starts running,
then elvis will create it.

<p>When elvis exits, it will normally delete the session file if this
is the elvis process that created it.
If the session file was left over from some other elvis process, then
elvis will not delete it upon exiting.
This is controlled by the <a href="elvisopt.html#tempsession">tempsession</a>
option; if you don't like elvis' default behavior then you can change it.

<h2>10.2 Initialization</h2><a name="INIT"></a>

Elvis begins by initializing some options to hardcoded values.

<p>Elvis then chooses which user interface it should use.
Elvis does this by scanning the command line arguments for a
<strong>-g</strong><var>gui</var> flag; if there is no such flag,
then elvis tests each user interface and uses the best one that
is expected to work.
(For example, the "x11" interface is expected to work if there is a DISPLAY
environment variable and the X server is accessible.
If not, then the "x11" interface is rejected and some other interface
is used.)

<p>The session file is then opened or created.
For preexisting session files, elvis scans the session file for any buffers
in it, and adds them to its internal list.
Elvis can even reload the "undo" versions of some buffers.

<p>Elvis searches through the directories named in the
<a href="elvisopt.html#elvispath">elvispath</a> option for a file named
"elvis.ini".
If it finds that file, then it loads it into a buffer named "Elvis&nbsp;initialization" and executes its contents as a series of ex commands.
See <a href="#elvis.ini">section 10.2.1</a> for description of the default
contents of this file.

<p>After that, it attempts to similarly load some other files, but they
aren't executed.
Some of them will be executed later.
These files are:

<pre graphic>.-----------.----------------------.------------------------------.
| FILE NAME | BUFFER NAME          | PURPOSE                      |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| <a href="elvismsg.html">elvis.msg</a> | Elvis messages       | used to translate messages   |
| <a href="#elvis.brf">elvis.brf</a> | Elvis before reading | executed before loading file |
| <a href="#elvis.arf">elvis.arf</a> | Elvis after reading  | executed after loading file  |
| <a href="#elvis.bwf">elvis.bwf</a> | Elvis before writing | executed before saving file  |
| <a href="#elvis.awf">elvis.awf</a> | Elvis after writing  | executed after saving file   |
^-----------^----------------------^------------------------------^
</pre>
The "elvis.msg" file is described in section
<a href="elvismsg.html">11: Messages.</a>
The other files are described later in this section.

<p>The next step in initialization is to load the first file and display
it in a window.
To do this, it first creates an empty buffer with the same name as the file.
It then executes the "Elvis before reading" buffer (if it exists) on the
empty buffer.
The file's contents are then read into the buffer.
Then the "Elvis after reading" buffer (if it exists) is executed on
the new buffer.
Finally, elvis creates a new window that shows the new buffer.

<p>If the <strong>-a</strong> flag was given on the command line, then
elvis will repeat the above steps for each file named on the command line.
On the other hand, if no filenames were given on the command line then
elvis will simply create a single untitled buffer and a window that shows it.


<h3>10.2.1 The "elvis.ini" file</h3><a name="elvis.ini"></a>

The "elvis.ini" file is loaded into a buffer named "Elvis&nbsp;initialization".
That buffer is then executed before any other initialization files are loaded.
If the session file is later restarted, this script will be executed again
at that time.
Here's a line-by-line analysis of the default "elvis.ini" file...

<pre>
	" SET SOME LOCAL DEFAULTS
	set lptype=ps2 lplines=60 lpcolumns=80 lpwrap
</pre>
This line initializes the <a href="elvisopt.html#LPR">printer options</a>
to values that are appropriate for my system.
You'll probably need to change them for your system.

<pre>
	" DEFINE SOME LATIN-1 DIGRAPHS
	source! (elvispath("elvis.lat"))
</pre>
This attempts to locate the "elvis.lat" file and execute it.
The "elvis.lat" file is an ex script which contains a bunch of
<a href="elvisex.html#digraph">:digraph</a> commands that set up the
digraph table appropriately for the Latin-1 symbol set.
The "!" at the end of the <a href="elvisex.html#source">:source</a>
command name causes <tt>:source</tt> to silently ignore errors.

<pre>
	let p=tolower(basename(program))
	if p == "ex" || p == "edit"
	then set initialstate=ex
	if p == "view"
	then set defaultreadonly
	if p == "edit" || p == "vedit"
	then set novice
	if home == ""
	then let home=dirdir(program)
</pre>
These lines initialize certain options according to the name by which
elvis was invoked.
Traditionally, invoking vi by the name "ex" causes it to start up in
ex mode instead of vi mode, and "view" causes the files to be treated
as readonly.

<pre>
	" X11 INTERFACE DEFAULTS GO HERE
	if gui == "x11"
	then color i saddlebrown|color u navyblue
	then if normalfont == ""
	then set normalfont="*-courier-medium-r-*-18-*" 
	then set boldfont="*-courier-bold-r-*-18-*" 
	then set italicfont="*-courier-medium-o-*-18-*" 
</pre>
These lines set the defaults for the "x11" user interface.
You should set the defaults here, and <em>not</em> in an app-defaults file.
If you aren't using the "x11" user interface, then these lines have no effect.

<pre>
	" EXECUTE THE STANDARD CUSTOMIZATION SCRIPTS
	let f=(os=="unix" ? ".exrc" : "elvis.rc")
	if $EXINIT
	then eval $EXINIT
	else source! ~$1(f)
	if exrc
	then safer! (f)
</pre>
These lines set the <a href="elvisopt.html#f">f</a> option to either ".exrc"
or "elvis.rc", whichever is appropriate for your operating system.
They then check whether an environment variable named "EXINIT" is set
to a non-empty value.
If so, then the value of EXINIT is executed as an ex command line;
otherwise the ".exrc" or "elvis.rc" file in your home directory is
executed, if it exists.
(The $1 is replaced by a forward or backward slash, depending on your
operating system.)
If EXINIT or .exrc/elvis.rc (whichever was executed) has set the
<a href="elvisopt.html#exrc">exrc</a> option then elvis will
execute ".exrc" or "elvis.rc" in the current directory, if it exists.
Elvis uses <a href="elvisex.html#safer">:safer</a> instead of
<a href="elvisex.html#source">:source</a> to execute the file
for security reasons.

<h3>10.2.2 The "elvis.brf" file</h3><a name="elvis.brf"></a>

The "elvis.brf" file is loaded into a buffer named
"Elvis before reading".
That buffer is executed immediately before loading any
user file into a user buffer.

<pre>
	" TAKE A GUESS AT THE BUFFER'S TYPE
	let e=tolower(dirext(filename))
	if e==".bin" || e==".dat" || (os=="msdos" || os=="win32")
						&& (e=".exe" || e=".com")
	then set binary
</pre>
These lines try to guess whether the file is binary or not.
This must be done before the file is loaded because for non-binary
files elvis converts newlines to linefeeds as it reads the file.

<p>Note: The "if" line is split above merely as a typographical convenience.
In the real "elvis.brf" file, the "if" line and "&&" line are actually a
single line.

<h3>10.2.3 The "elvis.arf" file</h3><a name="elvis.arf"></a>

The "elvis.arf" file is loaded into a buffer named "Elvis after reading).
That buffer is automatically executed immediately after a user file has been
loaded into a user buffer.

<pre>
	" TAKE A GUESS AT THE BUFFER'S PREFERRED DISPLAY MODE
	let e=tolower(dirext(filename))
	if e==".c" || e==".h" || e==".cpp"
	then set bufdisplay=c
	if e&lt;&lt;4==".htm"
	then set bufdisplay=html
	if e==".man" || e==".1"
	then set bufdisplay=man
	if binary
	then set bufdisplay=hex
</pre>
These lines try to guess the preferred display mode for the file,
mostly by examining the filename's extension.

<pre>
	" EXECUTE MODELINES, IF "modelines" OPTION IS SET
	if modelines && buflines &gt;= 1 && buflines &lt;= 10
	then %s/ex:\(.*\):/\1/x
	if modelines && buflines &gt; 10
	then 1,5s/ex:\(.*\):/\1/x
	then $-4,$s/ex:\(.*\):/\1/x
</pre>
These commands search for modelines in the newly loaded file,
if the <a href="elvisopt.html#modelines">modelines</a> option is set.
The modelines are executed via the new "x" option to the
<a href="elvisex.html#substitute">:s</a> command.

<h3>10.2.4 The "elvis.bwf" file</h3><a name="elvis.bwf"></a>

The "elvis.bwf" file is loaded into a buffer named "Elvis before writing".
That buffer is executed as a series of ex commands immediately before
writing the entire contents of a buffer out over its original file.

<pre>
	if backup && !newfile && os=="unix"
	then eval ! cp -f (filename) (basename(filename)).bak
	if backup && !newfile && os!="unix"
	then eval ! copy (filename) (basename(filename)).bak
</pre>
These lines copy the original version of the file to a "*.bak" file.
Note that we implement separate Unix and non-Unix versions of the
copy command here.

<h3>10.2.5 The "elvis.awf" file</h3><a name="elvis.awf"></a>

The "elvis.awf" file is loaded into a buffer named "Elvis after writing".
That buffer is executed as a series of ex command immediately after
writing the entire contents of a buffer out over its original file.

<p>There is no default "elvis.awf" file,
because I haven't found any need for one yet.

<h2>10.3 Recovery</h2><a name="RECOVER"></a>

If elvis ever dies an unnatural death, the session file will be left behind.
This session file contains all of the changes you've made during your edit
session, so you should be able to start a new elvis process on the
old session file and recover all of your changes.

<p>Only one elvis process at a time is allowed to use a given session file.
To enforce this, when elvis starts up it sets an "in use" flag in the
session file's header.
Any later elvis process will test that flag, and refuse to use a session
file which is already in use.

<p>When elvis crashes, it leaves the "in use" flag set, even though the
process that was using it has died.
You must restart your edit session via "<tt>elvis -r</tt>".
The <strong>-r</strong> flag tells elvis to ignore the "in use" flag.

<p>When this new elvis process starts up, it will be displaying a new,
empty buffer.
<strong>Don't panic!</strong>
Your edit buffers are still intact; they just don't happen to be displayed
in the initial window.

<p>After a crash, the session file might not be entirely self-consistent.
Because of this, it is dangerous to edit the file using this session file.
<strong>You should save your old buffer to a file immediately,
and then exit elvis.</strong>
To save your old buffer give elvis the command
"<tt>:(</tt><var>buffer</var><tt>)w </tt><var>filename</var>"
where <var>buffer</var> is the name of your buffer
(usually the same as the original file name) and
<var>filename</var> is the name of a new file where you wish to store the text.
For safety's sake, you should not write the salvaged buffer out over the top
of the original text file.

<p>After exiting, you should give the shell command "<tt>rm&nbsp;core&nbsp;~/elvis*.ses</tt>"
to delete the core file and the damaged session file.
(For DOS/Windows users, the command is "<tt>DEL ELVIS*.SES</tt>".)

<p>If you can figure out how to reproduce the problem, please let me know!

<h2>10.4 Other files</h2>
The following configuration files aren't really related to initialization
or sessions, but since we've discussed so many configuration files in this
chapter already, we might as well finish it off.

<dl>

<dt>*.man
<dd>These files are Unix-style "man pages" describing each of the programs.
You can view them with elvis' "man" display mode, or you can print them
via "troff -man ...".

<dt>elvis*.html
<dd>These files store the on-line interactive manual for elvis.
When you use the <a href="elvisex.html#help">:help</a> command, elvis
locates the necessary file and loads it.
These files are written in HTML so you can also view/print them using
a Web browser such as Netscape.

<dt><a name="elvis.lat"></a>elvis.lat
<dd>This file contains a bunch of <a href="elvisex.html#digraph">:digraph</a>
commands for setting up the digraph table for the Latin-1 symbol set.
The default <a href="#elvis.ini">elvis.ini</a> file interprets this file's
contents automatically.

<dt><a name="elvis.msg"></a>elvis.msg
<dd>This file stores a translation table, which allows you to customize
elvis' messages.
This file is described in the <a href="elvismsg.html#elvis.msg">Messages</a>
chapter.

<dt><a name="elvistrs.msg"></a>elvistrs.msg
<dd>This contains a rough list of nearly all of elvis' terse messages.
You can use this as a resource when constructing an
<a href="elvismsg.html#elvis.msg">elvis.msg</a> file.

<dt><a name="elvis.ps"></a>elvis.ps
<dd>The PostScript printer drivers (<a href="elvisopt.html#lptype">lptype</a>=ps
or ps2) include this file's contents in the printer output.
This file should contain PostScript code which defines the symbols
<tt>ElvisN, ElvisB,</tt> and <tt>ElvisI</tt> as 12-point monospaced fonts
to be used for normal text, bold text, and italic text, respectively.
It also defines <tt>ElvisPage, ElvisLeftPage,</tt> and <tt>ElvisRightPage</tt>
procedures for setting the size and position of a page's text on the paper.
If this file doesn't exist or is unreadable, elvis will use the following
definitions:
<pre>
/ElvisN /Courier findfont 12 scalefont def
/ElvisB /Courier-Bold findfont 12 scalefont def
/ElvisI /Courier-Oblique findfont 12 scalefont def
/ElvisPage { 12 36 translate } def
/ElvisLeftPage { 12 750 translate -90 rotate 0.58 0.75 scale } def
/ElvisRightPage { newpath 12 394 moveto 576 0 rlineto stroke
                 12 366 translate -90 rotate 0.58 0.75 scale } def
</pre>

<a href="elvisdm.html#syntax">syntax display mode.</a>
For a full description of this file, see the
<a href="elvisdm.html#elvis.syn">Language Specification</a> section in the
<a href="elvisdm.html">Display Modes</a> chapter.

<dt><a name="elvis.xbm"></a>elvis.xbm
<dd>This stores a two-color Elvis icon, in the X-Windows XBM format.

<dt><a name="elvis.xpm"></a>elvis.xpm
<dd>This stores a four-color Elvis icon, in the X-Windows XPM format.

<dt><a name="printdoc.bat"></a>printdoc.bat
<dd>This contains a series of program invocations for printing all of the 
elvis documentation in the correct sequence.
