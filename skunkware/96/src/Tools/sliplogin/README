1) If you didn't get the binary, build the sliplogin executable with 'make'.
2) Install it executable by all, owned by root, with the setuid bit set.  The
   permissions should look like this: ---s--x--x.  Only users who exist in the
   hosts.slip file will be able to successfully use sliplogin.  If the
   permissions worry you, make a group for the sliplogin users, and make
   sliplogin only executable by that group.

3) Create a file /etc/hosts.slip, with the following format:

# Login	Netmask		Local IP addr	Remote IP addr	TTYs		Args
slhaban	255.255.255.240	199.164.166.193	199.164.166.194	tty3H,tty1H	+f
slyagi	255.255.255.240	204.75.154.46	204.75.154.45	-		+f
slmoria 255.255.255.240	199.4.218.1     199.4.218.2	tty3H,tty3G

There is one line per system.

The first field is the name that the remote system logs in with.

The second is the netmask.  NOTE, the use of this field is new to this version. 
In previous versions it was unused.  The slattach shipped with SCO UNIX 3.2v5.0
requires a netmask.  On SCO systems, sliplogin will use the __scoinfo() system
call to determine what release of the OS it is running on; if the release is
>= 3.2v5, the netmask will be passed.  However, the field is required to exist
in the hosts.slip file regardless of release.  On a release < 3.2v5, a
placeholder can be put in the file instead of a netmask, since it won't be used
for anything.

The third field is the IP address for the local end of the slip link.

The fourth field is the IP address for the remote end of the slip link.

If a fifth field is given it is a comma-separated list of TTYs the system is
allowed to log in on (by default, the system can log in on any TTY).

If any further fields are given they are arguments to be passed as flags to
slattach.  If the slattach needs to have arguments passed to it but you want no
TTY restriction, make the fifth field '-'.

4) Creat each slip login account, with the login shell being sliplogin.  Or,
   make the login shell be a normal shell, and exec sliplogin from the user's
   .profile.
5) To end a slip session, kill off slattach.  Do NOT hang up without killing
   slattach.  The slip line discipline ignores hangup (loss of carrier), so the
   slip line discipline will remain in effect even if CD goes low.  Any
   ordinary user who dials in will not get a login prompt, and another slip
   user could potentially "steal" the slip connection and any network
   communications in progress.  If an accidental hangup occurs, the slip login
   user should immediately connect again and try to re-establish the slip
   connection (without logging in), or arrange by other means to have slattach
   killed.
