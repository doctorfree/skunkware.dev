ihex2bin: convert Intel-hex format data to a binary file.
Usage: ihex2bin [-dhqsv] [-[cou] output-file] [input-file ...]
-o: Overwrite or create output-file.  Output-file is truncated if it exists.
-u: Update or create output-file.  Output-file is not truncated if it exists;
    further records are written into it, possibly overwriting parts of it.
-c: Check whether output-file exists and create it if it does not.
    If it does, an error message is printed and it is not touched.
-d: Print a dot on stderr for every record written.
-q: Quiet operation: no status messages are printed.
-s: Initial lines that do not begin with ':' are skipped without warning.
-h: Print this help information.
-v: Print a brief description of records as they are written.

If output-file is not given or is given as '-',
output is written to the standard output.
If records do not start at address 0 or contain any non-contiguous records,
output must be a real file, not a pipe or tty (to allow seeking).
If no input-file is given, input is read from the standard input.

bin2ihex: convert binary file to Intel-hex format records.
Usage: bin2ihex [-ehq] [-o outfile] [-g origin] [-b bytes/record] [infile]
-g <origin>: Make addresses specified in output records start at <origin>.
   <origin> may be given in decimal, octal, or hex by using C base syntax.
   The default origin is 0.
-o <outfile>: Write output to <outfile>.
   The default is to write to the standard output.
-b <bytes-per-record>: write <bytes-per-record> bytes (encoded in hex
   format) on each line.  The line length will be <bytes-per-record>*2 + 11
   characters (plus a newline).
   <bytes-per-record> must be between 1 and 255.
-d: Print a dot on stderr for every record processed.
-e: Write extended Intel hex reords.  Addresses may be up to 0xFFFFF.
-q: Quiet operation: no status messages are printed.  If -q is not given,
    the total number of bytes processed is printed to stderr at completion.
-h: Print this help information.

If no input file is given, input is read from the standard input.
