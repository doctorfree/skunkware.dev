     <STRONG>NAME</STRONG>
          ircd - The Internet Relay Chat Program Server

     <STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>
          <STRONG>ircd</STRONG> [-a] [-c] [-i] [-o] [-q] [-t] [-d directory] [-f
               configfile] [-x debuglevel] [-h hostname] [-p portnum]

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          <EM>ircd</EM> is the server (daemon) program for the Internet Relay
          Chat Program.  The <EM>ircd</EM> is a server in that its function is
          to "serve" the client program <EM>irc(1)</EM> with messages and
          commands.  All commands and user messages are passed
          directly to the <EM>ircd</EM> for processing and relaying to other
          ircd sites.  The <EM>irc(1)</EM> program depends upon there being an
          <EM>ircd</EM> server running somewhere (either on your local UNIX
          site or a remote ircd site) so that it will have somewhere
          to connect to and thus allow the user to begin talking to
          other users.

     <STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
          <STRONG>-d</STRONG> <STRONG>directory</STRONG>
               This option tells the server to change to that
               directory and use that as a reference point when
               opening <EM>ircd.conf</EM> and other startup files.

          <STRONG>-o</STRONG>   Starts up a local ircdaemon. Standard input can be used
               to send IRC commands to the daemon. The user logging in
               from standard input will be given operator privileges
               on this local ircd. If ircd is a setuid program, it
               will call setuid(getuid()) before going to local mode.
               This option can be used in inetd.conf to allow users to
               open their own irc clients by simply connecting their
               clients to the correct ports. For example:

          <STRONG>irc</STRONG> <STRONG>stream</STRONG> <STRONG>tcp</STRONG> <STRONG>nowait</STRONG> <STRONG>irc</STRONG> <STRONG>/etc/ircd</STRONG> <STRONG>ircd</STRONG> <STRONG>-f/etc/ircd.conf</STRONG> <STRONG>-o</STRONG>

               allows users connecting to irc port (specified in
               /etc/services) to start up their own ircdaemon. The
               configuration file should be used to check from which
               hosts these connections are allowed from. This option
               also turns on the autodie option -a.

          <STRONG>-a</STRONG>   Instructs the server to automatically die off if it
               loses all it's clients.

          <STRONG>-t</STRONG>   Instructs the server to direct debugging output to
               standard output.

          <STRONG>-x#</STRONG>  Defines the debuglevel for ircd. The higher the
               debuglevel, the more stuff gets directed to debugging
               file (or standard output if -t option was used as
               well).

          <STRONG>-i</STRONG>   The server was started by inetd and it should start
               accepting connections from standard input. The
               following inetd.conf-line could be used to start up
               ircd automatically when needed:

          <STRONG>ircd</STRONG> <STRONG>stream</STRONG> <STRONG>tcp</STRONG> <STRONG>wait</STRONG> <STRONG>irc</STRONG> <STRONG>/etc/ircd</STRONG> <STRONG>ircd</STRONG> <STRONG>-i</STRONG>

               allows inetd to start up ircd on request.

          <STRONG>-f</STRONG> <STRONG>filename</STRONG>
               Specifies the ircd.conf file to be used for this
               ircdaemon. The option is used to override the default
               ircd.conf given at compile time.

          <STRONG>-c</STRONG>   This flag must be given if you are running ircd from
               /<EM>dev</EM>/<EM>console</EM> or any other situation where fd 0 isnt a
               tty and you want the server to fork off and run in the
               background. This needs to be given if you are starting
               <EM>ircd</EM> from an <EM>rc</EM> (such as /<EM>etc</EM>/<EM>rc.local)</EM> file.

          <STRONG>-q</STRONG>   Using the -q option stops the server from doing DNS
               lookups on all the servers in your <EM>ircd.conf</EM> file when
               it boots. This can take a lengthy amount of time if you
               have a large number of servers and they are not all
               close by.

          <STRONG>-h</STRONG> <STRONG>hostname</STRONG>
               Allows the user to manually set the server name at
               startup. The default name is hostname.domainname.  <STRONG>-p</STRONG>
               <STRONG>portname</STRONG> Specifies the port where the daemon should
               start waiting for connections.  This overrides the
               default which is given at compile time.

          If you plan to connect your <EM>ircd</EM> server to an existing Irc-
          Network, you will need to alter your local IRC CONFIGURATION
          FILE (typically named "ircd.conf") so that it will accept
          and make connections to other <EM>ircd</EM> servers.  This file
          contains the hostnames, Network Addresses, and sometimes
          passwords for connections to other ircds around the world.
          Because description of the actual file format of the
          "ircs.conf" file is beyond the scope of this document,
          please refer to the file INSTALL in the IRC source files
          documentation directory.

          BOOTING THE SERVER:  The <EM>ircd</EM> server can be started as part
          of the UNIX boot procedure or just by placing the server
          into Unix Background.  Keep in mind that if it is *not* part
          of your UNIXES Boot-up procedure then you will have to
          manually start the <EM>ircd</EM> server each time your UNIX is
          rebooted.  This means if your UNIX is prone to crashing or
          going for for repairs a lot it would make sense to start the
          <EM>ircd</EM> server as part of your UNIX bootup procedure.  In some
          cases the <EM>irc(1)</EM> will automatically attempt to boot the <EM>ircd</EM>
          server if the user is on the SAME UNIX that the <EM>ircd</EM> is
          supposed to be running on.  If the <EM>irc(1)</EM> cannot connect to
          the <EM>ircd</EM> server it will try to start the server on it's own
          and will then try to reconnect to the newly booted <EM>ircd</EM>
          server.

     <STRONG>EXAMPLE</STRONG>
               tolsun% <STRONG>ircd</STRONG>

          Places <EM>ircd</EM> into UNIX Background and starts up the server
          for use.  Note:  You do not have to add the "&amp;" to this
          command, the program will automatically detach itself from
          tty.
