  (If you're intending to read these straight through for the
  first time, the suggested order will tend to reduce the
  number of forward references.)

  Additional documentation for Perl modules is available in
  the /<EM>usr</EM>/<EM>local</EM>/<EM>man</EM>/ directory.  Some of this is distributed
  standard with Perl, but you'll also find third-party modules
  there.  You should be able to view this with your <EM>man</EM>(1)
  program by including the proper directories in the
  appropriate start-up files.  To find out where these are,
  type:

	  perl -le 'use Config; print "@Config{man1dir,man3dir}"'

  If the directories were /<EM>usr</EM>/<EM>local</EM>/<EM>man</EM>/<EM>man1</EM> and
  /<EM>usr</EM>/<EM>local</EM>/<EM>man</EM>/<EM>man3</EM>, you would only need to add
  /<EM>usr</EM>/<EM>local</EM>/<EM>man</EM> to your MANPATH.  If they are different,
  you'll have to add both stems.

  If that doesn't work for some reason, you can still use the
  supplied <EM>perldoc</EM> script to view module information.  You
  might also look into getting a replacement man program.

  If something strange has gone wrong with your program and
  you're not sure where you should look for help, try the <STRONG>-w</STRONG>
  switch first.  It will often point out exactly where the
  trouble is.

<STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
  Perl is an interpreted language optimized for scanning
  arbitrary text files, extracting information from those text
  files, and printing reports based on that information.  It's
  also a good language for many system management tasks.  The
  language is intended to be practical (easy to use,
  efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant,
  minimal).  It combines (in the author's opinion, anyway)
  some of the best features of C, <STRONG>sed</STRONG>, <STRONG>awk</STRONG>, and <STRONG>sh</STRONG>, so people
  familiar with those languages should have little difficulty
  with it.  (Language historians will also note some vestiges
  of <STRONG>csh</STRONG>, Pascal, and even BASIC-PLUS.)  Expression syntax
  corresponds quite closely to C expression syntax.  Unlike
  most Unix utilities, Perl does not arbitrarily limit the
  size of your data--if you've got the memory, Perl can slurp
  in your whole file as a single string.  Recursion is of
  unlimited depth.  And the hash tables used by associative
  arrays grow as necessary to prevent degraded performance.
  Perl uses sophisticated pattern matching techniques to scan
  large amounts of data very quickly.  Although optimized for
  scanning text, Perl can also deal with binary data, and can
  make dbm files look like associative arrays.  Setuid Perl
  scripts are safer than C programs through a dataflow tracing
  mechanism which prevents many stupid security holes.  If you
  have a problem that would ordinarily use <STRONG>sed</STRONG> or <STRONG>awk</STRONG> or <STRONG>sh</STRONG>,
  but it exceeds their capabilities or must run a little
  faster, and you don't want to write the silly thing in C,
  then Perl may be for you.  There are also translators to
  turn your <STRONG>sed</STRONG> and <STRONG>awk</STRONG> scripts into Perl scripts.

  But wait, there's more...

  Perl version 5 is nearly a complete rewrite, and provides
  the following additional benefits:

  <STRONG>+</STRONG> Many usability enhancements
	   It is now possible to write much more readable Perl
	   code (even within regular expressions).  Formerly
	   cryptic variable names can be replaced by mnemonic
	   identifiers.  Error messages are more informative, and
	   the optional warnings will catch many of the mistakes a
	   novice might make.  This cannot be stressed enough.
	   Whenever you get mysterious behavior, try the <STRONG>-w</STRONG>
	   switch!!!  Whenever you don't get mysterious behavior,
	   try using <STRONG>-w</STRONG> anyway.

  <STRONG>+</STRONG> Simplified grammar
	   The new yacc grammar is one half the size of the old
	   one.  Many of the arbitrary grammar rules have been
	   regularized.  The number of reserved words has been cut
	   by 2/3.  Despite this, nearly all old Perl scripts will
	   continue to work unchanged.

  <STRONG>+</STRONG> Lexical scoping
	   Perl variables may now be declared within a lexical
	   scope, like "auto" variables in C.  Not only is this
	   more efficient, but it contributes to better privacy
	   for "programming in the large".

  <STRONG>+</STRONG> Arbitrarily nested data structures
	   Any scalar value, including any array element, may now
	   contain a reference to any other variable or
	   subroutine.  You can easily create anonymous variables
	   and subroutines.  Perl manages your reference counts
	   for you.

  <STRONG>+</STRONG> Modularity and reusability
	   The Perl library is now defined in terms of modules
	   which can be easily shared among various packages.  A
	   package may choose to import all or a portion of a
	   module's published interface.  Pragmas (that is,
	   compiler directives) are defined and used by the same
	   mechanism.

  <STRONG>+</STRONG> Object-oriented programming
	   A package can function as a class.  Dynamic multiple
	   inheritance and virtual methods are supported in a
	   straightforward manner and with very little new syntax.
	   Filehandles may now be treated as objects.

  <STRONG>+</STRONG> Embeddable and Extensible
	   Perl may now be embedded easily in your C or C++
	   application, and can either call or be called by your
	   routines through a documented interface.  The XS
	   preprocessor is provided to make it easy to glue your C
	   or C++ routines into Perl.  Dynamic loading of modules
	   is supported.

  <STRONG>+</STRONG> POSIX compliant
	   A major new module is the POSIX module, which provides
	   access to all available POSIX routines and definitions,
	   via object classes where appropriate.

  <STRONG>+</STRONG> Package constructors and destructors
	   The new BEGIN and END blocks provide means to capture
	   control as a package is being compiled, and after the
	   program exits.  As a degenerate case they work just
	   like awk's BEGIN and END when you use the <STRONG>-p</STRONG> or <STRONG>-n</STRONG>
	   switches.

  <STRONG>+</STRONG> Multiple simultaneous DBM implementations
	   A Perl program may now access DBM, NDBM, SDBM, GDBM,
	   and Berkeley DB files from the same script
	   simultaneously.  In fact, the old dbmopen interface has
	   been generalized to allow any variable to be tied to an
	   object class which defines its access methods.

  <STRONG>+</STRONG> Subroutine definitions may now be autoloaded
	   In fact, the AUTOLOAD mechanism also allows you to
	   define any arbitrary semantics for undefined subroutine
	   calls.  It's not just for autoloading.

  <STRONG>+</STRONG> Regular expression enhancements
	   You can now specify non-greedy quantifiers.  You can
	   now do grouping without creating a backreference.  You
	   can now write regular expressions with embedded
	   whitespace and comments for readability.  A consistent
	   extensibility mechanism has been added that is upwardly
	   compatible with all old regular expressions.

  Ok, that's <EM>definitely</EM> enough hype.

<STRONG>ENVIRONMENT</STRONG>
  HOME        Used if chdir has no argument.

  LOGDIR      Used if chdir has no argument and HOME is not
			  set.

  PATH        Used in executing subprocesses, and in finding
			  the script if <STRONG>-S</STRONG> is used.

  PERL5LIB    A colon-separated list of directories in which
			  to look for Perl library files before looking in
			  the standard library and the current directory.
			  If PERL5LIB is not defined, PERLLIB is used.
			  When running taint checks (because the script
			  was running setuid or setgid, or the <STRONG>-T</STRONG> switch
			  was used), neither variable is used.  The script
			  should instead say

				  use lib "/my/directory";


  PERL5DB     The command used to get the debugger code.  If
			  unset, uses

					  BEGIN { require 'perl5db.pl' }


  PERLLIB     A colon-separated list of directories in which
			  to look for Perl library files before looking in
			  the standard library and the current directory.
			  If PERL5LIB is defined, PERLLIB is not used.

  Apart from these, Perl uses no other environment variables,
  except to make them available to the script being executed,
  and to child processes.  However, scripts running setuid
  would do well to execute the following lines before doing
  anything else, just to keep people honest:

	  $ENV{'PATH'} = '/bin:/usr/bin';    # or whatever you need
	  $ENV{'SHELL'} = '/bin/sh' if defined $ENV{'SHELL'};
	  $ENV{'IFS'} = ''          if defined $ENV{'IFS'};

<STRONG>DIAGNOSTICS</STRONG>
  The <STRONG>-w</STRONG> switch produces some lovely diagnostics.

  See the <EM>perldiag</EM> manpage for explanations of all Perl's
  diagnostics.

  Compilation errors will tell you the line number of the
  error, with an indication of the next token or token type
  that was to be examined.  (In the case of a script passed to
  Perl via <STRONG>-e</STRONG> switches, each <STRONG>-e</STRONG> is counted as one line.)

  Setuid scripts have additional constraints that can produce
  error messages such as "Insecure dependency".  See the
  <EM>perlsec</EM> manpage.

  Did we mention that you should definitely consider using the
  <STRONG>-w</STRONG> switch?

<STRONG>BUGS</STRONG>
  The <STRONG>-w</STRONG> switch is not mandatory.

  Perl is at the mercy of your machine's definitions of
  various operations such as type casting, <EM>atof</EM>() and
  <EM>sprintf</EM>().  The latter can even trigger a coredump when
  passed ludicrous input values.

  If your stdio requires a seek or eof between reads and
  writes on a particular stream, so does Perl.  (This doesn't
  apply to <EM>sysread</EM>() and <EM>syswrite</EM>().)

  While none of the built-in data types have any arbitrary
  size limits (apart from memory size), there are still a few
  arbitrary limits:  a given identifier may not be longer than
  255 characters, and no component of your PATH may be longer
  than 255 if you use <STRONG>-S</STRONG>.  A regular expression may not
  compile to more than 32767 bytes internally.

  See the perl bugs database at <EM>http</EM>://<EM>perl.com</EM>/<EM>perl</EM>/<EM>bugs</EM>/.
  You may mail your bug reports (be sure to include full
  configuration information as output by the myconfig program
  in the perl source tree) to <EM>perlbug</EM>@<EM>perl.com</EM>.  If you've
  succeeded in compiling perl, the perlbug script in the
  utils/ subdirectory can be used to help mail in a bug
  report.

  Perl actually stands for Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish
  Lister, but don't tell anyone I said that.

<STRONG>NOTES</STRONG>
  The Perl motto is "There's more than one way to do it."
  Divining how many more is left as an exercise to the reader.

  The three principal virtues of a programmer are Laziness,
  Impatience, and Hubris.  See the Camel Book for why.
