You can find the most current version of Tkman at:

ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/people/phelps/tcltk/tkman.tar.Z

and

ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/people/phelps/tcltk/rman.tar.Z

which always link to the lastest versions of TkMan and its required
manual page filter, RosettaMan.

Thanks, 
Tom Phelps
