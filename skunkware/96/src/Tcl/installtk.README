A shell script that very carefully adds or removes softlinks from the
entire Tcl/TK distribution to /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib,
/usr/local/man, and /usr/local/include.  Makes installing a new version
of Tcl/TK absolutely painless and reversible.  Tested under HPUX, SunOS,
A/IX, UNICOS.  See the comments at the head of the script for more info.
