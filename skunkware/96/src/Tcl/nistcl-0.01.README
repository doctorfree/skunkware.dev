README for nistcl - a TCL interface to the SunOS NIS+ library

This is a TCL interface to the SunOS NIS+ library that I'm working on.
It is in its infant stages.  I'm just putting it out in the hope that
I'm not duplicating effort, or that no one duplicated my efforts.  I'm
looking for good implmentation ideas.  I'm hoping this will eventually
have a slick TK interface.
