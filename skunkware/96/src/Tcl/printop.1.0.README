printop : A printer-utility    

Printop is a utility, useful to view and affect printer queues. It's a
frontend to lpc, lpq and lprm with the full functionality of those.
This should prevent operators, systemadministrators or users from
learning all the printercommands of lpc, lprm and lpq and hacking around
on their keyboards.

Requirements:	lpd (lineprinter-daemon)
		lpc, lprm, lpq
		rsh
