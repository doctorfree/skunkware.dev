     <STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
          <STRONG>-colormap</STRONG> <STRONG>new</STRONG>                                                      ||
                              Specifies that the window should have a   |
                              new private colormap instead of using     |
                              the default colormap for the screen.

          <STRONG>-display</STRONG> <EM>display</EM>    Display (and screen) on which to display
                              window.

          <STRONG>-geometry</STRONG> <EM>geometry</EM>  Initial geometry to use for window.  If
                              this option is specified, its value is
                              stored in the <STRONG>geometry</STRONG> global variable
                              of the application's Tcl interpreter.

          <STRONG>-name</STRONG> <EM>name</EM>          Use <EM>name</EM> as the title to be displayed in
                              the window, and as the name of the
                              interpreter for <STRONG>send</STRONG> commands.

          <STRONG>-sync</STRONG>               Execute all X server commands
                              synchronously, so that errors are
                              reported immediately.  This will result
                              in much slower execution, but it is
                              useful for debugging.

          <STRONG>-visual</STRONG> <EM>visual</EM>                                                     ||
                              Specifies the visual to use for the       |
                              window.  <EM>Visual</EM> may have any of the       |
                              forms supported by the <STRONG>Tk_GetVisual</STRONG>       |
                              procedure.                                |

          <STRONG>--</STRONG>                                                                 ||
                              Pass all remaining arguments through to   |
                              the script's <STRONG>argv</STRONG> variable without        |
                              interpreting them.  This provides a       |
                              mechanism for passing arguments such as   |
                              <STRONG>-name</STRONG> to a script instead of having <STRONG>wish</STRONG>  |
                              interpret them.

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          <STRONG>Wish</STRONG> is a simple program consisting of the Tcl command
          language, the Tk toolkit, and a main program that reads
          commands from standard input or from a file.  It creates a
          main window and then processes Tcl commands.  If <STRONG>wish</STRONG> is      |
          invoked with no arguments, or with a first argument that      |
          starts with ``-'', then it reads Tcl commands interactively   |
          from standard input.  It will continue processing commands    |
          until all windows have been deleted or until end-of-file is   |
          reached on standard input.  If there exists a file <STRONG>.wishrc</STRONG>    |
          in the home directory of the user, <STRONG>wish</STRONG> evaluates the file    |
          as a Tcl script just before reading the first command from    |
          standard input.                                               |

          If <STRONG>wish</STRONG> is invoked with an initial <EM>fileName</EM> argument, then    |
          <EM>fileName</EM> is treated as the name of a script file.  <STRONG>Wish</STRONG> will  |
          evaluate the script in <EM>fileName</EM> (which presumably creates a   |
          user interface), then it will respond to events until all     |
          windows have been deleted.  Commands will not be read from    |
          standard input.  There is no automatic evaluation of <STRONG>.wishrc</STRONG>  |
          in this case, but the script file can always <STRONG>source</STRONG> it if     |
          desired.


     <STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
          <STRONG>Wish</STRONG> automatically processes all of the command-line options
          described in the <STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG> summary above.  Any other command-
          line arguments besides these are passed through to the
          application using the <STRONG>argc</STRONG> and <STRONG>argv</STRONG> variables described
          later.


     <STRONG>APPLICATION</STRONG> <STRONG>NAME</STRONG> <STRONG>AND</STRONG> <STRONG>CLASS</STRONG>
          The name of the application, which is used for purposes such  |
          as <STRONG>send</STRONG> commands, is taken from the <STRONG>-name</STRONG> option, if it is    |
          specified;  otherwise it is taken from <EM>fileName</EM>, if it is     |
          specified, or from the command name by which <STRONG>wish</STRONG> was         |
          invoked.  In the last two cases, if the name contains a       |
          ``/'' character, then only the characters after the last      |
          slash are used as the application name.                       |

          The class of the application, which is used for purposes      |
          such as specifying options with a <STRONG>RESOURCE_MANAGER</STRONG> property   |
          or .Xdefaults file, is the same as its name except that the   |
          first letter is capitalized.


     <STRONG>VARIABLES</STRONG>
          <STRONG>Wish</STRONG> sets the following Tcl variables:

          <STRONG>argc</STRONG>           Contains a count of the number of <EM>arg</EM>
                         arguments (0 if none), not including the
                         options described above.

          <STRONG>argv</STRONG>           Contains a Tcl list whose elements are the
                         <EM>arg</EM> arguments that follow a <STRONG>--</STRONG> option or       |
                         don't match any of the options described in    |
                         OPTIONS above, in order, or an empty string
                         if there are no such arguments.

          <STRONG>argv0</STRONG>          Contains <EM>fileName</EM> if it was specified.
                         Otherwise, contains the name by which <STRONG>wish</STRONG>
                         was invoked.

          <STRONG>geometry</STRONG>       If the <STRONG>-geometry</STRONG> option is specified, <STRONG>wish</STRONG>     |
                         copies its value into this variable.  If the   |
                         variable still exists after <EM>fileName</EM> has been  |
                         evaluated, <STRONG>wish</STRONG> uses the value of the          |
                         variable in a <STRONG>wm</STRONG> <STRONG>geometry</STRONG> command to set the   |
                         main window's geometry.

          <STRONG>tcl_interactive</STRONG>
                         Contains 1 if <STRONG>wish</STRONG> is reading commands
                         interactively (<EM>fileName</EM> was not specified and
                         standard input is a terminal-like device), 0
                         otherwise.


     <STRONG>SCRIPT</STRONG> <STRONG>FILES</STRONG>
          If you create a Tcl script in a file whose first line is
               <STRONG>#!/usr/local/bin/wish</STRONG>
          then you can invoke the script file directly from your shell
          if you mark it as executable.  This assumes that <STRONG>wish</STRONG> has
          been installed in the default location in /usr/local/bin;
          if it's installed somewhere else then you'll have to modify
          the above line to match.  Many UNIX systems do not allow the
          <STRONG>#!</STRONG> line to exceed about 30 characters in length, so be sure
          that the <STRONG>wish</STRONG> executable can be accessed with a short file
          name.

          An even better approach is to start your script files with
          the following three lines:                                    |
               <STRONG>#!/bin/sh</STRONG>                                                |
               <STRONG>#</STRONG> <STRONG>the</STRONG> <STRONG>next</STRONG> <STRONG>line</STRONG> <STRONG>restarts</STRONG> <STRONG>using</STRONG> <STRONG>wish</STRONG> <STRONG>\</STRONG>                    |
               <STRONG>exec</STRONG> <STRONG>wish</STRONG> <STRONG>"$0"</STRONG> <STRONG>"$@"</STRONG>                                      |
          This approach has three advantages over the approach in the   |
          previous paragraph.  First, the location of the <STRONG>wish</STRONG> binary   |
          doesn't have to be hard-wired into the script:  it can be     |
          anywhere in your shell search path.  Second, it gets around   |
          the 30-character file name limit in the previous approach.    |
          Third, this approach will work even if <STRONG>wish</STRONG> is itself a       |
          shell script (this is done on some systems in order to        |
          handle multiple architectures or operating systems:  the      |
          <STRONG>wish</STRONG> script selects one of several binaries to run).  The     |
          three lines cause both <STRONG>sh</STRONG> and <STRONG>wish</STRONG> to process the script,     |
          but the <STRONG>exec</STRONG> is only executed by <STRONG>sh</STRONG>.  <STRONG>sh</STRONG> processes the        |
          script first;  it treats the second line as a comment and     |
          executes the third line.  The <STRONG>exec</STRONG> statement cause the shell  |
          to stop processing and instead to start up <STRONG>wish</STRONG> to reprocess  |
          the entire script.  When <STRONG>wish</STRONG> starts up, it treats all three  |
          lines as comments, since the backslash at the end of the      |
          second line causes the third line to be treated as part of    |
          the comment on the second line.


     <STRONG>PROMPTS</STRONG>
          When <STRONG>wish</STRONG> is invoked interactively it normally prompts for
          each command with ``<STRONG>%</STRONG> ''.  You can change the prompt by
          setting the variables <STRONG>tcl_prompt1</STRONG> and <STRONG>tcl_prompt2</STRONG>.  If
          variable <STRONG>tcl_prompt1</STRONG> exists then it must consist of a Tcl
          script to output a prompt;  instead of outputting a prompt
          <STRONG>wish</STRONG> will evaluate the script in <STRONG>tcl_prompt1</STRONG>.  The variable
          <STRONG>tcl_prompt2</STRONG> is used in a similar way when a newline is typed
          but the current command isn't yet complete; if <STRONG>tcl_prompt2</STRONG>
          isn't set then no prompt is output for incomplete commands.
