Notes on building Tk4.1 for skunkware
--------------------------------------

Run dir (prefix and exec-prefix) are set to default to /usr/local.
installation (INSTALL_ROOT) is set to install into 
    ../dist ( tk4.1/dist)


To build
--------
    I wanted to build both static and shared libraries and interpreters but I
didn't want to change from the std config files so we do two configure and 
builds (one each). 
    shared lib interp will be wish4.1s
    static interp will be     wish4.1

cd into ./unix.

    run script ./skunkMake

which does :

configure as ./configure 
    make to make a static interpreter and library
    rename the static interpreter 
    remove the .o files

configure again ./configure --enable-shared
    make to make shared libs and interpreter that uses them

Copy the static interp and lib to dist by hand

make install


tests
-----
these tests give failure messages 
    clipboard-6.2 Tk_ClipboardAppend procedure
    grid-2.2 testing bbox
    grid-3.1 -sticky
    select-9.3 SelCvtToX and SelCvtFromX procedures
    select-10.3 ConvertSelection procedure
    select-10.4 ConvertSelection procedure
    select-12.5 DefaultSelection procedure
