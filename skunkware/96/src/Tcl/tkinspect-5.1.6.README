			tkinspect, release 5.1.6
			    (June 23, 1995)

This is the 5th release of my browser for Tk programs.  This version
of tkinspect requires Tk 4.0 or better (tested only with Tk 4.0b4,
and things will probably fail on previous betas).

To install: type "wish4.0 install.tcl", fill out the form, and hit the
install button.

tkinspect should be pretty easy to use, hopefully you can learn how to
use it by selecting an interpreter (via the File, Select Interpreter
menu item) and then clicking on things.  There is also an online help
system.

tkinspect itself is public domain, you may do whatever you want with
it.  However, tkinspect uses a hacked down library that I've written
at LBL, so the files in stl-lite are copyright 1995 Lawrence Berkeley
Lab.  See stl-lite/COPYRIGHT for the full copyright notice.  (STL will
soon be renamed to SNTL to avoid conflicting with the C++ template
library.)

Please send me any comments or suggestions you might have, along with
any bugs that you may encounter.
