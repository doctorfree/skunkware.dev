This is a TCL program that automatically classifies mail messages.  It is 
intended to be invoked from the user's .forward (with no arguments).  I wrote 
it as a replacement for MH's slocal, but people can use it for other purposes, 
since it allows arbitrary TCL code in the action parts of the classification 
lines.  The header of the program is pretty detailed about how it works and how 
to use it (it's also a pretty simple program).
