1/4/94 - xbible

This is a simple X front end interface to bible: BRS Release 4.00
and runs with Tcl and Tk (any recently version should be fine).
I write this in my spare time and for the reason that I like every 
application has an X interface.
Please e-mail me (siumk@cs.ust.hk) if you found any bugs in the program.


All the best,

Alan..

P.S. I don't see any restriction on this program as long as you keep my name 
in the program.
