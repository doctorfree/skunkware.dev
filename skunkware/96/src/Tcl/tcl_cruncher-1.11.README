 tcl_cruncher : A TCL pseudo compiler and/or syntax checker
   Copyright 9/1994 by Laurent Demailly (dl@hplyot.obspm.fr)

 This program transforms nice Tcl/TclX/Itcl sources into an ugly but
 faster standard output : it removes all unneeded white spaces, ; ,
 all comments, etc... the result is unreadable, but can be twice as
 fast & as small than original.
 It can also be used to check syntax of your programs.
 It does all this very fast.

 Usage: tcl_cruncher [-t] [-1] [-c] [-s] [-d more-definitions-file] file names
                     or '-' for standard output.

 using -t shows the all the commands of the script, in a 'calling tree' form
           on stderr (use it like in tcl_cruncher -tcs  ... |& more for best
           result) it can help to detect problems. Experimental feature.

 using -1 keeps first comments (ie #! /usr/local/bin/wish -f and (c)...)

 using -s disable switch & brace in comments warnings and processed
          line count output

 using -c performs check only (no stdoutput)

 using -d option provides for adding new recognized commands without
   recompiling, ie you have your own command 'cmd' that have 1 argument
   which is a script, like the itcl 'destructor' command, just put in a
   text file the line : "cmd destructor" and cmd will be analyzed !

 Example: "tcl_cruncher *.tcl > lib.tclc" 'compiles' everything into lib.tclc
          "tcl_cruncher -cs *.tcl" makes a good syntax checker

 to use it from inside tcl, re-define for instance :
   proc source file {uplevel #0 [exec tcl_cruncher -s $file]}
 and all your sourced files will then be auto-magically speeded up

 Warnings:
        + switch ?o? v {p1 {s1} p2 {s2}} construct is not optimized
          you should do it by hand for full speed, or use the
          switch ?o? v p1 {s1} p2 {s2} ... construct...
        + "if ... elseif ..." can be misinterpreted in tree mode. (-t)

 It compiles with gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall -O without any problem
 (tested on hpux : add -D_HPUX_SOURCE and linux) if you don't have
 an ansi compiler, grab gcc, or ansi2kr, or remove prototypes & const...
