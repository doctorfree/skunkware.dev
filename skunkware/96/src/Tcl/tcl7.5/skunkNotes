Notes on building Tcl7.5 for skunkware
--------------------------------------

Run dir (prefix and exec-prefix) are set to default to /usr/local.
installation (INSTALL_ROOT) is set to install into 
    ../dist ( tcl7.5/dist)


To build
--------
    I wanted to build both static and shared libraries and interpreters but I
didn't want to change from the std config files so we do two configure and 
builds (one each). 
    shared lib interp will be tclsh
    static interp will be     tclsh75s

Note that there IS a patch that supports this (and many other things from the 
look of it - its the file tcl7.5plus.patch.gz in tcl7.5. 
This has NOT been applied to this src tree ).




cd into ./unix.

    run script ./skunkMake

which does :

configure as ./configure 
    make to make a static interpreter and library
    rename the static interpreter 
    remove the .o files

configure again ./configure --enable-shared
    make to make shared libs and interpreter that uses them

Copy the static interp and lib to dist by hand

make install


tests
-----

tests socket-2.9 socket conflict
      socket-3.1 socket conflict
      socket-9.8 socket conflict
    'Fail' in that they expect a command to fail where a socket/port is
        already in use and it doesn't ... 
    I haven't done anything about tracking this down, mark surmises that its
    something screwed up with SCO sockets....
