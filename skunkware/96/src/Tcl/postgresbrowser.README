This is an experimental postgres frontend, created with XF2.2 
It needs a wish extended with TclX6.5c and PQTcl.
Note that this is only a very first draft version, I posted it here
to get some feedback on its appearance and functionality.

It assumes a postgres database called 'template1' is available for lookup
of the database names.
