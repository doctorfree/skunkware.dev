<STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
  <STRONG>mpeg_play</STRONG> decodes and displays mpeg-1 encoded bitstreams on
  systems running X11.  The player will create a new window,
  display the bitstream, and exit.  Any error messages or
  notices are sent to stderr.

<STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
  <STRONG>-nob</STRONG> : causes the player to ignore and not display any B
	   frames.

  <STRONG>-nop</STRONG> : causes the player to ignore and not display any P and
	   B frames.

  <STRONG>-display</STRONG> <STRONG>display_name</STRONG> : causes the player to open the window
	   on the display <EM>display_name</EM>.

  <STRONG>-quality</STRONG> <STRONG>{on|off}</STRONG> : forces player to choose output quality
	   over speed when on, and vice versa when off.  When
	   quality is on, the player uses a computationally
	   expensive IDCT and also improves playback through
	   improved handling of half pixel motion vectors.  The
	   default can be set to on if you compile mpeg_play with
	   the flag -DQUALITY.

  <STRONG>-dither</STRONG> <STRONG>dither_option</STRONG> : selects from a variety of dither
	   options. The possible values are:

	   ordered - ordered dither.

	   ordered2 - a faster ordered dither. This is the
			default.

	   mbordered - ordered dithering at the macroblock level.
			Although there is a noticeable decrease in dither
			quality, this is the fastest dither available.

	   fs4 - Floyd-Steinberg dithering with 4 error values
			propagated.

	   fs2 - Floyd-Steinberg dithering with 2 error values
			propagated.

	   fs2fast - Fast Floyd-Steinberg dithering with 2 error
			values propagated.

	   hybrid - Hybrid dithering, a combination of ordered
			dithering for the luminance channel and Floyd-
			Steinberg 2 error dithering for the chrominance
			channels. Errors are NOT propagated properly and
			are dropped all together every two pixels in
			either direction.

	   hybrid2 - Hybrid dithering as above, but with error
			propagation among pixels.

	   2x2 - A dithering technique using a 2x2 pixel area for
			each pixel. The image displayed is 4 times larger
			than the original image encoded. Random error
			terms are added to each pixel to break up contours
			and gradients.

	   gray - Grayscale dithering. The image is dithered into
			128 grayscales. Chrominance information is thrown
			away.

	   gray256 - Grayscale dithering. The image is dithered
			into 256 grayscales (requires private colormap).
			Chrominance information is thrown away.

	   color - Full color display (only available on 16/24 bit
			color displays).

	   color2 - Full color display with increased size (only
			available on 16/24 bit color displays).

	   none - no dithering is done, no image is displayed.
			Used to time decoding process.

	   mono - Floyd-Steinberg dithering for monochrome
			displays.

	   threshold - Floyd-simple dithering for monochrome
			displays.

	   ppm - Write a PPM file for each frame.

  <STRONG>-loop</STRONG> : makes the player loop back to the beginning after
	   reaching the end.

  <STRONG>-owncm</STRONG> : makes the player use a private colormap for the
	   window.

  <STRONG>-step</STRONG> : requires the user to press return for each new
	   frame.

  <STRONG>-seek</STRONG> <STRONG>offset</STRONG> : before playing the movie, seek to the given
	   offset in the file (useful for large movies).  In this
	   case -end is redefined to give the number of frames to
	   play, and -start has no meaning.  The offset should
	   point to a Sequence or (closed) GOP header, but data
	   will be discarded until one is found.  The initial
	   sequence header will be parsed before the seek.  The
	   skipped sections must not change the quantization
	   matrices or the results are undefined.

  <STRONG>-start</STRONG> <STRONG>num</STRONG> : Waits to start display until this frame number
	   (previous frames are parsed).

  <STRONG>-end</STRONG> <STRONG>num</STRONG> : ends display at this frame number (except when
	   -seek is used).

  <STRONG>-gamma</STRONG> <STRONG>gamma_correction_param</STRONG> : specifies the amount of
	   gamma correction.  Default is 1.0.  Use higher values
	   if movie looks dark and hard to see.

  <STRONG>-framerate</STRONG> <STRONG>num</STRONG> : sets the framerate of the playback to num
	   frames per second.  A value of 0 indicates that the
	   stream should be played as fast as possible.  The
	   default is to play at the rate specified in the stream
	   (if possible).  Note this is merely a framerate
	   limiter, it will not discard frames to meet the rate.

  <STRONG>-controls</STRONG> <STRONG>{on|off|none}</STRONG> : determines the initial interactive
	   X user interface control bar state (if available).  The
	   value on (default) opens the control bar at
	   initialization and enters pause mode after displaying
	   the first frame.  The value off leaves the control bar
	   initially hidden and begins playback without pausing
	   (similar to the old behavior).  The control bar can be
	   toggled on and off at any time by clicking in the video
	   display window, unless the -controls none option is
	   specified, in which case the control bar is unavailable
	   and playback functions as though the player were built
	   without interactive controls (exactly the old
	   behavior).

  <STRONG>-quiet</STRONG> : suppresses printing of frame numbers, timing
	   information, and most error messages.

  <STRONG>-eachstat</STRONG> : causes statistics to be displayed after each
	   frame. Only valid when compiled with -DANALYSIS.

  <STRONG>-shmem_off</STRONG> : turns shared memory off.

  <STRONG>-l_range</STRONG> <STRONG>num_colors</STRONG> : sets the number of colors assigned to
	   the luminance component when dithering the image.  The
	   product of l_range, cr_range and cb_range should be
	   less than the number of colors on the display.

  <STRONG>-cr_range</STRONG> <STRONG>num_colors</STRONG> : sets the number of colors assigned to
	   the red component of the chrominance range when
	   dithering the image.  The product of l_range, cr_range
	   and cb_range should be less than the number of colors
	   on the display.

  <STRONG>-cb_range</STRONG> <STRONG>num_colors</STRONG> : sets the number of colors assigned to
	   the blue component of the chrominance range when
	   dithering the image.  The product of l_range, cr_range
	   and cb_range should be less than the number of colors
	   on the display.

  <STRONG>-no_display</STRONG> : dithers, but does not display, usually used
	   for testing and timing purposes.

<STRONG>NOTES</STRONG>
  The player expects video streams only. It can handle
  multiplexed MPEG streams (video+audio streams) by discarding
  the audio.

  Some streams do not end with the proper sequence end code
  and will probably generate an "Improper sequence end code."
  error when done playing.

  This player can play XING data files. Be aware that XING
  makes no use of temporal redundancy or motion vector
  information. In other words, they do not use any P or B
  frames in their streams. Instead, XING data is simply a
  sequence of I frames. Since I frames take significantly
  longer to decode, performance of the player using XING data
  is not representative of the player's ability.

  The player does not play MPEG-1 D-frame streams, but they
  are a rarity.

  If the player is compiled without the controlbar, then it
  can play multiple streams in different windows.

<STRONG>VERSION</STRONG>
  This is version 2.1a, containing some new features since
  2.0, and several bug fixes.  It is a major change since
  version 1.0.

<STRONG>BUGS</STRONG>
  The only known bug is that multiple mpeg_plays cannot seem
  to be run simultaneously on a multiprocessor SPARC 20 or a
  SparcCenter 2000E using shared memory (in particular:  "On a
  bi-processor Sparc 20/20 sparc-processor 2000E running
  Solaris 2.3 or 2.4, it is not possible to run two concurrent
  'mpeg_play -loop' on the same bitstream.  One of the
  mpeg_play dies when it loops."  This may be a problem with
  the X shared memory library and not our code.)
