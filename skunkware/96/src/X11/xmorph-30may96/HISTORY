  Fixed a subtle but important bug in warp.c line 189:
      /* scan convert vertical splines of S and I */
      hermite3_array(yrow1, xrow1, mesh_height, indx, map1, img_height);
      hermite3_array(yrow1, xrow2, mesh_height, indx, map2, img_height);
                   ^^^^^
    The report comes from Mike Hoefelein
    <hoefelei@informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de>

    The effect was to make the warped image conform exactly to the
    mesh.  Before, there was a descrepency between the mesh location
    and the image.  This should have been obvious earlier by simply
    warping the checkerboard test image, but I had ignored it until
    Mike pointed it out to me.

  Fixed a hideous memory allocation bug.
  TrueColor works for TrueColor default visual.
  TrueColor does not work for nondefault TrueColor, because Xt does
    not support such a use of Visual Class.  This ends up being a
    rather subtle and difficult issue, which has been discussed at
    length by people who want to use TrueColor visuals on displays
    that have another kind of default visual class but which can
    support TrueColor.  See the X Authority Web site.

14sep95:
  Removed TrueColor support for nondefault TrueColor machines, but
  left hooks in.  I can't figure out why it doesn't work.

13sep95:
  Made some modifications due to reports by xmorph users.
    In particular, there were more divide-by-zero events happening in
    the warping code.  Much of this was due to Wolberg.  I've found
    several errors in Wolberg's original code, and he's been made aware
    of these changes.  One good thing about these changes is that they
    (in Wolberg's opinion) sufficiently change the code such that there
    isn't a copyright problem using the code.  Wolberg has granted
    permission to me to use the code in any case.
  Added my_free to spl-array in hermite3_array (memory leak).
  Changed free() to my_free in various routines.
  Changed xi loop bound in reample_array in warp.c to (len-1)
  WA contributed these changes:
    added TrueColor support (changed xbm_gray and dither_image)
      I have to admit that I don't fully understand these changes yet
      because I haven't looked into TrueColor displays because I
      haven't hacked them.  If there is a problem with the TrueColor
      code then let me know, but I might not be able to help.  -- MJG
    fixed memory leak in sequence.c to free a temporary mesh.
    changed box to paned widget to allow scrolling

14jul94:
  Modified spline routines to fit my personal library better.
  Moved some routines from spline.c to spl-array.c
  Miniscule formatting changes in my_malloc.c.

Nov94:
  Changed my email address to Colorado address in documentation files.
  Released at MIT.

22jul94:
  More diddling with the tga routines.  Colormap and pixel stuff.

21jul94:
  removed load_tga_cmap_entry, and changed the way targa cmaps are stored.
  Added ppmtotga, tgatoppm, cjpeg, djpeg to the man page.

release 5 (xmorph-20jul94)
20jul94:
  Fixed load_tga_image: first row of upside-down images was wrong.
  Removed (or changed) references to tga.h where inappopriate.
  Added automatic image compression in save_img if loaded image was
    compressed.  Also checks pixel_size.
  Added fields to the rgba_image_t for compression, cmaps, pixel size.
  Added RLE compression to Targa save routines.
  Added a bounds check in load_tga_image for corrupt Targas.
  Added more labels to the scrollbars to be more clear.
  Alligned scrollbar region.
  Added a missing "#include <Scrollbar.h>" in xmorph.c
  Added a missing "\n\" in help_menu.c

Alpha version:  these releases come all too often.
19jul94:
  Ximage array allocation fixed in diw_map.c (factor of 4 deal).
Fourth release (xmorph-19jul94.2): unannounced
  Ximage array indexing fixed in dither_image.
Third release (xmorph-19jul94.1): unannounced
  Modified spline code to continue (not abort) when spline abcissa out of range.

Second release (xmorph-18jul94): unannounced
Tue Jul 19 02:57:37 EDT 1994
  This release was not quite ready, but I was being flooded with
  reports that xdiw had vanished, and I needed to put something up to
  keep the email flux down.

xmorph-18jul94:
  Removed spline code from warp.c.
  Incorporated use of general purpose hermite spline routines I wrote in 1993.
  Fixed bug in hermite spline routine (for point at last knot).
  Changed the name from xdiw to xmorph.

xdiw-15jul94:
  Changed the module organization of the rgba_image_t definition.
  Separated tga-24.c and (new file) tga-write.c
  Added size-8 write to save_tga_pixel (untested)
  [Approaching a common tga library for xdiw and showtime]

xdiw-08jul94:
  Added authorship and release date info in internal "About..." page.
  Made README more like what the X Consortium wants for contrib.
  Separated application and widget code in diw_map.c and xdiw.c.
  Wrote a short man page for xdiw.

First release (xdiw-07jul94): announced
Thu Jul  7 16:36:58 EDT 1994:

  It's at a stage I'd call "alpha release" if I were into that sort of
  jargon, which means this program will probably dump core a lot.
  Please report such incidents, along with any solutions, back to me.

  I've used it to morph images of Wendy and myself, with significant
  success.  I put the images onto video and it looks really nice.

  I've never seen any other morphing program at all, so I'm sure my idea
  of a GUI differs greatly from the "professional" commercial packages,
  but according to one guy I showed this to, my way is better.  If you
  disagree, please tell me what I can do to make my program more usable.
  I already have a lot of ideas about how to make it better--  features
  to add, etc., but at the moment it's pretty usable (enough so that
  I've decided to release it.)

  It's self documenting, and I've compiled and run the program on SunOS
  machines, Solaris machines, SGI's, and HPUX, although on the HP it's
  slower than molasses.  It _flies_ on the Reality Engine.

  I'm trying to figure out how to get this widely distributed.  As far
  as I know, it's the only publically available image morphing program,
  for X or any other platform.  If any of you know of another publically
  available morphing program, please let me know so I can kill myself.

  I also wrote a program that rapidly displays the images generated by
  Xdiw (for X or MSDOS), for those of you who don't have a high speed
  JPEG CoDec like I do :)
