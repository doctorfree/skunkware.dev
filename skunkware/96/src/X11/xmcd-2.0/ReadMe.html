<STRONG>NAME</STRONG>
  xmcd - CD digital audio player utility for X11/Motif


<STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>
  <STRONG>xmcd</STRONG> [<EM>toolkitoption</EM> ...] [-<EM>dev</EM> <EM>device</EM>] [-<EM>debug</EM>] [-<STRONG>c</STRONG> <EM>device</EM>]
  [-<STRONG>X</STRONG>] [-<STRONG>o</STRONG>]


<STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
  <EM>Xmcd</EM> is a program that allows the use of the CD-ROM drive as
  a full-featured stereo compact-disc player for the X window
  system.  See <EM>cda(1)</EM> for the command-line CD player.  <EM>xmcd</EM>
  and <EM>cda</EM> uses the same configuration and support files.

  Most of the features found on real CD players are available
  in <EM>xmcd</EM>, such as shuffle and repeat, track programming
  functions, a numeric keypad and track warp slider for direct
  track access.  Additional functions include sample play, A
  to B segment play, volume control, balance control, etc.
  Several automation options are also available on CD load,
  eject, play completion and program exit.  A Channel Routing
  feature allow you to select from several stereo or mono
  routing options.  The volume control slider taper
  characteristics can also be altered.

  A CD database feature allows the CD artist/title and track
  titles, and other associated general purpose text to be
  maintained and loaded as the program is started or when a CD
  is inserted.  The CD database contents can be on your local
  system or queried from a remote CD database server host.

  Full feature-specific pop-up help is available for all
  controls, indicators, text input fields, and lists.

  On systems with more than one CD-ROM drive, multiple
  invocations of <EM>xmcd</EM> can be used to operate each drive
  independently.

  <EM>Xmcd</EM> is designed to be easy to use, as the main window is
  purposely made to resemble a real CD player front panel.
  All other pop-up windows are also designed to be as
  intuitive as possible.  Moreover, while the use of a mouse
  is natural with <EM>xmcd</EM>, all functionality can also be operated
  via the keyboard.  This is in conformance to the guidelines
  published in the <EM>OSF</EM>/<EM>Motif</EM> <EM>Style</EM> <EM>Guide</EM> from the Open
  Software Foundation.

  The internal architecture of <EM>xmcd</EM> is designed to be easily
  portable to many UNIX operating system variants, and
  adaptable to the myriad of CD-ROM drives available.

<STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
  All standard <EM>Xt</EM> <EM>Intrinsics</EM> toolkit options are supported.
  In addition, <EM>xmcd</EM> supports the following options:

  -<EM>dev</EM> <EM>device</EM>
	   Specifies the path name to the raw CD-ROM device.  If
	   this option is not used, the default device to be used
	   is the first drive set up with the <EM>xmcd</EM> configuration
	   program (See below).

  -<EM>debug</EM>
	   Causes verbose debugging diagnostics to be printed on
	   <EM>stderr</EM>.

  -<STRONG>c</STRONG> <EM>device</EM> (<EM>Solaris</EM> <STRONG>2</STRONG> <EM>only)</EM>
	   Same as the -<EM>dev</EM> option.

  -<STRONG>X</STRONG> (<EM>Solaris</EM> <STRONG>2</STRONG> <EM>only)</EM>
	   Causes the <STRONG>exitOnEject</STRONG> parameter to be set to True.

  -<STRONG>o</STRONG> (<EM>Solaris</EM> <STRONG>2</STRONG> <EM>only)</EM>
	   This option has no effect.

  The -<STRONG>c</STRONG>, -<STRONG>X</STRONG> and -<STRONG>o</STRONG> options are provided only on the Solaris 2
  platform for compatibility with the <EM>action_workman</EM>.<EM>so</EM> auto-
  startup program, running under the Solaris 2 Volume Manager.
  See the README file in the <EM>xmcd</EM> distribution about
  configuring <EM>xmcd</EM> for the Solaris 2 Volume Manager.


<STRONG>X</STRONG> <STRONG>RESOURCES</STRONG>
  <EM>Xmcd</EM> has many adjustable X resources to customize its look
  and feel, as well as its behavior.  Notably, the colors of
  virtually every feature on <EM>xmcd</EM>'s windows can be changed, as
  well as the text fonts.  All text labels can also be changed
  (for example, to another language).

  There are too many resources to list here, but the resource
  names and their defaults (plus descriptive comments) can be
  found in the <STRONG>LIBDIR</STRONG>/<EM>app</EM>-<EM>defaults</EM>/<EM>XMcd</EM> file (where LIBDIR is
  typically /<EM>usr</EM>/<EM>lib</EM>/<EM>X11)</EM>.  It is not recommended that you
  change values in the <STRONG>LIBDIR</STRONG>/<EM>app</EM>-<EM>defaults</EM>/<EM>XMcd</EM> file, unless
  you want the changes to be forced upon all users of <EM>xmcd</EM> on
  the system.  Instead, make a copy of this file, change the
  copy as you see fit, then place it in your home directory.
  Your custom resource settings will then override the
  defaults when <EM>xmcd</EM> is subsequently started.  Alternatively,
  you may also place specific resources you wish to override
  in the .<EM>Xdefaults</EM> file in your home directory.


<STRONG>DEVICE</STRONG> <STRONG>CONFIGURATION</STRONG>
  The X resources described in the previous section affect the
  general appearance and behavior of <EM>xmcd</EM>. There are two
  additional configuration files which are used to adapt <EM>xmcd</EM>
  to your site requirements.  The first of these contain
  common parameters, and the second contain configurable
  parameters that must vary on a per-drive basis.  For
  example, in some cases <EM>xmcd</EM> must operate the drive
  differently depending upon the brand and model of the drive.
  Thus, there must be a separate configuration file for these
  parameters <EM>per</EM>-<EM>device</EM>.  The common parameters file is
  <STRONG>XMCDLIB</STRONG>/<EM>config</EM>/<EM>common.cfg</EM> <STRONG>and</STRONG> <STRONG>the</STRONG> <STRONG>device-specific</STRONG> <STRONG>parameters</STRONG>
  <STRONG>file</STRONG> <STRONG>is</STRONG> <STRONG>XMCDLIB</STRONG>/<EM>config</EM>/<STRONG>DEVICE</STRONG> (where XMCDLIB is typically
  /<EM>usr</EM>/<EM>lib</EM>/<EM>X11</EM>/<EM>xmcd</EM> and DEVICE is the base name of the raw
  device special file for the CD-ROM drive ; e.g.,
  /<EM>usr</EM>/<EM>lib</EM>/<EM>X11</EM>/<EM>xmcd</EM>/<EM>config</EM>/<EM>rcd0)</EM>.  A configuration program
  <STRONG>XMCDLIB</STRONG>/<EM>config</EM>/<EM>config.sh</EM> is provided to make maintaining
  these configuration file easy (Note: on SCO systems the
  configuration program can also be invoked as "<EM>mkdev</EM> <EM>xmcd</EM>").

  You should always use the configuration program to set the
  configuration parameters when installing <EM>xmcd</EM> for the first
  time, or when the CD-ROM hardware configuration has changed.
  If this is not done then <EM>xmcd</EM> will probably not operate
  correctly with your CD-ROM drive.

  <STRONG>WARNING:</STRONG> If <EM>xmcd</EM> is not correctly configured, you may cause
  <EM>xmcd</EM> to deliver commands that are not supported by your CD-
  ROM drive.  Under some environments this may lead to system
  hang or crash.

  You can override some of the device-specific configuration
  parameters by adding your own configuration files.  <EM>Xmcd</EM>
  will also look in the <STRONG>HOME</STRONG>/.<EM>xmcdcfg</EM>/<EM>common.cfg</EM> and
  <STRONG>HOME</STRONG>/.<EM>xmcdcfg</EM>/<STRONG>DEVICE</STRONG> files for common and device-specific
  parameters (where HOME is your home directory and DEVICE is
  as specified above).  Parameters found in this file will
  override the system defaults (except those parameters that
  cannot be overridden; see the comments in the
  <STRONG>XMCDLIB</STRONG>/<EM>config</EM>/<EM>device.cfg</EM> for details).


<STRONG>USING</STRONG> <STRONG>XMCD</STRONG>
  The basic functions of <EM>xmcd</EM> are designed to operate the same
  way as on a real stereo CD player.  The pictorial symbols
  used on the main window buttons are intended to illustrate
  the function in a non-language-specific manner.  You can
  also change all main window buttons to display a text label
  instead of the pictorial symbols, by clicking the <STRONG>display</STRONG>
  check-box button (the "A" symbol enclosed in a box) located
  at the upper left hand corner of the main window.

  The CD database and track programming functions are operated
  via the CD Database/Track Program Editor pop-up subwindow.
  You activate the subwindow by pressing the <STRONG>cddb/prog</STRONG> button
  below).

  There will not be a per-item description of all the
  features, because full on-line help is available (See
  "ONLINE HELP" below).


<STRONG>ONLINE</STRONG> <STRONG>HELP</STRONG>
  For general information about <EM>xmcd</EM>, click the <STRONG>help</STRONG> (question
  mark symbol) button on the <EM>xmcd</EM> main window.  You can also
  get specific help information about each button, control,
  indicator, text entry area, selection list by positioning
  the mouse cursor over the desired item, then clicking the
  third mouse button.  A pop-up window will appear, containing
  the relevant help text.


<STRONG>TRACK</STRONG> <STRONG>PROGRAMMING</STRONG>
  You can program <EM>xmcd</EM> to play only certain tracks, in a
  custom sequence.  To do so, invoke the CD Database window
  (by pressing the <STRONG>cddb/prog</STRONG> button on the main window).
  Select the desired track by clicking on the entry in the
  <STRONG>Track</STRONG> <STRONG>list,</STRONG> and click the <STRONG>Add</STRONG> button to add to the play
  sequence.  Notice that the track number appears in the <STRONG>Play</STRONG>
  <STRONG>sequence</STRONG> text field.  You can also type the track numbers,
  separated with commas, directly in the <STRONG>Play</STRONG> <STRONG>sequence</STRONG> field.
  Repeat until all desired tracks have been entered, then
  press the <STRONG>Play/Pause</STRONG> button (on the main window) to start
  the program play.

  When a program sequence is defined, the <STRONG>prog</STRONG> indicator in
  the main window display area "illuminates".  To erase the
  program sequence, press the <STRONG>Clear</STRONG> button on the CD
  Database/Program Editor window.


  The CD Database feature of <EM>xmcd</EM> allows you to enter the CD
  artist/title, track titles, other free-form text (such as
  band information, lyrics, etc.) associated with the disc and
  tracks, and a track play program.  After this information is
  typed in and saved to a database file, it will automatically
  appear on the <EM>xmcd</EM> CD Database window when the same CD is
  inserted again.

  You must perform a "save" operation (press the <STRONG>Save</STRONG> button)
  after typing in the database information before ejecting the
  CD or exiting, or the information will be lost.  If this is
  the first time this CD database entry is being stored, you
  will be asked to select a category (rock, classical, jazz,
  etc.) under which to classify the CD.  The category is used
  by <EM>xmcd</EM> to determine the actual directory in the filesystem
  to write the database file.

  You must type the CD information into the database because
  the CD's table of contents (TOC) contains only the number of
  tracks and the starting address of each track, but not the
  actual disc and track titles.

  The CD database window should prove to be intuitive to use.
  You may use the on-line help system to obtain specific help
  information about the various buttons and items.

  The CD database information is stored in text files, one per
  CD, in a designated directory (category).  The path of this
  directory is <STRONG>XMCDLIB</STRONG>/<EM>cddb</EM>/<STRONG>CATEGORY</STRONG>, where XMCDLIB is the
  directory specified by the XMcd.libdir resource, and
  CATEGORY is the category name selected when <STRONG>Save</STRONG> is
  performed.  See the description of XMCD_CDDBPATH in the
  ENVIRONMENT section below.

  You may view the list of directories that <EM>xmcd</EM> will search
  for CD database files by pressing the <STRONG>About...</STRONG> button and
  viewing the pop-up information window.

  The file name of each CD database entry is a hexadecimal
  representation of a special "magic" number computed by <EM>xmcd</EM>
  based on the number of tracks, track timings, and other
  available information about this CD.  This method is used
  because there is no reliable unique CD identifier to be
  found on the CD itself (the CD standard allows for a
  readable IPC/barcode but very few CDs actually contain such
  information).

  Since different pressings of the same CD may sometimes
  contain slightly different track timings, the resultant
  magic number computed by <EM>xmcd</EM> on these CDs will be
  different.  Thus, if you load a CD that is not the same one
  that a CD database entry was created with (but is actually
  the same CD title), <EM>xmcd</EM> may not recognize it and display
  the database information automatically when you insert the
  CD.  In this event, you can search the CD database and find
  the appropriate entry, and establish a "link" to it.  To do
  so, press the <STRONG>Link</STRONG> button, and select the appropriate
  category on the popup window.  <EM>Xmcd</EM> will then present
  another pop-up window containing a list of all CD database
  entries in the specified category (that has the same number
  of tracks as the currently inserted disc).  Select the
  appropriate entry and a link will be made in the CD
  database.

  The <STRONG>Link</STRONG> feature alleviates the need to type in CD database
  information again and avoids duplicate CD database entries.

  In very rare occasions it is possible that the magic number
  of a CD conflicts with that of another.  This is a problem
  that will be addressed in a future release of <EM>xmcd</EM>.

  A master <EM>xmcd</EM> CD database of thousands of CD titles is
  available for Internet anonymous FTP.  See the README file
  of your current <EM>xmcd</EM> distribution for details.  You are
  encouraged to contribute to this database by sending CD
  database entries (that you typed in) to the archive.  The
  master CD database is updated periodically with new user-
  contributed entries.  This version of <EM>xmcd</EM> makes CD database
  contribution easier with the <STRONG>Send</STRONG> button on the CD
  database/Track Program Editor pop-up subwindow.  Pressing
  this button causes the CD database entry (associated with
  the currently loaded CD) to be mailed to the <EM>xmcd</EM> CD
  database archive maintainer.  You should use this feature
  only if your computer is configured to send Internet
  electronic mail.

  <EM>Xmcd</EM> now also has the ability to query a remote CD database
  server host for CD database information.  Thus, it is no
  longer necessary to keep a full copy of the CD database
  locally.  If your system is connected to a TCP/IP network
  (such as the Internet) and has access to a server system
  running the CD database <EM>server</EM> program, you can configure
  your xmcd <EM>client</EM> to query the server.  The <STRONG>cddbPath</STRONG>
  parameter or the XMCD_CDDBPATH environment variable is used
  to configure the use of a remote server.  See the
  ENVIRONMENT section below for details.

  While <EM>xmcd</EM> is running, the file <STRONG>/tmp/.cdaudio/curr.</STRONG><EM>nnnn</EM>
  (where nnnn is the hexadecimal representation of the CD-
  ROM's device number) contains the device node path, CD
  database category and disc identifier information pertaining
  to the currently loaded CD.  Other applications may read
  this file to identify the currently loaded disc.


<STRONG>ENVIRONMENT</STRONG>
  Several environment variables are currently recognized by
  <EM>xmcd</EM>, and are described as follows:

  <STRONG>XMCD_LIBDIR</STRONG>
	   This is used to override the XMcd.libdir resource.
	   This parameter is the directory path under which <EM>xmcd</EM>'<STRONG>s</STRONG>
	   configuration files, help files, and CD database files
	   are located.  The default value of XMCD_LIBDIR on most
	   systems is /<EM>usr</EM>/<EM>lib</EM>/<EM>X11</EM>/<EM>xmcd</EM>.

  <STRONG>XMCD_CDDBPATH</STRONG>
	   This is used to override the <STRONG>cddbPath</STRONG> common
	   configuration parameter, which is a list of CD database
	   category directories to be used under <STRONG>XMCDLIB</STRONG>/<EM>cddb</EM>
	   (where XMCDLIB is the directory root specified by the
	   XMcd.libdir resource or the XMCD_LIBDIR environment
	   variable).  Also, remote CD database hosts can be
	   specified.

		   <STRONG>rock;classical;jazz;newage;soundtrack;misc</STRONG>

	   This string will cause <EM>xmcd</EM> to search the following
	   directories for CD database files:

		   <STRONG>XMCDLIB</STRONG>/<EM>cddb</EM>/<EM>rock</EM>
		   <STRONG>XMCDLIB</STRONG>/<EM>cddb</EM>/<EM>classical</EM>
		   <STRONG>XMCDLIB</STRONG>/<EM>cddb</EM>/<EM>jazz</EM>
		   etc.

	   You may also specify absolute path names in the
	   XMCD_CDDBPATH entries.  Example:

		   <STRONG>rock;classical;/home/john/industrial;~john/punk;~/cddb/jazz</STRONG>

	   Finally, you may also specify a remote CD database
	   server hosts which xmcd can use to query CD database
	   information.  The syntax is @<EM>hostname</EM>[:<EM>port</EM>].  The
	   hostname can be a fully qualified host name or an IP
	   number.  Example:

		   <STRONG>country;folk;@abc.fubar.com;@xyz.snafu.com</STRONG>

  <STRONG>HOME</STRONG> This is used to determine your home directory.  If HOME
	   is not defined, then <EM>xmcd</EM> tries to obtain it from the
	   /<EM>etc</EM>/<EM>passwd</EM> file.  The home directory path is used by
	   <EM>xmcd</EM> to locate the .<EM>xmcdcfg</EM> directory.


<STRONG>NOTES</STRONG>
  Not all CD-ROM drives support all features that appear on
  <EM>xmcd</EM>. For example, most SCSI-1 drives do not support a
  software-driven volume control.  On these drives the <EM>xmcd</EM>
  volume control slider may have no effect, or in some cases
  it is made to function as a mute control (i.e., it will snap
  to the full-off or full-on positions only).  Similarly, the
  <STRONG>caddy</STRONG> <STRONG>lock</STRONG>, <STRONG>eject</STRONG> and <STRONG>index</STRONG> <STRONG>search</STRONG> buttons found on <EM>xmcd</EM> may
  not have any effect on drives that do not support the
  appropriate functionality.
