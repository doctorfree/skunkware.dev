Change history:
===============


Ver 2.0 patchlevel 2 released Thu May 09 16:46:17 PDT 1996
----------------------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:

    - Added support for the following SCSI CD-ROM drives:
	Nakamichi MBR-7

OS Support changes:

    - On Linux platforms, the CD device is now opened with
      the O_NONBLOCK flag set.  This is in accordance with
      the new Linux CD audio control standard.

    - The closeOnEject parameter is no longer forced to be
      True when running in the SunOS/Linux or FreeBSD ioctl
      modes.

    - Added support for configuring ATAPI drives on the
      SCO Open Server 5.x platform in config.sh.

    - Changed to use #ifdef __bsdi__ instead of #ifdef bsdi
      for BSDI BSD/OS support code.

Misc changes:

    - Cda was not generating the correct command to the remote
      CD database server.  This is now fixed.

    - Another xmcd fix for internationalization and multi-byte
      character sets.

    - If the xmcd and cda was playing in program mode and the repeat
      mode is turned off in the middle of play, it would continue
      with one more repeat iteration before stopping.  This has been
      corrected.


Ver 2.0 patchlevel 1 released Mon Apr 08 10:00:48 PDT 1996
----------------------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:

    - Fixed the Pioneer DR-U124X configuration to include balance
      control support.

OS Support changes:

    - Fixed a install.sh script failure where the variable $AWK
      wasn't defined.  This problem was only occuring on some
      platforms.

    - On Solaris 2.x systems running vold, the xmcd display would
      erroneously indicate "cd busy" after a disc eject.  This is
      now fixed.

    - Corrected compilation problems on some OpenVMS platforms.

Misc changes:

    - Xmcd was malfunctioning on some systems with long device
      path names due to insufficient path name buffer space.
      This has been corrected.

    - On first startup, xmcd tries to write a file to the
      /tmp/.cdaudio directory before the directory is created.
      This is now fixed.

    - Fix handling of CD database files that contain extended ASCII
      characters.

    - Minor changes for internationalization and multi-byte character
      sets.


Ver 2.0 released Thu Mar 21 20:08:15 PST 1996
---------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:

    - Added support for the following SCSI CD-ROM drives:
	Apple CD-300e
	Chinon CDS-545, CDX-545
	IBM 7201-005, 7201-010
	Media Vision CDR-H93RMV, Reno

    - Added support for the following non-SCSI CD-ROM drives:
	Aztech CDA268-01A
	IBM External-ISA
	Longshine LCS-7260
	Mitsumi FX-400B
	Panasonic CR-522, CR-523, CR-574, CR-581
	Philips CM206

	Sony CDU-76E, CDU-531, CDU-535, CDU-7205N
	Teac CD-55A
	Toshiba XM-5302, XM-5402

    - Corrected the NEC CDR-210P configuration defaults.

    - Added workaround for firmware bugs in some Sun CD-ROM drives
      (Sony OEM CDU-8012) that caused a SCSI bus hang after ejecting
      a CD.  See the README file for details.

    - Added workaround for firmware bugs in some Digital RRD42 drives
      that caused xmcd to play track "110" after the end of certain
      CDs.

    - Fixed a bug which caused the CD table-of-contents to be
      incorrectly read on Sony CDU-6111 CD-ROM drives.

    - Added workaround for a firmware bugs in some Chinon CD-ROM
      drives.  These drives report and accept track numbers in BCD
      (rather than binary as specified in the SCSI-2 specifications).

OS Support changes:

    - Added support for the following OS/system platforms:
	BSDI BSD/OS 2.x or later on x86
	Digital OpenVMS on alpha/VAX
	HP-UX 9.x on m68k
	HP-UX 10.x on PA-RISC
	NetBSD 1.0A or later on x86, sparc and others
	SCO Open Server Release 5.x on x86
	Siemens Nixdorf SINIX SVR4/mips
	Silicon Graphics Irix and Irix64 SVR4 6.x
	Sony NEWS-OS/m68k

    - Non-SCSI CD-ROM drives are now supported on the FreeBSD
      platform via the new FreeBSD ioctl method module.

    - Modified to support a change in the FreeBSD 2.0.5R SCSI
      device driver (it now requires the device to be opened O_RDWR
      rather than O_RDONLY for SCSI pass-through operations).

    - Changed handling of dynamic library search on some systems to
      be more intelligent, and moved the support of creating symlinks
      into install.sh (this was in configure.sh in previous releases).

    - SCSI command timeout values have been increased to 10 seconds
      on all platforms that support such a parameter.  This avoids
      problems with some slow-reacting CD-ROM drives.

    - Fixed cda_d/Imakefile to properly support Digital Ultrix.

    - Worked around a problem with SIGCHLD handling in the HP-UX VUE
      environment.  Previously, xmcd may hang when it spawned child
      processes to perform various tasks under VUE.

    - This distribution now comes with several 32x32 pixmap files
      suitable for use as an xmcd desktop icon.  See the README file
      for details.

Misc changes:

    - Changed all file names to be compatible with the ISO9660
      standard (without the Rockridge extension).  The exceptions
      are listed as follows (these cannot be changed due to existing
      convention):

	    Imakefile (all sub-directories)
	    common_d/patchlevel.h
	    xmcd_d/XKeysymDB
	    misc_d/xmcd.icon

      If you received the xmcd source distribution on a CD-ROM that
      does not implement the Rockridge extension then the above files
      will have their names truncated.  You must rename them back to
      their original names before attempting to compile/install.

      An important user-visible aspect of this change is that the
      former LIBDIR/xmcd/config/configure.sh shell script is now named
      LIBDIR/xmcd/config/config.sh.

    - Changed all *.d subdirectory names to *_d.  This is to make
      xmcd compatible with OpenVMS which does not allow dots in the
      directory name.  Also, the wm2xmcd.d directory is renamed
      dbconv_d.

    - Changes to xmcd widget creation code to fix compatibility
      problems with some ports of Motif 2.0.

    - Source code related to CD database management functions are
      now consolidated into the cddb_d subdirectory; which is built into
      a library and shared by xmcd and cda.  This library now has the
      capability of using a remote CDDB server on a TCP/IP network.
      As a result of the reorganization the following changes are made:

      1. The "dbdir:" common parameter is renamed "cddbPath:" and the
	 XMCD_DBPATH environment variable is changed to XMCD_CDDBPATH.
	 The separator character for each component in these parameters
	 is changed from a colon (:) to a semi-colon (;).  In addition
	 to the absolute and relative path names (for local directories),
	 remote servers can be specified with the @hostname[:port]
	 syntax.  The hostname can be the CD database server name
	 or its IP number.  The port number is optional, and need not be
	 specified if it's the same as the default (which is set in the
	 common.cfg file).  An example of the cddbPath parameter:

            cddbPath: rock;jazz;classical;~/mycddb;@cddbsrv.xyz.com

	 The config.sh script now prompts for remote CD database
	 server names and configures this parameter for you.

      2. The "maxDbdirs:" parameter has been obsoleted.

      3. The "dbFileMode:" parameter is renamed "cddbFileMode:".

      4. The former "cddb" indicator in the main window now has been
	 changed to display one of four possible messages:

	 query		Searching CD databases
	 loc-db		Current CD entry found in local CD database
	 rmt-db		Current CD entry found in remote CD database
	 (blank)	No CD database entry found for current CD,
			or no CD loaded

    - Xmcd now automatically scrolls the track list in the CDDB/Program
      subwindow during playback such that the current playing track
      would be visible in the list window.  The auto-scrolling behavior
      is suppressed when a track is selected in the track list, or when 
      editing track titles.

    - The scrolling position of the CDDB/Program subwindow track list
      is now preserved when the time display format is changed using
      the total/track toggle buttons.  Previously, this caused the
      track list to scroll to the top.

    - Double-clicking (or pressing carriage return) on a track in the
      CDDB/Program subwindow track list is equivalent to creating a
      program with the selected track and pressing play.  This is the
      same as in previous versions, but with this release, the main
      window display no longer shows the "prog" indicator while in this
      mode, nor is the track number shown in the CDDB/Program subwindow
      "Program Sequence" text field.  Also, the program is now
      automatically cleared after the selected track is finished playing.

    - Xmcd now displays an asterisk "*" character after the track title
      in the CDDB/Program subwindow track list, if there is extended
      track information associated with that track.  To view it,
      select the track by clicking on it, then click the Track "Ext Info"
      button to pop up the Track Extended Info window.  The "cda toc"
      output has also been modified to more closely resemble xmcd.

    - When ejecting the CD or exiting xmcd, if the on-screen CD database
      information has changed but not yet saved, xmcd now pops up a
      dialog box that asks whether the information should be saved
      to file.

    - The Options pop-up window now has a Save button that allows
      the user to save the settings.

    - Added two new device-specific parameters "repeatMode" and
      "shuffleMode" that allows the user to specify whether the repeat
      or shuffle modes should be enabled on program startup.

    - Xmcd now maintains the file /tmp/.cdaudio/curr.XXXX which contains
      information about the currently loaded CD.  Namely, the device
      path name, the CD database category and the disc ID is recorded
      in this file.  Other applications may read this file to identify
      the CD that is loaded in the drive.  This feature is disabled on
      the Digital OpenVMS platform.

    - Fixed an obscure xmcd crash that may occur when the time display
      is in r-disc mode; while a program is cleared but still playing,
      and an attempt is made to change tracks.

    - After a CDDB link operation, the xmcd main window now displays the
      track title correctly while the CD is playing.  Previously,
      "unknown track title" is shown until a track change occurred.

    - When running in shuffle mode or if a track program is in effect,
      moving the track warp slider all the way to the right produced
      incorrect behavior on some platforms.  Also, if the CD is not playing
      and the track warp slider is moved by clicking to the left or right
      of the thumb (not dragging), the keypad time display is not correctly
      updated.  These problems are now fixed.

    - The cda utility did not handle the playOnLoad and ejectOnDone
      parameters correctly.  Fixed.

    - Reorganized the code in cda to reduce the size of the cda_visual()
      routine.

    - Multiple cda "client" programs can now simultaneously run with
      a single cda daemon (the same CD-ROM drive).

    - The cda utility now correctly handles old FIFO files from a
      previously-killed cda daemon.  Also, implemented new locking
      scheme to ensure that no more than a single cda daemon process
      can be invoked per CD-ROM drive.

    - Added a "cda debug" command that allows the user to query, set
      or unset the debug mode on-the-fly.

    - The install.sh script displays the wrong default LIBDIR
      on XFree86-3.x systems.  Fixed.

    - Display formatting improvements to the config.sh script.

    - Other enhancements and cleanups.


Ver 1.4 patchlevel 2 released Mon Mar 27 08:19:58 PST 1995
----------------------------------------------------------
CD-ROM Support changes:

    - Corrected a problem with the Sony CDU-55E ATAPI CD-ROM
      drive support on the Linux platform.


Ver 1.4 patchlevel 1 released Thu Feb 16 08:14:02 PST 1995
----------------------------------------------------------
OS Support changes:

    - Corrected a minor problem with the FreeBSD platform support.


Ver 1.4 released Sun Feb 12 20:54:01 PST 1995
---------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:

    - Added support for the Chinon CDx-525, Digital RRD44, NEC CDR-210P,
      Plextor PX-43CS/PX-45CS, Sony CDU-55S and Toshiba XM-3501
      SCSI CD-ROM drives.

    - On the Linux platforms only, added support for the Mitsumi
      FX001, LU005S, NEC CDR-260, CDR-260R, Panasonic/Matsushita/Kotobuki
      CR-521, CR-562, CR-563, and Sony CDU-31A, CDU-33A and CDU-55E
      CD-ROM drives.  These are non-SCSI drives using a proprietary
      interface card, sound card or an IDE/EIDE/ATAPI interface.
      Xmcd/cda must be configured to run using the SunOS/Linux ioctl
      method to use these (rather than SCSI pass-through).  Also,
      the appropriate driver support must be configured in the kernel.

    - On SCSI-2 drives, the IMMED bit in the Start Stop Unit
      SCSI command CDB is now set.  This causes the CD ejects
      command to complete immediately, avoiding command time-out
      situations on some platforms.

    - When ejectOnExit was set, the CD wasn't being ejected when the
      program quits (on certain SCSI-1 CD-ROM drives only).  This is
      now fixed.

    - The version number of the LIBDIR/xmcd/config/.cfgtbl/* files
      have been bumped to 2.  A new field is added to these files
      to configure the new noTURWhenPlaying parameter in device.cfg.

OS Support changes:

    - Add support for the FreeBSD (version 2.0.5 or later) platform.
      See the README file for special notes about the kernel and
      SCSI driver configuration.

    - The configure.sh script was not properly setting the MAILCMD
      variable on some OS platforms.  Fixed.

    - Added a SunOS/Linux ioctl method module to libdi.  This is
      primarily used to support non-SCSI CD-ROM drives using a
      proprietary interface card under Linux.  Although this method
      can be used with SCSI CD-ROM drives under Linux, SunOS 4.1.x,
      and Solaris 2.x platforms, it is recommended that the SCSI
      pass-through method be used instead.

    - Fixed a problem with the volume slider not being properly
      initialized on the Digital OSF/1 and Motorola SVR4/m88k platforms.

    - The configure.sh script no longer rejects a device node path
      that doesn't exist on the Solaris 2.x platform with the
      Solaris Volume Manager.

Misc changes:

    - Enhanced the libdi design such that multiple CD-ROM controlling
      methods can be implemented and coexist.  The original support for
      SCSI pass-through is now an instance of a method.  This change
      involves adding another jump table for all libdi functions
      to branch control to the appropriate method.  The device.cfg
      file now has a new deviceInterfaceMethod parameter that
      configures the actual method to use.  See the PORTING file
      for details.

    - The cda utility now supports a "visual" mode that turns cda
      into a screen-oriented (curses-based) CD player.

    - Implemented work-around to avoid hitting a bug in some versions
      of Motif-1.2.  The symptom was a xmcd crash when the
      CDDB/Program subwindow is closed.

    - The xmcd CDDB/Program window Track List now highlights
      the appropriate entry when a track title is being edited in
      the Track Title Editor box, even if a track is not explicitly
      selected.  Also, the Track List now automatically scrolls down
      as tracks titles are entered.

    - Xmcd now displays an error message if a CDDB Save operation
      fails due to a full filesystem.

    - The dbdir parameter in common.cfg and the XMCD_DBPATH environment
      variables now support tilde-expansion (e.g., ~/somepath or
      ~someuser/somepath are now handled correctly).

    - Xmcd and cda now creates a directory /tmp/.cdaudio.  All
      lock files, fifo nodes, and other temporary files are created
      and deleted under that directory (instead of directly in /tmp).
      This is because many platforms set the sticky bit in the
      /tmp directory permissions, making it cumbersome for xmcd/cda to
      maintain lock files (one user's xmcd process should be able to
      delete another's lock file if the other process has exited).

    - The misc.d/makesrc.sh and misc.d/makerel.sh scripts have been
      further enhanced to print informative messages, and these now
      work correctly on systems with a limited command line length.

    - Removed the BUGS file and added the FAQ file.

    - Added the "reggae" and "folk" categories to the standard CD
      database.

    - Other enhancements and cleanups.


Ver 1.3 released Fri Sep 30 12:32:10 PDT 1994
---------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:

    - Added support for the Digital RRD43 CD-ROM drive.

OS Support changes:

    - IBM AIX 4.x is now supported.

    - Fixed a misplaced line in libdi.d/configure.sh that caused
      the default device node path to be set wrong under the IBM AIX
      and Digital OSF/1 environments.

    - Added improved instructions for DG/UX, and corrected the default
      CD-ROM device node path in configure.sh.

    - The configure.sh script now will set up the XMcd*cddbMailCmd
      parameter as well, based on the OS variant.

    - The configure.sh now prompts the user before creating any
      X library symbolic links from non-standard locations to /usr/lib
      on SVR4 systems.

Misc changes:
    - Added an xmcd Options sub-window which allows run-time toggle
      of many of the feature options in the device.cfg file.  The
      Options window also includes a Channel Routing selector, a
      Volume Control Taper selector and a stereo Balance slider
      control (these can be used on CD-ROM drives that has the
      appropriate capabilities).

    - Added a Track Warp feature in the xmcd Keypad subwindow.  This
      allows fast searches to any part of a track using a slider.
      In conjunction with the keypad, this allows very easy access
      to any arbitrary CD location.  A similar feature is added to
      cda, where the "cda play" command now accepts an optional
      mm:ss offset argument if a track number is also specified.

    - Added a new Repeat Count Indicator in the xmcd main window
      display area.  This shows the number of iteration completed
      when playing audio with the Repeat mode enabled.  Likewise,
      a Repeat Count field is added to the "cda status" output.

    - Added support for the following cda commands: "balance"
      to set the stereo channel balance, and "route" to set the
      channel routing.

    - The Disc ID indicator in the xmcd CDDB/Program window now
      displays the CD category as well as the disc ID number.
      Likewise, the "cda toc" command now displays the category
      under the "Disc ID" heading as well.

    - The xmcd database Link feature CD list now displays the
      average track offset difference between the current CD and
      each potential database match.  Those entries that are
      within 10 seconds are now listed with bold font.  This
      enhancement is based on code contributed by Andreas Zins
      (zins@forwiss.uni-erlangen.de).

    - Fixed a bug which causes xmcd to generate an X protocol error
      if the XMcd*cddbMailCmd resource is improperly set and the
      Send button is used.

    - The XMcd*cddbMailCmd resource now uses %S, %A and %F to denote
      the mail subject, mail address and CD database file path,
      respectively.  This makes it easier to configure xmcd to work
      with different mailers.

    - Fixed a bug where the track list display in the CDDB subwindow
      was being duplicated when a disc which is not in the database
      is inserted and ejected.

    - Fixed a typo in the xmcd.d/cfgtbl/Pioneer file which caused
      Pioneer not to appear in the xmcd configure.sh menu.

    - Increased the string buffer used in common_parminit() in
      xmcd.d/cdfunc.c so that longer CD database directory paths
      can be accommodated.

    - The "caddyLock" parameter is now in device.cfg instead of
      common.cfg.  Thus, it is now configurable on a per-device
      basis.
    - Added the balanceControlSupport, channelRouteSupport and
      channelRoute parameters to device.cfg.  Enhanced the configure.sh
      script to set up these parameters based on CD-ROM drive brand
      and model.

    - Fixed libdi.d/configure.sh to not put a backslash in the
      app-defaults/XMcd file (it was writing "XMcd\*libdir:", but
      it should be "XMcd*libdir:").

    - Added support for editres(1) in xmcd.  The code is enabled if
      compiled with -DEDITRES in the xmcd.d directory under X11R5 or
      later.  This feature is contributed by Andreas Zins
      (zins@forwiss.uni-erlangen.de).

    - The "cda status cont" command now supports a sub-argument
      "secs" to allow the user to specify the display update time
      interval in seconds.  The default is now 1 second.

    - The "cda extinfo" command now always displays the disc extended
      info, then followed by the track extended info of the currently
      playing track, if any.  If "cda extinfo track#" is specified,
      then the specified track extended info is displayed instead.

    - The xmcd/cda -debug option was ineffective if the user has a
      $HOME/.xmcdcfg/common.cfg file with the debugMode parameter
      set to False.  This is now fixed.

    - Added "blues" and "country" to the default CD categories list.

    - If using the GNU C compiler (gcc), it is no longer required
      to specify the -fwritable-strings option.

    - Other enhancements and cleanups.


Ver 1.2 released Wed Jul 27 12:34:29 PDT 1994
---------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:

    - Fixed to really work with the Chinon CD-43x drives.

    - Add support for the Plextor 4Plex and the NEC CDR-900 (4xPro).

OS Support changes:

    - Add support for Apple A/UX, Data General DG/UX and Stratus
      FTX SVR4/PA-RISC platforms.

    - Enhancements to the Digital OSF/1 and Ultrix error handling.

    - On Solaris 2.x platforms, added support for the -c, -X and
      -o options for full compatibility with the Solaris Volume
      Manager auto-start feature using the action_workman.so
      program.

Misc changes:

    - Major source code tree re-organization into subdirectories.

    - "Makefile.std" files are added to the source code distribution.
      These can be used to build the source code on systems that do
      not have imake.

    - Added a new utility "cda" to the distribution.  This is a
      command-line driven (non-X) audio CD player.  The command
      interface makes it ideal as a script-driven player.

    - A new "Send" button is added to the xmcd CDDB/Program window.
      This allows users to send the CD database entry of the currently
      loaded CD to the xmcd CD database archive site.

    - The "Play Program" button in the CDDB/Program window has been
      deleted.  The main window "Play/Pause" button is used to
      start program playback instead.  This change also involves a
      few other minor program-mode related behavioral changes.

    - Many common configuration parameters have been moved from
      XMcd.ad into the new common.cfg file.

    - The device-specific configuration file has been renamed from
      dev.config to device.cfg.

    - Added two new device-specific parameters that can be set to
      suit user preferences: "playOnLoad" determines whether xmcd
      will auto-play a CD after loading, and "ejectOnDone" determines
      whether xmcd will automatically eject the CD after it's done
      playing.

    - The CD now does not spin down between tracks when using the
      prev-track or next-track buttons in shuffle and program modes.

    - Xmcd (and cda) no longer silently ignore the error if the
      common or device-specific configuration file cannot be opened.

    - Fixed a few obscure problems involving the use of various
      xmcd controls when the player is in shuffle or program mode
      and the playback is paused.

    - If a CD has multiple links in the database, xmcd no longer
      displays duplicate lines in the Link Selector list menu.
      Also, the list menu sorting is now case-insensitive.

    - All window sizes have been reduced to conserve screen space.

    - The XMcd*mainShowTrackTitle, XMcd*mainShowDiscTitle and
      XMcd*cddbTimeShowLength X resources have been removed.  The
      built-in behavior is equivalent to setting these to True.

    - The install.sh and configure.sh scripts now have error message
      logging capability.

    - A new makeshar.sh script is added to the distribution that
      makes shar format xmcd source code releases.

    - Security improvements: the uid and gid settings are forced to
      their original settings regardless of whether SETUID_ROOT is
      defined.

    - Other enhancements and cleanups.


Ver 1.1 released Fri Feb 25 18:40:36 PST 1994
---------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:

    - Add support for more SCSI-2 CD-ROM drives from Chinon, Hitachi,
      NEC, Pioneer, Procom, Sony and Toshiba.

    - Added support for Apple, Chinon and Sony SCSI-1 CD-ROM drives
      operating using vendor-unique commands.

    - Fixed problems in the Pioneer vendor-unique support code.

    - Drive-specific configuration data (previously hard coded in
      configure.sh) is now looked up in table files under the
      LIBDIR/xmcd/config/.tbl directory.

    - On SCSI-2 drives, the REW, FF and Sample operations will now use
      Play Audio MSF command by default, if the playAudioMSFSupport
      parameter is True.  In xmcd-1.0, these operations were supported
      only with the Play Audio(10) or Play Audio (12) commands.

    - A new curposFormat device-specific parameter is added to
      specify whether the CD-ROM drive supports Data Format 1 (CD-ROM
      Current Position) of the Read Subchannel SCSI-2 command.

    - The volumeControlSetDBD device-specific parameter is renamed to
      modeSenseSetDBD.

OS Support changes:

    - Added support for Digital Ultrix and OSF/1 on DECstations and
      Digital Alpha AXP.

    - Added support for Linux on Intel x86 platforms.

    - Added support for IBM AIX on the RS/6000.

    - Added support for SGI IRIX on SGI workstations.

    - HP-UX specific code is now conditionally compiled via
      #ifdef __hpux instead of #ifdef hpux.  This is because the HP cc
      compiler pre-defines the former but not the latter in ANSI mode
      (-Ae).

    - Changed a "struct inquiry_data" to "struct inqry_data" in
      di_scsipt.h to avoid conflict with "union inquiry_data" in HP-UX's
      <sys/scsi.h>.

    - Support for Solaris 2.x platforms is improved.  Added code to
      coexist with the Solaris Volume Manager.

    - The configure.sh script has been improved such that on SVR4
      systems, it will attempt to create symlinks of shared library
      files to /usr/lib even if LIBDIR is set to a non-standard
      location.

    - Fixed to avoid a core dump in cd_untimeout() on some 64-bit
      systems.

Misc changes:
    - Source file names were changed to better illustrate their function.

    - Reordered a few stack structure declarations to fix alignment
      issues on some platforms.  This fixes a core dump and other
      failures when doing FF and REW operations on those systems.

    - Improved CD database files permissions handling.

    - Added a -debug command line option.  When used, xmcd will generate
      verbose diagnostics about the commands it sends and the data it
      receives from the CD-ROM drive.

    - Added XMcd.mainShowDiscTitle and XMcd.mainShowTrackTitle X
      application resources.  When set to True, these will cause xmcd
      to display the artist/disc title and currently playing track title
      in the main window display area, respectively.  The default
      settings for these are True.  For those who prefer the simpler
      appearance of xmcd-1.0, you can set either or both of these
      resources to False.

    - Added XMcd.cddbTimeShowLength X application resource.  When set
      to True, the default CDDB Track List time display mode will be
      "track lengths" instead of "track offsets".

    - A new exitOnEject device-specific parameter is added which, if
      set to True, causes xmcd to exit when a CD is ejected.  Likewise,
      the new closeOnEject parameter causes xmcd to close the device on
      eject, and re-open when the CD is re-loaded.

    - The CD database disc ID is now shown on the CDDB window.

    - A watch cursor is now displayed when xmcd is doing CD database
      file I/O.

    - A wm2xmcd utility is now included in the xmcd distribution that
      converts WorkMan CD database files to xmcd format.

    - Other enhancements and cleanups.
