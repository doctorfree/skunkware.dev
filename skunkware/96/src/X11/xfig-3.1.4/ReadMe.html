<STRONG>NAME</STRONG>
  xfig - Facility for Interactive Generation of figures under
  X11

<STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>
  <STRONG>xfig</STRONG> [<EM>options</EM>] [<EM>file</EM>]

<STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
  <EM>Xfig</EM> is a menu-driven tool that allows the user to draw and
  manipulate objects interactively under the X Window System.
  <STRONG>It</STRONG> <STRONG>runs</STRONG> <STRONG>under</STRONG> <STRONG>X</STRONG> <STRONG>version</STRONG> <STRONG>11</STRONG> <STRONG>release</STRONG> <STRONG>4</STRONG> <STRONG>or</STRONG> <STRONG>higher</STRONG> and requires
  a two- or three-button mouse.  <EM>file</EM> specifies the name of a
  file to be edited.  The description of objects in the file
  will be read at the start of <EM>xfig</EM>.

  When using a two-button mouse use the &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt; key and the
  right button at the same time to effect the action of the
  middle button.

  <EM>Xfig</EM> is available via anonymous ftp from <EM>ftp.x</EM>.<EM>org</EM> in
  <STRONG>/contrib/applications/drawing_tools/xfig</STRONG>.

  The <EM>TransFig</EM> package is used when printing or exporting the
  output from <EM>xfig</EM>.  It is automatically called by <EM>xfig</EM> as a
  back-end processor to produce various types of output:

  LaTeX         <EM>fig2dev</EM> -<STRONG>L</STRONG> <EM>latex</EM> translates <EM>xfig</EM> to <EM>LaTeX</EM>
				picture environment commands which can be
				processed along with other <EM>LaTeX</EM> commands.

  Metafont      <EM>fig2dev</EM> -<STRONG>L</STRONG> <EM>mf</EM> produces <EM>Metafont</EM> output.

  PostScript    <EM>fig2dev</EM> -<STRONG>L</STRONG> <EM>ps</EM> produces an <EM>Encapsulated</EM>
				<EM>PostScript</EM> output.

  IBM-GL        <EM>fig2dev</EM> -<STRONG>L</STRONG> <EM>ibmgl</EM> produces a <EM>IBM</EM>-<EM>GL</EM> (<EM>HP</EM>/<EM>GL)</EM>
				output.

  Pic           <EM>fig2dev</EM> -<STRONG>L</STRONG> <EM>pic</EM> produces a <EM>pic</EM> output.

  PiCTeX        <EM>fig2dev</EM> -<STRONG>L</STRONG> <EM>pictex</EM> produces <EM>PiCTeX</EM> output.
				This contains macros that can be used with the
				<EM>PiCTeX</EM> environment under <EM>TeX</EM> or <EM>LaTeX</EM>.

  Others        <EM>fig2dev</EM> has options for these other languages:
				<EM>box</EM>, <EM>epic</EM>, <EM>eepic</EM>, and <EM>eepicemu</EM>.

  The <EM>TransFig</EM> package is available via anonymous ftp from
  <EM>ftp.x</EM>.<EM>org</EM> in <STRONG>/contrib/applications/drawing_tools/transfig</STRONG>.

<STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
  <STRONG>-help</STRONG>
	   Print all command-line options for xfig and quit.

  <STRONG>-L</STRONG>[<STRONG>andscape</STRONG>]
	   Make <EM>xfig</EM> come up in landscape mode (10.5" x 8").  This
	   is the default; however as the orientation is stored
	   with Fig files, when you load a Fig file the
	   orientation will change as required.  This is only true
	   for files of version 3.0 or higher.

  <STRONG>-P</STRONG>[<STRONG>ortrait</STRONG>]
	   Make <EM>xfig</EM> come up in portrait mode (8.5" x 9").  See
	   note about landscape mode.

  <STRONG>-bg</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
	   Use <EM>color</EM> as the background color for the canvas and
	   buttons.

  <STRONG>-bol</STRONG>[<STRONG>d</STRONG>] <EM>font</EM>
	   Cause the font used for displaying the file name and
	   confirmation messages to be <EM>font</EM> (default = 8x13bold).

  <STRONG>-butt</STRONG>[<STRONG>on</STRONG>] <EM>font</EM>
	   Cause the font used for most buttons to be <EM>font</EM>
	   (default = 6x13).

  <STRONG>-but_</STRONG>[<STRONG>per_row</STRONG>] <EM>number</EM>
	   Specify the number of buttons wide the mode panel
	   should be.  This is useful in conjunction with the
	   <STRONG>-pheight</STRONG> parameter to reduce the canvas height for
	   small screens.

  <STRONG>-de</STRONG>[<STRONG>bug</STRONG>]
	   Turn on debugging mode.  Prints various debugging
	   messages like font names etc.

  <STRONG>-do</STRONG>[<STRONG>ntswitchcmap</STRONG>]
	   Prevents xfig from switching to a private colormap if
	   there aren't enough colors available in the default
	   colormap.  See also <STRONG>-max_image_colors.</STRONG>

  <STRONG>-e</STRONG>[<STRONG>xportLanguage</STRONG>] <EM>language</EM>
	   Specifies the language to be used for when exporting a
	   fig file.  Choices are:









	   Name        Language
	   -------------------------------------------
	   box         LaTeX box (figure boundary)
	   latex       LaTeX picture
	   epic        LaTeX picture + epic macros
	   eepic       LaTeX picture + eepic macros
	   eepicemu    LaTeX picture + eepicemu macros
	   pictex      PiCTeX macros
	   ibmgl       IBMGL (or HPGL)
	   eps         Encapuslated PostScript
	   ps          PostScript
	   pstex       Combined PS/LaTeX (PS part)
	   pstex_t     Combined PS/LaTeX (LaTeX part)
	   textyl      Textyl special commands
	   tpic        TPIC
	   pic         PIC
	   mf          MF (MetaFont)
	   gif         GIF
	   jpg         JPEG (JFIF)
	   xbm         X11 Bitmap
	   xpm         X11 Pixmap (XPM3 package)
	   -------------------------------------------

  <STRONG>-fg</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
	   Use <EM>color</EM> as the foreground color and default color for
	   objects.

  <STRONG>-fl</STRONG>[<STRONG>ushleft</STRONG>]
	   Set the print option to print the figure flush left.
	   The default is to center the figure on the page.

  <STRONG>-geom</STRONG>[<STRONG>etry</STRONG>] <STRONG>W</STRONG>x<STRONG>H</STRONG>+<STRONG>X</STRONG>+<STRONG>Y</STRONG>
	   Specifies the geometry for Fig application.

  <STRONG>-iconG</STRONG>[<STRONG>eometry</STRONG>] +<STRONG>X</STRONG>+<STRONG>Y</STRONG>
	   Specifies the position for the icon.

  <STRONG>-inc</STRONG>[<STRONG>hes</STRONG>]
	   Make inches the unit of choice (default).

  <STRONG>-ma</STRONG>[<STRONG>ximagecolors</STRONG>] <EM>numcols</EM>
	   Limit the number of colors used for EPS, GIF, JPEG or
	   XPM images to <EM>numcols</EM>.

  <STRONG>-me</STRONG>[<STRONG>tric</STRONG>]
	   Make centimeters the unit of choice.

	   After <EM>xfig</EM> is started you may change the units from
	   metric to imperial or vice versa from a popup menu
	   available by pressing mouse button 3 in the <EM>units</EM> box
	   where the two rulers meet.

  <STRONG>-internalBW</STRONG> <EM>width</EM>
	   Use lines of width <EM>width</EM> between all buttons and panels
	   (default = 1).

  <STRONG>-inv</STRONG>[<STRONG>erse</STRONG>]
	   Use inverse video (white on black).

  <STRONG>-k</STRONG>[<STRONG>eyFile</STRONG>] <EM>compose</EM>-<EM>key</EM>-<EM>file</EM>
	   Use <EM>compose</EM>-<EM>key</EM>-<EM>file</EM> instead of <EM>CompKeyDB</EM> for compose
	   (meta) key database.  If there are no ``<STRONG>/</STRONG>''s in the
	   name, the file must reside in the <EM>xfig</EM> library
	   directory, $<EM>XFIGLIBDIR</EM>, usually
	   <STRONG>/usr/local/lib/X11/xfig</STRONG>.  If there are any ``<STRONG>/</STRONG>''s in
	   the name it is taken as is (not relative to
	   $<EM>XFIGLIBDIR)</EM>.  If there is a leading ``<STRONG>~/</STRONG>'' in the
	   string then the ``<STRONG>~</STRONG>'' is expanded to the user's home
	   directory.

  <STRONG>-lat</STRONG>[<STRONG>exfonts</STRONG>]
	   Start <EM>xfig</EM> with <EM>LaTeX</EM> font selection.  Normally, the
	   <EM>PostScript</EM> fonts are available as the default.  This
	   flag selects the <EM>LaTeX</EM> fonts to start.

  <STRONG>-le</STRONG>[<STRONG>ft</STRONG>]
	   Change the position of the side panel window to the
	   left of the canvas window.  This is the default.

  <STRONG>-mo</STRONG>[<STRONG>nochrome</STRONG>]
	   Use black and white only.

  <STRONG>-nor</STRONG>[<STRONG>mal</STRONG>] <EM>font</EM>
	   Cause the font used for the message window to be <EM>font</EM>.
	   This font is also used on the canvas when the selected
	   font is not available in an X11 font (default = 6x13).

  <STRONG>-not</STRONG>[<STRONG>rack</STRONG>]
	   Turn off cursor (mouse) tracking arrows.

  <STRONG>-ph</STRONG>[<STRONG>eight</STRONG>] <EM>height</EM>
	   Make the <EM>xfig</EM> canvas <EM>height</EM> high (where <EM>height</EM> is
	   either cm or in, depending on the -metric setting).

  <STRONG>-pw</STRONG>[<STRONG>idth</STRONG>] <EM>width</EM>
	   Make the <EM>xfig</EM> canvas <EM>width</EM> wide (where <EM>width</EM> is either
	   cm or in, depending on the -metric setting).

  <STRONG>-ri</STRONG>[<STRONG>ght</STRONG>]
	   Change the position of the side panel window to the
	   right of the canvas window (default: left).

  <STRONG>-sc</STRONG>[<STRONG>alablefonts</STRONG>]
	   Allows use of the X11R5 or OpenWindows scalable fonts
	   (this is the default).  If the scalable fonts aren't
	   available <EM>xfig</EM> will automatically switch to non-scaling
	   fonts.

  <STRONG>-nosc</STRONG>[<STRONG>alablefonts</STRONG>]
	   Disables use of the X11R5 or OpenWindows scalable
	   fonts.  You might want to use this for debugging.

  <STRONG>-sh</STRONG>[<STRONG>owallbuttons</STRONG>]
	   Show all the <EM>xfig</EM> indicator buttons instead of only
	   those relevant to the current drawing mode.  Normally,
	   the buttons <EM>line</EM> <EM>width</EM>, <EM>area</EM>-<EM>fill</EM>, <EM>grid</EM> <EM>mode</EM>, <EM>text</EM>
	   <EM>size</EM>, etc. are only visible when they are relevant to
	   the current drawing mode.  The <STRONG>-showallbuttons</STRONG> option
	   makes all of the indicator buttons visible at all
	   times.  This takes up more screen real estate, but
	   allows the user to see all settable parameters.

  <STRONG>-sp</STRONG>[<STRONG>ecialtext</STRONG>]
	   Start <EM>xfig</EM> with the <EM>special</EM> <EM>text</EM> mode for text objects.

  <STRONG>-startfi</STRONG>[<STRONG>llstyle</STRONG>] <EM>stylenumber</EM>
	   Set the starting fill style for area fill (-1 to 21).

  <STRONG>-startfo</STRONG>[<STRONG>ntsize</STRONG>] <EM>pointsize</EM>
	   Set the default font size for text objects (default =
	   12pt).

  <STRONG>-startg</STRONG>[<STRONG>ridmode</STRONG>] <EM>modenumber</EM>
	   Set the starting grid mode (0 to 3).  Mode 0 is no
	   grid.  In imperial (inches) mode, grid mode 1 is 1/4
	   inch, mode 2 is 1/2 inch and mode 3 is 1 inch.  In
	   metric mode, grid mode 1 is 5mm, mode 2 is 1cm and mode
	   3 is 2cm.

  <STRONG>-startla</STRONG>[<STRONG>texFont</STRONG>] <EM>font</EM>
	   Set the starting font name for <EM>LaTeX</EM> fonts.

  <STRONG>-startt</STRONG>[<STRONG>extstep</STRONG>] <EM>stepsize</EM>
	   Set the starting text step.

  <STRONG>-startli</STRONG>[<STRONG>newidth</STRONG>] <EM>width</EM>
	   Set the starting line width.

  <STRONG>-startp</STRONG>[<STRONG>sFont</STRONG>] <EM>font</EM>
	   Set the starting font name for <EM>PostScript</EM> fonts.

  <STRONG>-ta</STRONG>[<STRONG>blet</STRONG>]
	   Specifies that xfig should use the input tablet instead
	   of the mouse for drawing.  You must have the
	   XInputExtension in your X server and an input tablet
	   for this to work.  Also, you must modify the Imakefile
	   to include the USETAB and TABLIB variables.

  <STRONG>-tr</STRONG>[<STRONG>ack</STRONG>]
	   Turn on cursor (mouse) tracking arrows (default).

  <STRONG>-users</STRONG>[<STRONG>cale</STRONG>] <EM>scale</EM>
	   Set the multiplier for displayed line lengths etc.
	   This factor is multiplied by the actual length, radius
	   or diameter of the object currently being drawn on the
	   canvas.  It is useful for making scale drawings, where
	   e.g. 1 inch = 1 foot (userscale = 12.0) or 1cm = 1m
	   (userscale = 100.0).

  <STRONG>-useru</STRONG>[<STRONG>nit</STRONG>] <EM>units</EM>
	   The <EM>units</EM> string is printed with the length information
	   when drawing objects.  For example if the <EM>userscale</EM> =
	   1.0 and the <EM>userunit</EM> = <EM>ft</EM> then a line which is 3 inches
	   long on the canvas would be displayed as ``length = 3
	   ft'' when it is being drawn.

	   After <EM>xfig</EM> is started you may change the <EM>userscale</EM> and
	   the <EM>userunit</EM> from a popup menu available by pressing
	   mouse button 3 in the <EM>units</EM> box where the two rulers
	   meet.

<STRONG>GRAPHICAL</STRONG> <STRONG>OBJECTS</STRONG>
  The objects in <EM>xfig</EM> are divided into <STRONG>primitive</STRONG> <STRONG>objects</STRONG> and
  <STRONG>compound</STRONG> <STRONG>objects</STRONG>.  The primitive objects are: <EM>ARC</EM>, <EM>CIRCLE</EM>,
  <EM>CLOSED</EM> <EM>SPLINE</EM>, <EM>ELLIPSE</EM>, <EM>POLYLINE</EM>, <EM>POLYGON</EM>, <EM>PICTURE</EM>, <EM>BOX</EM>,
  <EM>ARC</EM>-<EM>BOX</EM>, <EM>SPLINE</EM>, and <EM>TEXT</EM>.

  A primitive object can be moved, rotated, flipped vertically
  or horizontally, scaled, copied, aligned within a compound
  object or erased.  The <EM>TEXT</EM> primitive may not be flipped.
  The attributes of any primitive object can be edited using a
  popup panel (discussed below), so you can, for instance, set
  the position of an object manually.

  A compound object is composed of primitive objects.  The
  primitive objects that constitute a compound can not be
  individually modified, but they can be manipulated as an
  entity; a compound can be moved, rotated, flipped vertically
  or horizontally, scaled, copied or erased.  A compound that
  contains any boxes or arc-boxes may only be rotated by 90
  degrees.

  Objects may overlap other objects according to their
  ``depth''.  Objects with larger depth number are obscured by
  objects with smaller depth.

  <EM>Regular</EM> polygons may be created using a special drawing
  mode, but a general <EM>POLYGON</EM> is created as a result, which
  may then be modified, i.e.  the individual vertices may be
  moved if desired.

<STRONG>DISPLAY</STRONG> <STRONG>WINDOWS</STRONG>
  Ten regions comprise the display area of <EM>xfig</EM>: the command
  region, top ruler, side ruler, drawing mode region, editing
  mode region, filename region, message region, mouse function
  indicator region and canvas region, and indicator region
  with buttons to set and show current line thickness, line
  style, color, area-fill gray color and several other
  settings.  (The mouse function indicator region was inspired
  by the UPS debugger from the University of Kent.) The
  drawing and editing mode regions may be placed (together) to
  the left or right of the the canvas window (default: left).

<STRONG>COMMAND</STRONG> <STRONG>PANEL</STRONG> <STRONG>FUNCTIONS</STRONG>
  <EM>Quit</EM> Exit from <EM>xfig</EM>, discarding the figure.  If the figure
	   has been modified and not saved, the user will be asked
	   to confirm the action, by clicking mouse button 1 on a
	   confirm/cancel popup menu.  The accelerator &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>q</STRONG>
	   will also perform this function.  This and all other
	   accelerators are defined in the <EM>app</EM>-<EM>defaults</EM> file and
	   may be changed if desired.

  <EM>Port</EM>/<EM>Land</EM>
	   Change shape of xfig canvas from/to portrait/landscape.
	   Note:  the canvas will automatically change to the
	   portrait/landscape configuration specified in Fig files
	   of version 3.0 or higher when loading those files.

  <EM>Delete</EM> <EM>ALL</EM>
	   Delete all objects from the canvas window (may be
	   undone).  The accelerator &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>d</STRONG> will also perform
	   this function.

  <EM>Undo</EM> Undo the last object creation, deletion or
	   modification.  The accelerator &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>u</STRONG> will also
	   perform this function.  If an undo of a <EM>Paste</EM> or file
	   <EM>Merge</EM> is done, any user-defined colors in the figure
	   pasted in or the file just merged will NOT be
	   undefined.

  <EM>Redraw</EM>
	   Redraw the canvas.  There are also two accelerators
	   which do a redraw - &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>r</STRONG> and &lt;<EM>Ctrl</EM>&gt;<STRONG>l</STRONG>.

  <EM>Paste</EM>
	   Paste the object previously copied into the cut/paste
	   file into the current figure (at its original
	   position).  The accelerator &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>t</STRONG> will also perform
	   this function.

  <EM>File</EM> Pressing mouse button 3 on this button invokes <EM>Save</EM>
	   function without popping up the file panel.  Before the
	   figure is saved the original file is first renamed with
	   the suffix ``.bak'' appended.  This provides a backup
	   file.

	   Mouse button 1 or &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>f</STRONG> pops up a panel which
	   contains several file-related functions:

	   <EM>Current</EM> <EM>Filename</EM>
			This is read-only AsciiTextWidget which contains
			the filename that will be used to write output to
			a file <EM>if</EM> <EM>there</EM> <EM>is</EM> <EM>no</EM> <EM>name</EM> <EM>specified</EM> <EM>in</EM> the
			<EM>Filename</EM> panel.

	   <EM>Filename</EM>
			This is an editable AsciiTextWidget which contains
			the filename selected either by clicking on a
			filename from the <EM>Alternatives</EM> list or by typing a
			name in directly.  Pressing return in the Filename
			window will <EM>Load</EM> the file and copy the name to the
			<EM>Current</EM> <EM>Filename</EM> widget.

	   (<EM>File)</EM> <EM>Alternatives</EM>
			Pressing mouse button 1 on a filename in the file
			alternatives window will select that file by
			copying the filename into <EM>Filename</EM> window.
			Pressing return in this window will <EM>Load</EM> the file
			specified in the <EM>Filename</EM> window (if any) or the
			<EM>Current</EM> <EM>Filename</EM> widget.

	   <EM>Filename</EM> <EM>Mask</EM>
			A wildcard mask may be typed into this editable
			AsciiTextWidget to restrict the search of
			filenames to a subset ala the <EM>ls</EM> command.
			Pressing return in this window will automatically
			rescan the current directory.  This string may be
			set by setting the X toolkit resource
			<STRONG>Fig*file_panel*mask*string</STRONG>.

	   <EM>Current</EM> <EM>Directory</EM>
			This is an editable AsciiTextWidget which shows
			the current directory.  It may be modified by the
			user to manually set a directory name.  When
			return is pressed in this window the directory
			specified is scanned for files matching the
			<EM>Filenamemask</EM>, if any.

			The <STRONG>~</STRONG> (tilde) character may be used to specify a
			user's home directory, ala unix shell tilde
			expansion.

	   (<EM>Directory)</EM> <EM>Alternatives</EM>
			Pressing mouse button 1 on a directory name in the
			directory alternatives list will do a ``change
			directory'' to that directory.

			Pressing mouse button 3 in either the file or
			<EM>Directory</EM> <EM>Alternatives</EM> window will do a ``change
			directory'' to the parent directory.

	   <EM>Load</EM>/<EM>Merge</EM> <EM>figure</EM> <EM>offset</EM>
			These two editable AsciiTextWidgets allow one to
			load or merge a figure with an offset on the
			canvas.  The figure will be offset by the amounts
			specified (in Fig units) in the X and Y panels.  A
			negative value in the X offset will shift the
			figure to the left, and a negative value in the Y
			offset will shift the figure up.

	   <EM>Home</EM> Pressing this button will change the directory to
			the $<EM>HOME</EM> directory of the user.

	   <EM>Rescan</EM>
			Pressing this button or &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>r</STRONG> will rescan the
			current directory.

	   <EM>Cancel</EM>
			Pressing this button or &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>c</STRONG> will pop down the
			<EM>File</EM> panel without making any changes to the
			directory or file name.

	   <EM>Save</EM> Pressing this button or &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>s</STRONG> will save the
			current contents of the canvas in the file
			specified in the <EM>Filename</EM> window <EM>if</EM> <EM>any</EM>, or the
			name specified in the <EM>Current</EM> <EM>Filename</EM> if the
			former is empty.  If the file already exists a
			confirmation popup menu will appear asking the
			user to confirm or cancel the save.  If there is a
			filename in the <EM>Filename</EM> window it is copied to
			the <EM>Current</EM> <EM>Filename</EM> window.

			The current Export directory is updated to the
			current File directory when Save is pressed.

			Before the figure is saved the original file is
			first renamed with the suffix ``.bak'' appended.
			This provides a backup file.

	   <EM>Load</EM> Pressing this button or &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>l</STRONG> will clear the
			canvas of any current figure and read the figure
			from the filename specified in the <EM>Filename</EM> menu
			item <EM>if</EM> <EM>any</EM>, or the name specified in the <EM>Current</EM>
			<EM>Filename</EM> if the former is empty.  The figure will
			be offset by the amounts specified (Fig units) in
			the X and Y load/merge offset widgets.  If there
			is a figure currently on the canvas and any
			modifications have been made to it and not saved,
			a popup query window will first appear asking if
			the user wishes to discard the current figure or
			cancel the <EM>Load</EM> operation.

			The current Export directory is updated to the
			current File directory when Load is pressed.

			A popup message window will appear and diagnostic
			messages will be written if <EM>xfig</EM> changes any
			``illegal'' object values to legal values.  For
			example, older versions of <EM>xfig</EM> were lax about
			initializing unused parts such as <EM>depth</EM>, and would
			produce very large, random values.  <EM>Xfig</EM> now will
			``clean up'' bad values and inform you when it
			does so.  Also, if you read in an older file
			format, <EM>xfig</EM> will inform you that it is converting
			it to the current format for that version of <EM>xfig</EM>.
			This window can be popped down by clicking the
			mouse button on the <EM>Dismiss</EM> button.

	   <EM>Merge</EM> <EM>Read</EM>
			Pressing this button or &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>r</STRONG> will read the
			figure from the filename specified in the <EM>Filename</EM>
			window <EM>if</EM> <EM>any</EM>, or the name specified in the
			<EM>Current</EM> <EM>Filename</EM> if the former is empty, and merge
			it with the figure already shown on the canvas.
			The figure will be offset by the amounts specified
			(Fig units) in the X and Y load/merge offset
			widgets.  Any user-defined colors in the file
			being merged will be renumbered if necessary to
			unique values so as not to conflict with any
			user-defined colors already defined.  There is <EM>no</EM>
			comparison of the color values of the existing
			user-defined colors with the colors being merged
			in so there may be identical colors with different
			numbers.

			See <EM>Load</EM> above for a description of the popup
			message window.

  <EM>Export</EM>
	   Will let you export the figure to an output file in one
	   of several formats.  Pressing mouse button 3 on this
	   button invokes <EM>Export</EM> function without popping up the
	   export panel.
	   Mouse button 1 or &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>e</STRONG> pops up a directory browser
	   widget and a menu with several export-related
	   functions:
	   <EM>Magnification</EM>
			This is an editable AsciiTextWidget which contains
			the magnification to use when translating figure
			to the output language.  The default is 100%.

	   <EM>Orientation</EM>
			This button will toggle the output orientation
			between Landscape (horizontal) and Portrait
			(vertical).  The default orientation is the same
			as the mode that <EM>xfig</EM> was started with, or the
			orientation in the Fig file when loading a Fig
			file of version 3.0 or higher.

	   <EM>Justification</EM>
			This window will only be sensitive when the
			language selected is ``ps'' (<EM>PostScript)</EM>.  You may
			choose that the figure is <EM>flush</EM> <EM>left</EM> or <EM>centered</EM>
			in the output file.  <EM>Export</EM> <EM>Offset</EM> These two
			editable AsciiTextWidgets allow one to export a
			figure with an offset.  The figure will be offset
			by the amounts specified (in inches or cm) in the
			X and Y panels.  A negative value in the X offset
			will shift the figure to the left, and a negative
			value in the Y offset will shift the figure up.
			These offsets are in addition to any centering
			done with the centering option.

	   <EM>Language</EM>
			The translation language to use for <EM>xfig</EM> output.
			The default is <EM>PostScript</EM>.  The figure may be
			saved as an X11 bitmap by choosing <EM>X11</EM> <EM>Bitmap</EM> as
			the output language.  The bitmap(pixmap) is
			created from the figure, the size of which is
			determined by the enclosing rectangle of all the
			figure plus a small border.
			The figure may also be saved as an color X11
			pixmap (using the XPM3 package) by choosing <EM>X11</EM>
			<EM>Pixmap</EM> as the output language, or as a <EM>GIF</EM> file.
			Finally, the figure may be saved as a <EM>JPEG</EM> image
			in a JFIF file.  The quality factor for exporting
			JPEG is fixed at 75.  This seems to be fine for
			figures containing only solid objects (no images)
			and adequate for figures containing imported
			images (GIF, JPEG, etc.).

	   <EM>Default</EM> <EM>Output</EM> <EM>Filename</EM>
			This is read-only AsciiTextWidget which contains
			the filename that will be used to write output to
			a file <EM>if</EM> <EM>there</EM> <EM>is</EM> <EM>no</EM> <EM>name</EM> <EM>specified</EM> <EM>in</EM> Output
			File.  The default is the figure name plus an
			extension that reflects the output language used,
			e.g.  <STRONG>myfigure.ps</STRONG> if <EM>PostScript</EM> is the current
			language used.  If the file already exists a
			confirmation popup menu will appear asking the
			user to confirm or cancel the save.

	   <EM>Output</EM> <EM>Filename</EM>
			This is an editable AsciiTextWidget which contains
			the filename to use to write output to a file.
			Pressing return in this window will <EM>Export</EM> the
			file and copy the name to the <EM>Default</EM> <EM>Output</EM>
			<EM>Filename</EM> widget.  If the file already exists a
			confirmation popup menu will appear asking the
			user to confirm or cancel the save.

	   (<EM>File)</EM> <EM>Alternatives</EM>
			Pressing mouse button 1 on a filename in the file
			alternatives window will select that file by
			copying the filename into <EM>Filename</EM> window.
			Pressing return in this window will <EM>Export</EM> the
			file and copy the name to the <EM>Default</EM> <EM>Output</EM>
			<EM>Filename</EM> widget.

	   <EM>Filename</EM> <EM>Mask</EM>
			A wildcard mask may be typed into this editable
			AsciiTextWidget to restrict the search of
			filenames to a subset ala the <EM>ls</EM> command.
			Pressing return in this window will automatically
			rescan the current directory.  This string may be
			set by setting the X toolkit resource
			<STRONG>Fig*export_panel*mask*string</STRONG>.

	   <EM>Current</EM> <EM>Directory</EM>
			This is an editable AsciiTextWidget which shows
			the current directory.  It may be modified by the
			user to manually set a directory name.  When
			return is pressed in this window the directory
			specified is scanned for files matching the
			<EM>Filenamemask</EM>, if any.

			It is automatically updated to follow the current
			File directory when a File Load or Save is done.

			The <STRONG>~</STRONG> (tilde) character may be used to specify a
			user's home directory, ala unix shell tilde
			expansion.

	   (<EM>Directory)</EM> <EM>Alternatives</EM>
			Pressing mouse button 1 on a directory name in the
			directory alternatives list will do a ``change
			directory'' to that directory.

			Pressing mouse button 3 in either the file or
			<EM>Directory</EM> <EM>Alternatives</EM> window will do a ``change
			directory'' to the parent directory.

	   <EM>Home</EM> Pressing this button will change the directory to
			the $<EM>HOME</EM> directory of the user.

	   <EM>Rescan</EM>
			Pressing this button or &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>r</STRONG> will rescan the
			current directory.

	   <EM>Cancel</EM>
			Pressing this button or &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>c</STRONG> will pop down the
			<EM>Export</EM> menu without doing any print operation.

	   <EM>Export</EM>
			Pressing this button or &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>e</STRONG> will write
			(export) the figure to the file using the selected
			language.  If the file already exists, a
			confirmation window will popup to ask the user to
			confirm the write or cancel.  Pressing return in
			the Output Filename window will also Export the
			file.

  <EM>Print</EM>
	   Pressing mouse button 3 on this button invokes <EM>Print</EM> <EM>to</EM>
	   <EM>Printer</EM> function without popping up the print panel.
	   Pressing the <EM>Shift</EM> key and mouse button 3 invokes the
	   <EM>Print</EM> <EM>to</EM> <EM>Batch</EM> function.  Pressing mouse button 1 or
	   &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>p</STRONG> pops up a menu with several print-related
	   functions:

	   <EM>Magnification</EM>
			This is an AsciiTextWidget which contains the
			magnification to use when translating figure to
			the output language.

	   <EM>Orientation</EM>
			This button will toggle the output orientation
			between Landscape (horizontal) and Portrait
			(vertical).  The default orientation is the same
			as the mode that <EM>xfig</EM> was started with, or the
			orientation in the Fig file when loading a Fig
			file of version 3.0 or higher.

	   <EM>Justification</EM>
			This button will bring up a sub-menu from which
			you may choose <EM>center</EM> or <EM>flush</EM> <EM>left</EM> to justify the
			figure on the page.  The default is <EM>flush</EM> <EM>left</EM>.

	   <EM>Printer</EM>
			This is an AsciiTextWidget which contains the
			printer to use if output is directed to a printer.
			The name of the printer may be set setting the X
			toolkit resource <STRONG>Fig*printer*string</STRONG>.  If no
			resource is set, the environment variable <EM>PRINTER</EM>
			is used.

	   <EM>Print</EM> <EM>Job</EM> <EM>Params</EM>
			This is an AsciiTextWidget which into which you
			may put any extra command-line parameters that
			your lpr or lp program needs for printing.  If the
			meta sequence %<STRONG>f</STRONG> appears in the string the current
			figure name will be substituted.  It may appear
			more than once.  This may be set using the
			resource <STRONG>Fig*job_params*string</STRONG>.

	   <EM>Figures</EM> <EM>in</EM> <EM>batch</EM>
			This indicator shows how many figures have been
			put in the batch file for printing

	   <EM>Dismiss</EM>
			Pressing this button or &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>c</STRONG> will pop down the
			<EM>Print</EM> menu.

	   <EM>Print</EM> <EM>FIGURE</EM>/<EM>BATCH</EM> <EM>to</EM> <EM>Printer</EM>
			Pressing this button or &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>p</STRONG> will send the
			current figure (or the batch file if it is has any
			figures in it) to the printer, by passing it
			through <EM>fig2dev</EM> to convert it to <EM>PostScript</EM> then
			to the unix <EM>lpr</EM> (on BSD equivalent Unixes) or <EM>lp</EM>
			(on SYSV systems) program.  If the batch file is
			printed by this button then it is removed after
			printing.  The message in the button changes to
			reflect whether the batch file will be printed
			(when there are any figures in the batch file) or
			the current figure.

			Note that the figure that is printed is what you
			see on the canvas, not necessarily the figure
			file.  I.e., if you haven't saved the figure since
			the last changes, the figure from the canvas is
			printed.  <EM>Xfig</EM> writes the figure to a temporary
			file to do this.  The name of the file is
			<EM>XFIGTMPDIR</EM><STRONG>/xfig-print</STRONG><EM>PID</EM>, where <EM>XFIGTMPDIR</EM> is the
			value of the environment variable by that name and
			<EM>PID</EM> is the process ID of <EM>xfig</EM>.  If the environment
			variable <EM>XFIGTMPDIR</EM> is empty or not set, the <STRONG>/tmp</STRONG>
			directory is used.  <EM>Print</EM> <EM>FIGURE</EM> <EM>to</EM> <EM>Batch</EM> Pressing
			this button or &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>b</STRONG> will append the figure (in
			<EM>PostScript</EM> form) to a batch file.  The <EM>Print</EM> <EM>to</EM>
			<EM>Printer</EM> button will send the batch file to the
			printer.

	   <EM>Clear</EM> <EM>Batch</EM>
			Pressing this button or &lt;<EM>Meta</EM>&gt;<STRONG>x</STRONG> will erase the
			accumulated figures from the batch file.

<STRONG>INDICATOR</STRONG> <STRONG>PANEL</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMAND</STRONG> <STRONG>DESCRIPTIONS</STRONG>
  The indicator panel contains buttons to set certain drawing
  parameters such as line thickness, canvas grid, rotation
  angle etc.  All of the buttons use the same mouse buttons
  for setting values.  Pressing mouse button 1 on the
  indicator will pop up a panel in which either a value may be
  typed (e.g. for a line thickness) or the mouse may be
  clicked on one of several buttons (e.g. for grid style or
  font name).  For those that expect a value, pressing return
  in the value part of the window will set the new value and
  pop down the menu.

  Pressing mouse button 2 on an indicator will decrement the
  value (e.g. for line thickness) or cycle through the options
  in one direction (e.g. font names), while pressing mouse
  button 3 will increment the value or cycle through the
  options in the other direction.

  <EM>ZOOM</EM> <EM>SCALE</EM>
	   The canvas zoom scale may be set/increased/decreased
	   with this button.  The zoom scale is displayed within
	   the zoom button.  Ruler, grid and linewidth are scaled,
	   too.  Pressing mouse button 2 will decrease the zoom
	   factor by 1.0 unless it is less than 1.0 already in
	   which case it will reduce to the nearest 0.25.
	   Pressing mouse button 3 will increase the zoom factor
	   by 1.0 unless it is less than 1.0 in which case it will
	   increase it to the nearest 0.25.  Pressing the control
	   key and mouse button 3 together will set the zoom scale
	   to 1.

	   The figure may also be zoomed by defining a zoom
	   rectangle by pressing the control key and mouse button
	   1 together.  This will define one corner of the zoom
	   rectangle.  Move the mouse and click mouse button 1
	   again to define the opposite corner of the zoom
	   rectangle.

  <EM>GRID</EM> <EM>MODE</EM>
	   With this button the user may select no grid, 1/4 inch
	   (5mm in metric mode) grid 1/2 inch (10mm) grid, or 1
	   inch (20mm).

  <EM>POINT</EM> <EM>POSITION</EM>
	   This button controls the coarseness of object placement
	   on the canvas.  The options are exact (on pixel)
	   placement, 1/16 inch (1mm in metric mode), 1/4 inch
	   (5mm) or 1/2 inch (10mm).  This allows the user to
	   easily place objects in horizontal or vertical
	   alignment.
	   This also restricts which objects may be ``picked up''
	   by the mouse when editing.  If a corner of an object is
	   not positioned on the canvas on a multiple of the point
	   positioning resolution you may not be able to pick it.
	   If this happens, a black square will temporarily appear
	   above the mouse cursor.  This square will also appear
	   anytime the user tries to pick a nonexistent object.

  <EM>ROTATION</EM> <EM>ANGLE</EM>
	   The rotation angle for rotating objects may be
	   set/increased/decreased with this button.  Note that
	   not all objects may be rotated, and certain objects may
	   only be rotated by certain angles.  Pressing mouse
	   button 2 will decrease the angle in steps of 15
	   degrees, while mouse button 3 will increase the angle
	   the same amount.  To select other angles, press mouse
	   button 1 and enter the angle in the popup menu.

  <EM>DEPTH</EM>
	   The depth at which new objects will be created may be
	   set/increased/decreased with this button.

  <EM>NUMBER</EM> <EM>OF</EM> <EM>POLYGON</EM> <EM>SIDES</EM>
	   The number of sides used in creating a <EM>REGULAR</EM> <EM>POLYGON</EM>
	   is set with this button.

  <EM>NUMBER</EM> <EM>OF</EM> <EM>COPIES</EM>
	   The number of copies to make when doing a <EM>COPY</EM> &amp; <EM>ROTATE</EM>
	   function on an object.  Each copy will be rotated an
	   additional <EM>ROTATION</EM> <EM>ANGLE</EM> angle from the previous.

  <EM>NUMBER</EM> <EM>OF</EM> <STRONG>X</STRONG> (<EM>or</EM> <STRONG>Y</STRONG>) <EM>COPIES</EM>
	   The number of copies to make in the X (or Y) direction
	   when doing a <EM>COPY</EM> function on an object.

  <EM>SMART</EM>-<EM>LINKS</EM> <EM>MODE</EM>
	   This button controls the smart-links mode.  When turned
	   on, lines which link box-like objects together
	   (henceforth called <EM>links)</EM> are treated specially when
	   one of the box-like objects is moved.  When set to <EM>MOVE</EM>
	   mode, the end point of the link which touches (or is
	   very near) the perimeter of the box is moved with the
	   box so that the box and the end point remain linked.
	   When set to <EM>SLIDE</EM> mode, the end segment of the link
	   slides so that the box remains linked and the angle of
	   the end segment is maintained.  This is useful for
	   keeping the last segment of a link horizontal or
	   vertical.

	   (At the moment, this mode only works for the <EM>MOVE</EM> and
	   <EM>COPY</EM> functions and only works for <EM>POLYLINE</EM> links and
	   box-like objects.  Another limitation at the moment is
	   that if both ends of a link touch the box being
	   operated on, only one end of the link will be
	   adjusted.)

  <EM>VERTICAL</EM> <EM>ALIGN</EM>
	   This sets the vertical alignment mode for the <EM>ALIGN</EM>
	   button in the editing mode panel.  The choices are no
	   vertical alignment, align to top edge, middle or bottom
	   edge of compound, distribute the centres or edges
	   evenly, or abut the vertical edges together.  The
	   <EM>HORIZONTAL</EM> <EM>ALIGN</EM> and <EM>VERTICAL</EM> <EM>ALIGN</EM> indicator settings
	   are used together to align objects inside a compound or
	   in canvas.

  <EM>HORIZONTAL</EM> <EM>ALIGN</EM>
	   This sets the horizontal alignment mode for the <EM>ALIGN</EM>
	   button in the editing mode panel.  The choices are no
	   horizontal alignment, align to left edge, middle or
	   right edge of compound, distribute the centres or edges
	   evenly, or abut the horizonaal edges together.  The
	   <EM>HORIZONTAL</EM> <EM>ALIGN</EM> and <EM>VERTICAL</EM> <EM>ALIGN</EM> indicator settings
	   are used together to align objects inside a compound or
	   in canvas.

  <EM>ANGLE</EM> <EM>GEOMETRY</EM>
	   The following settings are available to restrict the
	   drawing angle of line segments in <EM>POLYLINES</EM>, <EM>POLYGONS</EM>
			and <EM>SPLINES</EM>.

	   <EM>UNRESTRICTED</EM>
			Allow lines to be drawn with any slope.  This is
			the default setting.

	   <EM>LATEX</EM> <EM>LINE</EM>
			Allow lines to be drawn only at slopes which can
			be handled by <EM>LaTeX</EM> picture environment lines:
			slope = <STRONG>x</STRONG>/<STRONG>y</STRONG>, where x,y are integers in the range
			[-6,6].

	   <EM>LATEX</EM> <EM>VECTOR</EM>
			Allow lines to be drawn only at slopes which can
			be handled by <EM>LaTeX</EM> picture environment vectors:
			slope = <STRONG>x</STRONG>/<STRONG>y</STRONG>, where x,y are integers in the range
			[-4,4].

	   <EM>MANHATTAN</EM>-<EM>MOUNTAIN</EM>
			Allow lines to be drawn in the horizontal,
			vertical or diagonal direction only.

	   <EM>MANHATTAN</EM>
			Enforce drawing of lines in the horizontal and
			vertical direction only.  The name <EM>Manhattan</EM> comes
			from the horizontal/vertical look of the Manhattan
			(New York City) skyline.

	   <EM>MOUNTAIN</EM>
			Enforce drawing of only diagonal lines.  The name
			comes from the pointed shape of mountains.

  <EM>FILL</EM> <EM>STYLE</EM>
	   This button allows the user to select the area fill
	   darkness (grey scale or color intensity) or fill
	   patterns for all objects except <EM>TEXT</EM> and <EM>PICTURE</EM>, or to
	   turn off area fill altogether.

	   There are 21 ``shades'' going from black to full
	   saturation of the fill color, and 21 more ``tints''
	   from full saturation + 1 to white.  In addition, there
	   are 16 patterns (currently only available for
	   PostScript, GIF, JPEG, XPM and X11 bitmap output):
			30 degree left-leaning diagonal lines,
			30 degree right-leaning diagonal lines,
			30 degree crosshatch,
			45 degree left-leaning diagonal lines,
			45 degree right-leaning diagonal lines,
			45 degree crosshatch,
			bricks,
			circles
			horizontal lines,
			vertical lines,
			90 degree crosshatch,
			fishscales,
			small fishscales,
			octagons,
			horizontal ``sawtooth'' and
			vertical ``sawtooth''.

  <EM>PEN</EM> <EM>COLOR</EM>
	   This button is used to select one of 32 standard colors
	   for the borders of objects, or one of the user-defined
	   colors

  <EM>FILL</EM> <EM>COLOR</EM>
	   This button is used to select one of 32 standard colors
	   or user-defined color to fill objects with if they have
	   a fill style.

	   Pressing mouse button 1 on either the fill or pen color
	   buttons will popup an extended color panel, allowing
	   the user to select either a standard color or a user-
	   defined color from menus.

	   The 32 standard colors are black, yellow, white, gold,
	   five shades of blue, four shades of green, four shades
	   of cyan, four shades of red, five shades of magenta,
	   four shades of brown, and four shades of pink.

	   To select one of the standard colors either click mouse
	   button 1 on the desired color and either press Return
	   or click mouse button 1 on the "Ok" button.  The latter
	   step will pop down the color panel.  You may also
	   double click mouse button 1 on the desired color to
	   select it and pop down the color panel in one step.

	   To add a user-defined color press mouse button on the
	   ``Add Color'' button in the ``User Defined Colors''
	   section.  User defined colors are assigned values
	   sequentially starting from 32 for a maximum of 512
	   colors.

	   A user color may be deleted by pressing mouse button 1
	   on the color box to select it and then pressing the
	   ``Del Color'' button.

	   The last color deleted may be undeleted by pressing the
	   ``UnDel Color'' button.

	   To edit a user color first select the color square by
	   pressing mouse button 1 on the desired square. A solid
	   or dashed line will be drawn around the box to show
	   that it is selected.  Then choose the color either by
	   using the RGB (red, green, blue) or the HSV (hue,
	   saturation, value) sliders.  or by typing a hexadecimal
	   value into the window under the pen or fill color boxes
	   representing the red, green and blue components (00 to
	   FF).  If the latter is used, typing carriage return in
	   the hexadecimal window will set the color.

	   Additionally, there is a button above each of the RGB
	   sliders which when activated will ``lock'' two or more
	   sliders together at their current setting and allow you
	   to increase or decrease their values together with the
	   ``lock'' slider.

	   If the user color being edited was just created, a
	   dashed line will be drawn around the box instead of a
	   solid line to indicate that it is new.  The color that
	   is currently in the pen or fill boxes will be copied
	   into the user color cell for modification.  In this way
	   you may start with a standard color or other user color
	   and modify it from there.

	   The user color is said to be ``defined'' when any of
	   the sliders is moved or a carriage return is typed into
	   the hexadecimal window.  This will be shown by a solid
	   line being drawn around the square instead of dashed.
	   The pen or fill color choice is activated when the
	   panel is popped up by the respective button in the
	   indicator panel, but you may switch to editing the
	   other color by pressing either the ``Edit Pen'' or
	   ``Edit Fill'' button.

	   Note that <EM>TransFig</EM> supports color output for
	   <EM>PostScript</EM>.  On monochrome screens the objects are
	   created with the selected color, but black (or white)
	   is used to draw the objects on the canvas.

  <EM>LINE</EM> <EM>WIDTH</EM>
	   The width of lines may be selected with this button.
	   Zero width lines may be drawn for the purpose of having
	   filled areas without outlines.

  <EM>LINE</EM> <EM>STYLE</EM>
	   The choices for line style are solid, dashed and
	   dotted.  Once created, a dashed or dotted line may be
	   edited to change the length of dashes or the spacing of
	   dots respectively.  The dash length and dot gap can be
	   changed from the default using the popup menu.

  <EM>JOIN</EM> <EM>STYLE</EM>
	   Lines may be joined with a <EM>miter</EM>, <EM>rounded</EM> or <EM>bevel</EM>
	   joint.  This is only used for <EM>POLYLINE</EM> or <EM>POLYGON</EM>
	   objects.

  <EM>CAP</EM> <EM>STYLE</EM>
	   The ends of lines may be capped with <EM>butt</EM>, <EM>round</EM> or
	   <EM>projecting</EM> cap.  This is only used for <EM>POLYLINE</EM>, <EM>SPLINE</EM>
	   or <EM>OPEN</EM> <EM>ARC</EM> objects.

  <EM>ARROW</EM> <EM>MODE</EM>
	   This button selects the auto-arrow mode for drawing
	   lines.  The options are no arrow heads, backward-
	   pointing arrow head, forward-pointing arrow head or
	   both.  If one or both arrow head modes are turned on,
	   then arrow heads are automatically drawn when drawing
	   <EM>POLYLINE</EM>, <EM>SPLINE</EM> or <EM>OPEN</EM> <EM>ARC</EM> objects.

  <EM>ARROW</EM> <EM>TYPE</EM>
	   There are four types of arrows which may be filled with
	   white or the object color.

  <EM>BOX</EM> <EM>CURVE</EM>
	   The radius of the corners on <EM>ARC</EM>-<EM>BOX</EM> objects may be set
	   with this button.

  <EM>TEXT</EM> <EM>JUSTIFICATION</EM>
	   The adjustment of text may be set to <EM>left</EM>, <EM>center</EM> or
	   <EM>right</EM> <EM>justification</EM>.

  <EM>TEXT</EM> <EM>SIZE</EM>
	   The text size may be set/increased/decreased with this
	   button.  The default is 12 points.

  <EM>TEXT</EM> <EM>STEP</EM>
	   The interline spacing of text may be
	   set/increased/decreased with this button.  The number
	   displayed gives the multiple of the font height that
	   will be placed between lines on hitting &lt;<EM>return</EM>&gt;.  The
	   default is a factor of 1.2 times the current font size.

  <EM>TEXT</EM> <EM>FONT</EM>
	   This button allows a selection of 35 fonts available
	   for most Apple <EM>PostScript</EM> printers.  There are two
	   buttons at the top of the menu.  The <EM>cancel</EM> button pops
	   down the menu without changing the current font.  The
	   <EM>use</EM> <EM>latex</EM> <EM>fonts</EM> will switch the menu to the <EM>LaTeX</EM> font
	   choices.  When the <EM>LaTeX</EM> font menu is up, besides a
	   <EM>cancel</EM> button there is a button to switch back to the
	   <EM>PostScript</EM> fonts.

	   The name of the font is printed in the font itself so
	   that one may see what that font looks like.  If a
	   corresponding X11 font exists, new text is created on
	   the canvas using that font.  <EM>xfig</EM> uses the size of X11
	   font closest to that selected by the font size button.
	   If the X11 font doesn't exist, <EM>xfig</EM> uses the font
	   selected by the <STRONG>-normal</STRONG> option.  To abort selection of
	   a font, click mouse button 1 on <EM>cancel</EM>.

  <EM>TEXT</EM> <EM>FLAGS</EM>
	   This button displays the current setting of the text
	   flags.  You may use mouse buttons 2 and 3 to step back
	   and forth through the three flag settings: <EM>Hidden</EM>,
	   <EM>Rigid</EM> and <EM>Special</EM>.  To change any of the flags you must
	   use mouse button 1 to popup a menu from which you may
	   change any or all of the flags.

	   The <EM>Hidden</EM> flag is used for figures that will be used
	   with <EM>LaTeX</EM> and is applicable only to the display of the
	   document in <EM>xfig</EM>.  It means that the text itself is not
	   shown onscreen, but only the string "&lt;text&gt;".  This is
	   to keep long sequences of <EM>LaTeX</EM> formatting commands
	   from making the screen messy and hard to read.  The
	   default for the <EM>Hidden</EM> flag is <EM>off</EM>.

	   The <EM>Special</EM> Special flag means that special characters
	   in the string are not specially processed but are
	   passed directly to <EM>LaTeX</EM>.  If this flag is not set,
	   then the backslash character '\' is changed to the
	   \backslash command, a brace '{' is turned into a brace
	   command \{, etc.  The default for the <EM>Special</EM> flag is
	   <EM>off</EM> unless <EM>xfig</EM> is started with the command-line
	   parameter <STRONG>-specialtext</STRONG> (resource specialtext).

	   The <EM>Rigid</EM> attribute forces text to remain the same size
	   even if inside a compound object that is scaled up or
	   down.  The default is <EM>off</EM>.

<STRONG>DRAWING</STRONG> <STRONG>AND</STRONG> <STRONG>EDITING</STRONG> <STRONG>MODE</STRONG> <STRONG>PANELS</STRONG>
  Icons in the drawing and editing mode panel windows
  represent object manipulation functions, modes and other
  drawing or modification aids.  Manipulation functions are
  selected by positioning the cursor over the icon
  representing the desired drawing/editing function and
  clicking mouse button 1.  The selected icon is highlighted,
  and a message describing its function appears in the message
  window.  The hilighting remains on until another function is
  selected.

<STRONG>DRAWING</STRONG> <STRONG>MODE</STRONG> <STRONG>PANEL</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMAND</STRONG> <STRONG>DESCRIPTIONS</STRONG>
  The drawing mode panel contains buttons used to create the
  various <EM>xfig</EM> objects.  Once the drawing mode is selected,
  the object is created by moving the mouse to the point on
  the canvas where the object is to be placed and pressing and
  releasing mouse button 1.  After that the mouse is moved to
  the second point and mouse button 1 is again pressed for the
  next point.  For those objects which may have more than two
  points (e.g. a line), mouse button 1 may be pressed for each
  successive point, and mouse button 2 must be pressed to
  finish the object.  To create a single point using the
  <EM>POLYLINE</EM> button, press and release mouse button 2.  Newly
  created points may be deleted by pressing the shift key and
  mouse button 1.  For the <EM>ARC</EM> object, which requires exactly
  three points mouse button 1 is used for all three points.

  At any time mouse button 3 may be pressed to cancel the
  creation of the object.

  <EM>ARC</EM>  Create an arc.  Specify three points using mouse button
	   1.  The first and last points will form the endpoints
	   of the arc and the second specifies any point on the
	   arc.  There are two types of arcs, open and pie-wedge.

  <EM>BOX</EM>  Create rectangular boxes.  Start by clicking mouse
	   button 1 on any corner of the desired box and finish
	   with the same mouse button on the diagonally opposite
	   corner of the box.

  <EM>ARC</EM>-<EM>BOX</EM>
	   Create rectangular boxes with rounded corners.  Start
	   and finish with mouse button 1 in the same way as <EM>BOX</EM>.
	   The radius of the corners is selected by the <EM>BOX</EM> <EM>CURVE</EM>
	   button.

  <EM>CIRCLE</EM>
	   Create circles by specifying their radii or diameters.
	   Click mouse button 1 on the center of the circle and
	   drag the mouse until the desired radius or diameter is
	   attained.  Click mouse button 1 again to finish the
	   circle.

  <EM>ELLIPSE</EM>
	   Create ellipses using the same procedure as for the
	   drawing of circles.

  <EM>PICTURE</EM> <EM>OBJECT</EM> (<EM>PIC)</EM>
	   This has been changed from the previous (2.1) version
	   to be more generic, allowing GIF files, JPEG (JFIF)
	   files, X11 bitmap (monochrome) files and X11 pixmap
	   (XPM3) color files in addition to Encapsulated
	   PostScript files to be imported.  Compressed (.Z) and
	   gzipped (.z or .gz) files are also handled.  You must
	   have the XPM3 libraries installed to use the XPM
	   import/export features.  See the README and Imakefile
	   files.

	   A Floyd-Steinberg dithering is applied to color images
	   for monochrome displays.

	   For EPS files, xfig will attempt to use <EM>Ghostscript</EM> to
	   generate a color image if xfig is running on an color
	   display.  <EM>Ghostscript</EM> must be compiled with with the
	   "gif8" and "pbmraw" drivers.  The pbm driver is used
	   when you run xfig on a monochrome display and the gif8
	   driver is used on a color display.

	   <EM>Ghostscript</EM> is available from <EM>prep.ai</EM>.<EM>mit.edu</EM>.

	   A neural network color allocation scheme is used when
	   the number of colors for all the color images on the
	   canvas exceeds the lesser of the number of free
	   colorcells or the value in the resource
	   Max_image_colors (command-line parameter
	   -max_image_colors).  Whenever a new color image is
	   added to the canvas, the colors for all the images on
	   the canvas are reallocated and the images are redrawn.
	   No reallocation is done when images are deleted from
	   the canvas.

	   Click mouse button 1 on any corner for the <EM>PIC</EM> object
	   and finish by clicking mouse button 1 again on the
	   diagonally opposite corner.  The <EM>EDIT</EM> popup panel will
	   appear and the file name of the <EM>PIC</EM> object may be
	   entered.  After pressing <EM>DONE</EM> or <EM>APPLY</EM> (see the
	   description of the <EM>EDIT</EM> panel for the difference
	   between the <EM>DONE</EM> and <EM>APPLY</EM> buttons) the bitmap part of
	   the <EM>PIC</EM> object will appear in the box just created.  If
	   no <EM>PIC</EM> file is available yet or no name is entered or
	   in the case of an Encapsulated PostScript file there is
	   no <EM>preview</EM> <EM>bitmap</EM> pressing <EM>DONE</EM> will pop down the edit
	   panel and the word &lt;<EM>empty</EM>&gt; or the <EM>PIC</EM> file name will
	   remain in the <EM>PIC</EM> box.  Later, when the name of the <EM>PIC</EM>
	   file is known or the file is available, you may re-read
	   the <EM>PIC</EM> file using the popup edit panel and the bitmap
	   part of the <EM>PIC</EM> file will replace the name in the box.

	   If you want the original size of the <EM>PIC</EM> object, press
	   the ``Use orig size'' button and the eps bitmap will
	   enlarge or shrink to the size specified in the preview
	   bitmap of the <EM>PIC</EM> file.  If you want the <EM>PIC</EM> object to
	   be approximately the size of the rectangle specified
	   with the mouse but want the aspect ratio to be same as
	   the original, press either ``Shrink to orig'' or
	   ``Enlarge to orig'' buttons.  You must press the <EM>APPLY</EM>
	   button to see these effects.

	   The <EM>Screen</EM> <EM>Capture</EM> button will unmap the xfig windows,
	   allowing you to capture a rectangular section of the
	   screen to a GIF file, which becomes the current import
	   file.  After pressing the <EM>Screen</EM> <EM>Capture</EM> button you
	   press and release mouse button 1 at one corner of the
	   area of the screen you want to capture, drag out the
	   rectangle and press and release mouse button 1 to
	   finish.  You may cancel the operation by pressing
	   either of the two other mouse buttons.

	   The <EM>Edit</EM> <EM>Image</EM> button will call an external image
	   viewer/editor (see resource Fig.image_editor: in the
	   Fig.ad file) to allow you to edit the current image.
	   The file is reimported automatically after exiting the
	   editor.  The xfig windows are automatically unmapped
	   during the call of the editor.

	   The <EM>Reread</EM> button will cause xfig to re-read the image
	   file in case it has changed.  This is useful (e.g.)
	   when you have made changes to the image file in a
	   program external to xfig and you wish to update the
	   imported image.

	   The <EM>Browse</EM> button which will popup a file browser to
	   allow you to search directories for image files.  The
	   default search mask will match *.gif*, *.jpg*, *.xpm*,
	   *.xbm* and *.eps*.  This mask is in the Fig.ad
	   application defaults file.

  <EM>INTERPOLATED</EM> <EM>SPLINE</EM>
	   Create (cubic spline) spline objects.  Enter control
	   vectors in the same way as for creation of a <EM>POLYLINE</EM>
	   object.  At least three points (two control vectors)
	   must be entered.  The spline will pass through the
	   entered points.  Newly created points may be deleted by
	   pressing the shift key and mouse button 1 before
	   pressing mouse button 2.

  <EM>POLYLINE</EM>
	   Create polylines (line segments connecting a sequence
	   of points).  Enter points by clicking mouse button 1 at
	   the desired positions on the canvas window.  Click
	   mouse button 2 to finish.  Newly created points may be
	   deleted by pressing the shift key and mouse button 1
	   before pressing mouse button 2.

  <EM>POLYGON</EM>
	   Same as <EM>POLYLINE</EM> except that a line segment is drawn
	   connecting the first and last points entered.

  <EM>REGULAR</EM> <EM>POLYGON</EM>
	   The number of sides is first selected with the <EM>NUM</EM>
	   <EM>SIDES</EM> button in the indicator panel.  Then mouse button
	   1 is clicked on the center and the mouse dragged to the
	   desired size.  The object may be rotated as it is being
	   created by moving the mouse up or down relative to the
	   starting point.  Click mouse button 1 to finish.

  <EM>CLOSED</EM> <EM>INTERPOLATED</EM> <EM>SPLINE</EM>
	   Create closed or periodic splines.  The function is
	   similar to <EM>POLYGON</EM> except that a closed interpolated
	   spline is drawn.  The spline will pass through the
	   points (knots).

  <EM>CLOSED</EM> <EM>SPLINE</EM>
	   Create closed or periodic spline objects.  The function
	   is similar to <EM>POLYGON</EM> except that a closed spline will
	   be drawn instead of polygon.  The entered points are
	   just control points; i.e. the spline will not pass any
	   of these points.  Newly created points may be deleted
	   by pressing the shift key and mouse button 1 before
	   pressing mouse button 2.

  <EM>SPLINE</EM>
	   Create (quadratic spline) spline objects.  Enter
	   control vectors in the same way as for creation of a
	   <EM>POLYLINE</EM> object.  At least three points (two control
	   vectors) must be entered.  The spline will only pass
	   through the two end points.  Newly created points may
	   be deleted by pressing the shift key and mouse button 1
	   before pressing mouse button 2.

  <EM>TEXT</EM> Create text strings.  Click mouse button 1 at the
	   desired position on the canvas window, then enter text
	   from the keyboard.  Text may be pasted from the PRIMARY
	   cut buffer (<EM>xterm</EM> cut/paste buffer) by pressing the <EM>F18</EM>
	   function key (the <EM>Paste</EM> key on Sun keyboards) or any
	   key/button defined in the translation table for the
	   canvas.  See the default <STRONG>Fig.ad</STRONG> file for example.  Text
	   is drawn using the current font, font size and
	   justification settings.  A DEL or ^H (backspace) will
	   delete a character, while a ^X will erase the entire
	   line.  Finish by clicking mouse button 2 or typing the
	   &lt;<EM>return</EM>&gt; key.  If &lt;<EM>return</EM>&gt; is used, the text pointer
	   automatically moves to the next ``line'', a distance of
	   the font height times the value in the <EM>TEXT</EM> <EM>STEP</EM>
	   button, and text input mode is re-entered.  To finish
	   text fully, click mouse button 2 or choose any panel
	   button that changes modes (e.g. box, save, etc).  To
	   edit text, click on an existing text string with mouse
	   button 1.  Insertion of characters will take place at
	   that point.  Or, use the popup <EM>EDIT</EM> mode to modify the
	   text.

	   Eight-bit characters may be entered using the meta
	   (compose) key.  For example, to create an ``a umlaut'',
	   press and release the meta key, then the letter ``a'',
	   then " (quote).  To create a ``c cedilla'', use &lt;meta&gt;c
	   followed by comma.  The following is a list of all
	   special characters available using the meta key:

<STRONG>EDITING</STRONG> <STRONG>MODE</STRONG> <STRONG>PANEL</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMAND</STRONG> <STRONG>DESCRIPTIONS</STRONG>
  When a button in the editing mode panel is pressed, any
  objects that may be affected by that editing operation will
  show their corner markers.  Only those objects may be
  affected by the particular edit mode.  In cases where two
  edit modes exist for one button, it may be that the corner
  markers will appear for objects that may be affected by one
  button but not the other.

<STRONG>SELECTING</STRONG> <STRONG>OBJECTS</STRONG>
  When multiple objects have points in common, e.g. two boxes
  that touch at one corner, only one object can be selected by
  clicking on that point.  To select other objects, hold down
  the shift key while pressing mouse button 1: the markers of
  one object will be temporarily highlighted.  By repeatedly
  clicking mouse button 1 while holding down the shift key, it
  is possible to cycle through all candidates for selection at
  that point.  To perform the selected action, e.g.  deleting
  one box, click on the point without holding down the shift
  key.  The operation will be performed on the highlighted
  object.

  <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> If the mouse is not clicked near enough to an object
  marker or for whatever reason <EM>xfig</EM> cannot ``find'' the
  object the user is trying to select, a black square will
  temporarily appear above the mouse cursor.
  <EM>GLUE</EM> <EM>COMPOUND</EM>
	   Compound objects are created by first tagging the
	   objects to be compounded and then pressing mouse button
	   3 to group the tagged objects into a compound object.
	   Single objects are tagged by clicking on them with
	   mouse button 1.  A number of objects can be tagged at
	   once by using mouse button 2 to define the upper-left
	   and lower-right corners of a region enclosing the
	   objects.  Tagged objects are shown with highlighted
	   markers.  Tagged objects which are selected (see the
	   <STRONG>SELECTING</STRONG> <STRONG>OBJECTS</STRONG> section above) will be temporarily
	   unhighlighted.  There is currently no special command
	   to tag or untag all of the objects within a figure.
	   You can untag all of the objects by changing from <EM>GLUE</EM>
	   mode to some other mode (apart from <EM>BREAK)</EM> and back
	   again.

  <EM>BREAK</EM> <EM>COMPOUND</EM>
	   Break a compound object to allow manipulation of its
	   component parts.  Click mouse button 1 on one of the
	   corner markers of the compound object or along one of
	   the imaginary lines defining the compound box.
	   Clicking with mouse button 2 will achieve the same
	   effect but will also tag the component parts (although
	   you will not see the tags until you change to the <EM>GLUE</EM>
	   mode).  You can use this feature to easily alter the
	   objects within a compound.

  <EM>SCALE</EM> <EM>OBJECT</EM>
	   Any object may be scaled.  If mouse button 1 is pressed
	   on any corner of a <EM>BOX</EM> or <EM>ARC</EM>-<EM>BOX</EM> object, then that
	   object will be scaled proportionally to its aspect
	   ratio.  If pressed on an edge then that dimension will
	   be scaled.  For other objects only mouse button 2 may
	   be used for scaling; said object will be scaled larger
	   or smaller about its center.  Mouse button 2 may be
	   used on boxes too.  Text may only be scaled if inside a
	   compound object and then only if its <EM>RIGID</EM> flag is set
	   to <EM>NORMAL</EM> (using the popup edit panel).  See the
	   <EM>TransFig</EM> manual for description of text options.

  <EM>ALIGN</EM>
	   Align objects.  Click mouse button 1 to align objects
	   inside a compound object or mouse button 2 to align all
	   objects on canvas according to the setting in the
	   <EM>VERTICAL</EM> <EM>ALIGN</EM> and <EM>HORIZONTAL</EM> <EM>ALIGN</EM> indicators.  Note
	   that alignment with respect to the canvas doesn't work
	   for distributing or abutting.  The choices are the
	   cumulative effect of vertically aligning the objects to
	   the <EM>TOP</EM>, <EM>MIDDLE</EM> or <EM>BOTTOM</EM> edge and horizontally
	   aligning to the <EM>LEFT</EM>, <EM>MIDDLE</EM> or <EM>RIGHT</EM> edge of the
	   compound, along with distributing or abutting the
	   objects vertically or horizontally.

  <EM>MOVE</EM> <EM>POINT</EM>
	   Modify the position of a point of any object except
	   <EM>TEXT</EM> and <EM>COMPOUND</EM> objects.  For unrestrained movement,
	   click mouse button 1 over the desired point, reposition
	   the point, and click the <EM>left</EM> button again.  For
	   horizontally or vertically constrained move, click
	   mouse button 2 on the desired point and move either
	   horizontally or vertically.  Notice that once you
	   choose the direction (horizontal or vertical), movement
	   is constrained in that direction.  If, after moving the
	   mouse initially, it is moved in the other direction a
	   greater distance than the current position of the mouse
	   relative to the starting point, then that will be the
	   new constraint direction.  In other words if you first
	   move the mouse <EM>horizontally</EM> one inch (say) then move it
	   <EM>vertically</EM> 1.3 inches, the direction will switch to
	   <EM>vertical</EM> until any <EM>horizontal</EM> motion exceeds 1.3
	   inches.  When the object is positioned where desired,
	   click mouse button 1 to place it if that button was
	   used to start the move (unconstrained), or mouse button
	   2 (constrained) if that button was used.

  <EM>MOVE</EM> Move object.  Click mouse button 1 (unconstrained move)
	   or mouse button 2 (constrained move) on any corner
	   marker of the object to be moved.  The
	   horizontal/vertical constrained movement (mouse button
	   2) works exactly as described for <EM>MOVE</EM> <EM>POINT</EM>.

  <EM>ADD</EM> <EM>POINTS</EM>
	   Add points to <EM>POLYLINE</EM>, <EM>POLYGON</EM>, <EM>SPLINE</EM>, or <EM>CLOSED</EM>
	   <EM>SPLINE</EM> objects (points of a <EM>BOX</EM> can not be added or
	   deleted).  Note that a <EM>REGULAR</EM> <EM>POLYGON</EM> is really an
	   ordinary <EM>POLYGON</EM>, so adding points to this object is
	   allowed and does NOT keep the polygon regular.

  <EM>COPY</EM> / <EM>CUT</EM> <EM>TO</EM> <EM>CUT</EM> <EM>BUFFER</EM>
	   Copy object to canvas or cut buffer.  Click mouse
	   button 1 (unconstrained copy) or mouse button 2
	   (constrained copy) on any corner marker of the object
	   to be copied (for <EM>CIRCLE</EM> and <EM>ELLIPSE</EM> objects, mouse may
	   also be clicked on their circumferences).  The object
	   will be duplicated and then moved exactly as in <EM>MOVE</EM>.

	   If the number of X or Y copies is non-zero (from the
	   bottom panel) then that many copies will be made in
	   each respective direction, spaced evenly by the amount
	   of the distance the object is placed from the original
	   object.

	   If mouse button 3 is clicked on an object, that object
	   is copied to the cut buffer for pasting into this or
	   another figure.  The file used for the cut buffer is
	   called <STRONG>.xfig</STRONG> in the user's $<EM>HOME</EM> directory.  This
	   allows a user to run two or more <EM>xfig</EM> processes and
	   cut/paste objects between them.  If there is no $<EM>HOME</EM>,
	   a file is created in a temporary directory called
	   <STRONG>xfig</STRONG><EM>PID</EM> where <EM>PID</EM> is the <EM>xfig</EM> process ID.  The
	   temporary directory used is specified in the
	   environment variable <EM>XFIGTMPDIR</EM>.  If that variable is
	   empty or not set then <STRONG>/tmp</STRONG> is used.

  <EM>DELETE</EM> <EM>POINTS</EM>
	   Delete points from <EM>POLYLINE</EM>, <EM>POLYGON</EM>, <EM>SPLINE</EM>, or <EM>CLOSED</EM>
	   <EM>SPLINE</EM>.  Objects (points of a <EM>BOX</EM> or <EM>ARC</EM>-<EM>BOX</EM> can not be
	   added or deleted).  Note that a <EM>REGULAR</EM> <EM>POLYGON</EM> is
	   really an ordinary <EM>POLYGON</EM>, so deleting points from
	   this object is allowed and does NOT keep the polygon
	   regular.

  <EM>DELETE</EM>
	   Click mouse button 1 on an object to delete the object.
	   Delete a <EM>region</EM> of the canvas by clicking mouse button
	   2 and dragging the mouse to define an area of objects
	   to delete.  Clicking mouse button 3 on an object will
	   copy the object to the cut buffer (see <EM>COPY</EM>/<EM>CUT</EM> <EM>TO</EM> <EM>CUT</EM>
	   <EM>BUFFER</EM> above).

  <EM>EDIT</EM> <EM>OBJECT</EM>
	   Edit settings for an existing object.  Click mouse
	   button 1 on the object and a pop-up menu will appear
	   showing existing settings for the object.  Some of the
	   menu entries may be changed by typing new values in the
	   appropriate windows.  These are editable Ascii-
	   TextWidgets and allow cut and paste.  Others pop up a
	   sub-menu of multiple choices when pressed and held.
	   Yet others are buttons which toggle a setting on or off
	   (e.g. arrow heads on lines).

	   Press the ``done'' button to apply the changes to the
	   object and finish.  Press the ``apply'' button to apply
	   the changes but keep the menu up for further changes.
	   Press the ``cancel'' button to cancel the changes and
	   pop down the menu.

	   The following table shows which settings are used for
	   the different objects.

	   * Encapsulated PostScript picture objects don't use any
	   of the above attributes.  The PostScript image is
	   self-defined.  However, X11 bitmap picture objects use
	   the pen color for coloring the bitmap image.

  <EM>UPDATE</EM>
	   By pressing mouse button 1 on an object, the current
	   settings for the indicator buttons (line width, line
	   style, area fill etc.) which have been selected for
	   update are copied into that object.  When <EM>xfig</EM> is
	   started, all indicator buttons which are components of
	   objects are selected for update.  To unselect an
	   indicator, click on the update button and click mouse
	   button 1 on the small button in the upper-right corner
	   of the indicator.  When that indicator is selected the
	   foreground color (default black) shows.  When it is
	   unselected the background color (default white) shows.

	   If mouse button 2 is clicked on an object, the settings
	   in the object that are selected by the indicator
	   buttons are copied into those indicator button
	   settings.  Thus, one may copy selected attributes of
	   one object to another.

  <EM>FLIP</EM> <EM>VERTICALLY</EM>
	   Flip the object up/down (mouse button 1) or copy the
	   object and flip it (mouse button 2).  Point to part of
	   the object, click the appropriate button.  That object
	   will be flipped vertically about that point.

	   Optionally, mouse button 3 may be pressed on the canvas
	   to set an anchor point about which the object will be
	   flipped.  A crosshair indicates the anchor point on the
	   canvas.  Pressing this button again will unset the
	   anchor point.

  <EM>FLIP</EM> <EM>HORIZONTALLY</EM>
	   Flip the object left/right (mouse button 1) or copy the
	   object and flip it (mouse button 2).  Point to part of
	   the object, click the appropriate button.  That object
	   will be flipped horizontally about that point.

	   Optionally, mouse button 3 may be pressed on the canvas
	   to set an anchor point about which the object will be
	   flipped.  A crosshair indicates the anchor point on the
	   canvas.  Pressing this button again will unset the
	   anchor point.

  <EM>ROTATE</EM> <EM>CLOCKWISE</EM>
	   Rotate the object (mouse button 1) or copy and rotate
	   it (mouse button 2) -<STRONG>N</STRONG> degrees (clockwise), where <STRONG>N</STRONG> is
	   the amount set in the rotation indicator button.  The
	   object is rotated about the chosen point.

	   Optionally, mouse button 3 may be pressed on the canvas
	   to set a rotation point about which the object will be
	   rotated.  A crosshair indicates the rotation point on
	   the canvas.  Pressing this button again will unset the
	   rotation point.

	   Not all objects can be rotated, and not all can be
	   rotated at arbitrary angles.  For example, <EM>BOX</EM>, <EM>ARC</EM>-<EM>BOX</EM>
	   and <EM>PIC</EM> objects may only be rotated by 90 degrees.
	   Text objects may be rotated and to any angle.

  <EM>ROTATE</EM> <EM>COUNTER</EM>-<EM>CLOCKWISE</EM>
	   Rotate the object (mouse button 1) or copy (mouse
	   button 2) +<STRONG>N</STRONG> degrees (counter-clockwise), where <STRONG>N</STRONG> is
	   the amount set in the rotation indicator button.  The
	   object is rotated about the chosen point.

	   Optionally, mouse button 3 may be pressed on the canvas
	   to set a rotation point about which the object will be
	   rotated.  A crosshair indicates the rotation point on
	   the canvas.  Pressing this button again will unset the
	   rotation point.

  <EM>SPLINE</EM> &lt;-&gt; <EM>POLYLINE</EM>
	   and
7

	   Turn a <EM>POLYGON</EM> into a <EM>CLOSED</EM> <EM>INTERPOLATED</EM> <EM>SPLINE</EM> , turn
	   a <EM>POLYLINE</EM> into a <EM>INTERPOLATED</EM> <EM>SPLINE</EM> or turn a <EM>BOX</EM>
	   into a ARC-BOX or vice versa.

  <EM>ADD</EM>/<EM>DELETE</EM> <EM>ARROWS</EM>
	   Add or delete arrow heads of <EM>OPEN</EM> <EM>ARC</EM>, <EM>POLYLINE</EM> or
	   <EM>SPLINE</EM> objects.  Add an arrow head by clicking mouse
	   button 1 on the endpoint of the object.  Delete an
	   arrow head by clicking mouse button 2 on the endpoint
	   or arrow head.  The length and thickness of the
	   arrowheads may be modified using the popup edit panel.

<STRONG>PANNING</STRONG>
  The figure may be panned by clicking mouse button 1, 2 or 3
  in the rulers.  Clicking mouse button 1 in the top ruler
  will pan the image to the left by 1/2 inch (1cm in metric
  mode), adjusted for zoom factor.  Clicking mouse button 3 in
  the top ruler will pan the image right by the same amount.
  By pressing and <EM>holding</EM> mouse button 2 the user may drag the
  ruler by the amount desired, thus panning the image by that
  amount.

  If the Shift key is held down while panning the movement is
  five (5) times the normal rate.

  The figure is panned up and down in the same way by clicking
  the mouse in the ruler on the right of the canvas.

  If the Shift key is held down while panning the movement is
  five (5) times the normal rate.

  The figure can be returned to its origin by clicking mouse
  button 1 in the units (e.g.  <EM>cm</EM> or <EM>in)</EM> box.

  The arrow keys may also be used to pan the image and the
  home key to return the figure to the origin.  Also, pressing
  the Control Key and mouse button 2 will pan the figure to
  the origin.

<STRONG>BUGS</STRONG> <STRONG>and</STRONG> <STRONG>RESTRICTIONS</STRONG>
  Please send bug reports, fixes, new features etc. to:
  bvsmith@lbl.gov (Brian V. Smith)

  Because of the difference of some fonts in some X servers
  and the PostScript fonts on printers, text alignment can be
  problematic.

  Not all operations employ smart redrawing of objects which
  are altered as a by product of the operation.  You may need
  to use <EM>Redraw</EM> in these cases.

  Some servers do not allow bitmaps/pixmaps taller than the
  screen height or wider than the screen width.  That is why
  there is a limit on the width of the top ruler and height of
  the side ruler.  If you need wider/taller rulers AND your
  server allows bigger pixmaps, you may define <STRONG>MAX_TOPRULER_WD</STRONG>
  and/or <STRONG>MAX_SIDERULER_HT</STRONG> in your Imakefile in the <EM>DEFINES</EM>
  line.  For example, to have a maximum top ruler width of
  1160 pixels, add <STRONG>-DMAX_TOPRULER_WD=1160</STRONG> to your <EM>DEFINES</EM> line
  in the Imakefile.

  If the image is panned or the <EM>xfig</EM> window iconified and de-
  iconified during the middle of an operation (e.g. while
  drawing a line), the picture will be distorted.  This can be
  corrected using <EM>Redraw</EM> after the operation is complete.

  Corners of object scaled with point positioning in one of
  the grid modes will not always fall on the grid line, but to
  the closest pixel.

  When zoomed very large, the length of dashes in dashed lines
  will top out at 255 pixels long.  This is due to a
  restriction in X that the dash list is defined by char (255
  pixels maximum for a dash).  The figure will print
  correctly, however.

  See the <STRONG>README</STRONG> file for troubleshooting.

  <STRONG>Version</STRONG> <STRONG>3.1:</STRONG>


	  The only difference between protocol version 3.0 and
	  version 3.1 is that the position of the "magnet" has
	  been shifted by 14 fig units.  In the 2.1 and older
	  versions of xfig the grid was in multiples of 5 fig
	  units, but they were on intervals 4, 9, 14, 19, etc.
	  When version 3.0 was created, coordinates were simply
	  multiplied by the ratio of the resolutions (1200/80 =
	  15) so values like 4 became 60 instead of 74 ((4+1)*15 -
	  1).

	  The JPEG import/export code uses the Independent JPEG
	  Group software (see jpeg/README for details)

	  Image browser, editor and screen capture features by:
	  Jim Daley (jdaley@cix.compulink.co.uk)
