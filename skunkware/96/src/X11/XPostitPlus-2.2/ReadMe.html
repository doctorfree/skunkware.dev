<STRONG>NAME</STRONG>
  xpostit - X window system Post-it(r) notes

<STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>
  <STRONG>xpostit</STRONG> [ -<EM>toolkitoptions</EM> ... ] [ -<EM>options</EM> ... ]

<STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
  <EM>Xpostit</EM> provides a mechanism for manipulating on-screen
  Post-it(r) notes.  All six sizes of Post-it notes may be
  displayed, edited, and saved to disk files.  In addition,
  any on-screen note may be resized to any arbitrary size
  either when it is created or at a later time.

  All notes can be "hidden" - the notes are still available
  but not shown on the screen until requested by the user.
  Hidden notes will stay hidden when xpostit is exited and
  then restarted (as long as the user saves all notes before
  exiting).

  When <EM>xpostit</EM> is first invoked, it creates a small window
  with a plaid background.  This is the control window for
  <EM>xpostit</EM>.  Additionally, if any notes were stored in the save
  directory (see below), these will be placed on the screen at
  their last locations, unless they were hidden when saved
  (see below).  Each Post-it note, when created, makes another
  window on the screen.  <EM>Xpostit</EM> is controlled using the mouse
  buttons and a menu.  The Post-it notes are controlled by
  using a drop down menu.

<STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
  <EM>Xpostit</EM> accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line
  options along with the additional options listed below.

  <STRONG>-bs</STRONG> <EM>number</EM>
		  Specifies the size of the character buffer in which
		  to save each Post-it note.  A note may not contain
		  more than this number of characters, including
		  newlines.  The default is 1024.

  <STRONG>-nw</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
		  Allows the user to specify the width, in pixels, for
		  a single character of text.  This is dependent on
		  the font being used, but the Athena Widget set and
		  the Xt Intrinsics apparently doesn't allow a program
		  to determine this value at run time.  This value is
		  used to determine the width of the Name dialog box,
		  which is used to provide a title for a given note.
		  The default value for this option is 10 pixels.

  <STRONG>-ao</STRONG> <EM>offset</EM>
		  The offset is specified in pixels and is used to
		  determine the X and Y offsets from an anchor note
		  for a note being cascaded.  The default value is 15
		  pixels.

  <STRONG>-dir</STRONG> <EM>path</EM>
		  Specifies the path name of the directory in which to
		  store saved Post-it notes.  If <EM>path</EM> begins with a
		  `/' it is taken as-is; if it does not begin with a
		  `/', the path is taken relative to the home
		  directory.  If the named directory does not already
		  exist, then <EM>xpostit</EM> attempts to create it.  The
		  default is .<EM>postitnotes</EM>.

  <STRONG>-tmpdir</STRONG> <EM>path</EM>
		  Specifies the path name of the directory to use for
		  temporary files.  By default ``/tmp'' is used.

  <STRONG>-printcmd</STRONG> <EM>cmd</EM>
		  This must be a quoted command string that can be
		  used as the format string to sprintf().  It must
		  include "%s" for the temporary file name used when
		  printing a note.  The buffer created with sprintf(),
		  this option value, and the temporary file name is
		  passed to the system() call to print the note.  By
		  default, the printcmd value is ``lpr %s''.

  <STRONG>-calendarcmd</STRONG> <EM>cmd</EM>
		  This is the command used to produce a calendar for
		  the current month.  On most Unix systems this will
		  be ``cal'', which is the default.  The output from
		  this command is redirected to a temporary file and
		  then inserted into a note at the current cursor
		  location.

  <STRONG>-emailcmd</STRONG> <EM>cmd</EM>
		  The "Email" option from the notes menu will pop up a
		  window prompting for an email address.  The
		  -emailcmd command line option or .emailCmd resource
		  can be set to your systems mailer command.  The
		  mailer must accept the text of the mail via standard
		  input (actually as a pipe from "cat tmpfile").
		  "cmd" must be a Unix style command in printf()
		  format.  See the section on <EM>Configuring</EM> <EM>the</EM> <EM>mailer</EM>.

  <STRONG>-sb</STRONG>     Enables scroll-bars.  If specified, a scroll bar
		  will be attached to each Post-it note.

  <STRONG>-sv</STRONG>     Enables save-on-exit.  When specified, this option
		  tells <EM>xpostit</EM> to save all Post-it notes to disk
		  files when exiting.  If not specified, notes can be
		  saved to disk files manually by the user or via the
		  autosave feature.  It is useful to specify this
		  option since hidden notes cannot be saved unless
		  either the "Save All Notes" option is used or the
		  autosave option has not been disabled.  Its also to
		  use this option since its not guaranteed that the
		  autosave feature will have saved all notes since
		  their last updates when xpostit exits.

  <STRONG>-c</STRONG>      Enables compatibility mode.  Initially this is for
		  notes created using the %! magic cookie.  In version
		  2.2 this was changed to %%!! because the original
		  cookie was the one being used for Postscript files.
		  In the future this mode may cover other items that
		  are not compatible between versions/releases.

  <STRONG>-ns</STRONG>     Disables the autosave feature.

  <STRONG>-na</STRONG>     Disables alarms.

  <STRONG>-interval</STRONG>
		  Sets the timeout interval (in seconds) for when the
		  autosave timeout should expire.  When this timer
		  expires, all notes are automatically saved to disk.
		  The default value is 10 minutes.

  <STRONG>-help</STRONG>   Displays a usage message.

<STRONG>WIDGET</STRONG> <STRONG>USAGE</STRONG>
  <EM>Xpostit</EM> uses several widget types to construct the objects
  it uses.

  The control window is a Plaid widget called ``Plaid''.  This
  is a widget designed by David A. Curry, the original author
  of <EM>xpostit</EM>.

  The menu is a pop-up shell called ``Menu'' containing a
  SimpleMenu widget.  From this menu the hidden notes menu can
  be popped up.  The hidden notes menu is also a SimpleMenu
  widget.

  Each Post-it note is a pop-up shell called ``PostItNote'',
  containing a Form widget called ``Note'' which contains a
  Text widget called ``NoteText'', and a MenuButton widget
  called "Options".  The Options button, when selected, pops
  up a drop-down menu called "OptionsMenu" (see the Xpostit.ad
  application defaults file).  Inside of this menu are five
  menu items called ``Save'', ``Erase'', ``Destroy'',
  ``Hide'', and ``Name''.

  The confirmation box is a pop-up shell called ``Confirm'',
  containing a Form widget called ``Buttons'' which contains
  two Command widgets called ``Confirm'' and ``Cancel''.
  There is also dialog box which pops up when the Name menu
  item is selected which is called "Dialog".

<STRONG>RESOURCES</STRONG>
  <EM>Xpostit</EM> understands all of the core X Toolkit resource names
  and classes as well as those listed below, which are all of
  class <STRONG>Xpostit</STRONG>.

  <STRONG>.bufSize</STRONG>
		  Specifies the size of the character buffer used to
		  store a Post-it note.  The default is 1024.

  <STRONG>.nameWidth</STRONG>
		  See the -nw command line option.  The default value
		  for this resource is 10.

  <STRONG>.noteDir</STRONG>
		  Specifies the path name of the directory in which to
		  store saved notes.  The default is .<EM>postitnotes</EM>.

  <STRONG>.tmpDir</STRONG> Specifies the path name of the directory to use for
		  temporary files.  By default ``/tmp'' is used.

  <STRONG>.printCmd</STRONG>
		  This must be a quoted command string that can be
		  used as the format string to sprintf().  It must
		  include "%s" for the temporary file name used when
		  printing a note.  The buffer created with sprintf(),
		  this option value, and the temporary file name is
		  passed to the system() call to print the note.  By
		  default, the printcmd value is ``lpr %s''.

  <STRONG>.calendarCmd</STRONG>
		  This is the command used to produce a calendar for
		  the current month.  On most Unix systems this will
		  be ``cal'', which is the default.  The output from
		  this command is redirected to a temporary file and
		  then inserted into a note at the current cursor
		  location.

  <STRONG>.emailCmd</STRONG>
		  The "Email" option from the notes menu will pop up a
		  window prompting for an email address.  The
		  -emailcmd command line option or .emailCmd resource
		  can be set to your systems mailer command.  The
		  mailer must accept the text of the mail via standard
		  input (actually as a pipe from "cat tmpfile").
		  "cmd" must be a Unix style command in printf()
		  format.  See the section on <EM>Configuring</EM> <EM>the</EM> <EM>mailer</EM>.

  <STRONG>.saveNotes</STRONG>
		  Controls the state of the save-on-exit option.  The
		  default is <STRONG>false</STRONG>.

  <STRONG>.scrollBar</STRONG>
		  Controls placing scroll bars on Post-it notes.  The
		  default is <STRONG>false</STRONG>.

  <STRONG>.compatibility</STRONG>
		  Enables compatibility mode.  This shouldn't really
		  be set in the app-defaults file.  If you wish to use
		  this feature, use the -c option.

  <STRONG>.interval</STRONG>
		  Sets the timeout interval (in seconds) for when the
		  autosave timeout should expire.  When this timer
		  expires, all notes are automatically saved to disk.

  <STRONG>.anchorOffset</STRONG>
		  The offset is specified in pixels and is used to
		  determine the X and Y offsets from an anchor note
		  for a note being cascaded.  The default value is 15
		  pixels.

  <STRONG>.noSave</STRONG> If set to true then the auto-save feature is turned
		  off.

  <STRONG>.noAlarm</STRONG>
		  If set to true then the alarms feature is turned
		  off.  This will have the effect of graying out the
		  ``Set Alarm'' and ``Unset Alarm'' options from each
		  Notes pull down menu.

<STRONG>ACTIONS</STRONG>
  It is possible to rebind the mouse buttons in the Plaid
  widget to perform different functions by changing the
  widget's translations.  It is not recommended that other
  actions (as specified in the application defaults file) be
  changed, however.  The <EM>raise</EM>() action, normally bound to the
  left mouse button, raises all notes.  The <EM>lower</EM>() action,
  normally bound to the middle mouse button, lowers all notes.
  The menu raising function, normally bound to the right mouse
  button, is performed by calling the actions
  <EM>XawPositionSimpleMenu(Menu)</EM> and <EM>MenuPopup(Menu)</EM>.

  This can now be configured by changing the following lines
  in the Xpostit.ad file:

  Xpostit*Plaid.Translations: #replace\n \
	 &lt;Btn1Down&gt;: raise()  \n\
	 &lt;Btn2Down&gt;: lower()  \n\
	 &lt;Btn3Down&gt;: XawPositionSimpleMenu(Menu) MenuPopup(Menu)

  to the following:

  Xpostit*Plaid.Translations: #replace\n \
	 &lt;Btn3Down&gt;: raise()  \n\
	 &lt;Btn2Down&gt;: lower()  \n\
	 &lt;Btn1Down&gt;: XawPositionSimpleMenu(Menu) MenuPopup(Menu)

<STRONG>THE</STRONG> <STRONG>CONTROL</STRONG> <STRONG>WINDOW</STRONG>
  <EM>Xpostit</EM> allows three operations to be performed from its
  control window.  Pressing the left mouse button in the
  control window will cause all Post-it notes on the screen to
  be raised to the top.  Pressing the middle mouse button in
  the control window will cause all Post-it notes on the
  screen to be lowered to the bottom.  Pressing the right
  mouse button in the control window raises the <EM>xpostit</EM> menu.

<STRONG>THE</STRONG> <STRONG>PLAID</STRONG> <STRONG>MENU</STRONG>
  The <EM>xpostit</EM> plaid menu provides the following selections:

  <STRONG>Create</STRONG> <STRONG>1.5x2</STRONG> <STRONG>Note</STRONG>
		  Create a new Post-it note, 1.5 inches tall by 2
		  inches wide.  The window will normally need to be
		  positioned using the window manager.

  <STRONG>Create</STRONG> <STRONG>2x3</STRONG> <STRONG>Note</STRONG>
		  Create a new Post-it note, 2 inches tall by 3 inches
		  wide.

  <STRONG>Create</STRONG> <STRONG>3x3</STRONG> <STRONG>Note</STRONG>
		  Create a new Post-it note, 3 inches square.

  <STRONG>Create</STRONG> <STRONG>3x4</STRONG> <STRONG>Note</STRONG>
		  Create a new Post-it note, 3 inches tall by 4 inches
		  wide.

  <STRONG>Create</STRONG> <STRONG>3x5</STRONG> <STRONG>Note</STRONG>
		  Create a new Post-it note, 3 inches tall by 5 inches
		  wide.

  <STRONG>Create</STRONG> <STRONG>4x6</STRONG> <STRONG>Note</STRONG>
		  Create a new Post-it note, 4 inches tall by 6 inches
		  wide.

  <STRONG>Raise</STRONG> <STRONG>All</STRONG> <STRONG>Notes</STRONG>
		  Raise all Post-it notes to the top.  This is
		  equivalent to pressing the left mouse button in the
		  control window.

  <STRONG>Lower</STRONG> <STRONG>All</STRONG> <STRONG>Notes</STRONG>
		  Lower all Post-it notes to the bottom.  This is
		  equivalent to pressing the middle mouse button in
		  the control window.

  <STRONG>Unhide</STRONG> <STRONG>All</STRONG> <STRONG>Notes</STRONG>
		  All notes that have been hidden will be unhidden.

  <STRONG>Save</STRONG> <STRONG>All</STRONG> <STRONG>Notes</STRONG>
		  Save all Post-it notes to disk files in the save
		  directory.

  <STRONG>Hidden</STRONG> <STRONG>Notes</STRONG>
		  Pops up another menu which lists all the notes that
		  are currently hidden.  The list contains the names
		  of the notes so it is wise to give a note a
		  meaningful name (using the Name option from the
		  pull-down menu of each note) before it is hidden.

  <STRONG>Cascade</STRONG> <STRONG>Notes</STRONG>
		  Each note can be "anchored".  If one or more notes
		  are anchored and the "Cascade" option is chosen from
		  the xpostit menu, then all the visible notes are
		  cascaded onto the anchored notes.  An attempt is
		  made to distribute all visible notes evenly amongst
		  all the anchored notes.  Each note also has an
		  "unanchor" option as well.  Only one of "anchor" or
		  "unanchor" is sensitive for any given note.  Hidden
		  notes are not affected by the cascade feature.  The
		  default offset for cascaded notes (from the anchor)
		  is 15 pixels.  This can be changed with the -ao
		  option or the .anchorOffset resource.

  <STRONG>Find</STRONG> <STRONG>A</STRONG> <STRONG>Note</STRONG>
		  If you "lose" a note and want to bring it up at the
		  cursor, select ``Find A Note'' from the plaid menu.
		  A pop up window of all notes will be presented.
		  Select the note you want and if its not hidden it
		  will pop up at the cursor.  If it is hidden it will
		  pop up in the appropriate spot.  The ``Cancel''
		  button will close the pop up if no note is selected.

  <STRONG>Exit</STRONG>    Exit <EM>xpostit</EM>. If the <STRONG>-sv</STRONG> command line option was
		  given, or the <STRONG>saveNotes</STRONG> resource is <STRONG>true,</STRONG> all Post-
		  it notes will be saved to disk first.

  To select an item from the menu, drag the mouse cursor to
  that item and release the mouse button.

<STRONG>THE</STRONG> <STRONG>HIDDEN</STRONG> <STRONG>NOTES</STRONG> <STRONG>MENU</STRONG>
  This menu pops up from the ``Hidden Notes'' option of the
  plaid menu.  It functions the same as the plaid menu except
  the menu does not disappear until either a menu option is
  selected or the label (at the top of the menu) is clicked
  on.

<STRONG>THE</STRONG> <STRONG>POST-IT</STRONG> <STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>
  Each Post-it note is made up of three parts (plus an
  optional scroll bar): a Title bar, a text window where the
  text of the note is stored, and an Options pull-down menu.
  To enter text into a Post-it note, simply move the mouse
  cursor into the text window and start typing.  Since the
  text window is actually a Text widget, all the Text widget
  translations are accepted.  Essentially, this means you can
  use most of the EMACS control keys in the window.
  Additionally, the various mouse buttons used for
  manipulating the selections and cut buffer are understood.

  After entering text in the Post-it note, you may wish to
  save the note in a disk file.  This way, if the machine goes
  down, or if you exit <EM>xpostit</EM>, the Post-it note can be
  restored when you restart <EM>xpostit</EM>.  (Post-it notes are also
  saved automatically (if <STRONG>saveNotes</STRONG> is true) if a SIGHUP,
  SIGINT, SIGTERM, or SIGQUIT signal is received.) To save the
  note to a disk file, click on the Options button and drag
  the mouse cursor to the menu item labeled ``Save'', then
  release the mouse button.  The note will be saved as the
  file ``note<STRONG>n</STRONG>'' in your save directory, where <STRONG>n</STRONG> is some
  sequence number.  Note that the ``Save'' menu item will not
  allow you to save unless something have been typed in the
  Text of the note, the name of the note has been changed, or
  the text of the note has been erased.  This is a good way
  for checking if you've made changes to the note.  If the
  Save menu item is "insensitive" (grayed-out) then you
  haven't made any changes to the Text of the note.  <STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: it
  is important to remember that until you have pressed the
  ``Save'' button, any changed data in the Post-it note is not
  saved on disk and can be lost if the system goes down or
  <EM>xpostit</EM> exits.

  To erase the entire contents of the text window, you can
  click on the Options button and select the ``Erase'' menu
  item.  This will bring up a confirmation window, which has
  two buttons labeled ``Confirm'' and ``Cancel''.  If you
  press the ``Confirm'' button, the text will be erased.  If
  you press the ``Cancel'' button, the operation is canceled,
  and nothing will happen.  <STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: erasing the text in the
  window does not affect any contents of the note you have
  saved on disk unless you press the ``Save'' button again.

  To destroy a Post-it note, getting rid of its window on the
  screen and the disk file it is saved in, click on the
  Options button and select the ``Destroy'' menu item.  This
  will bring up a confirmation window as described above.  If
  you confirm the operation, the Post-it note will disappear
  from the screen and the disk file it was saved in will be
  deleted.

  To rename a note, you can click on the Options button and
  select the ``Name'' menu item.  This will bring up a dialog
  box, which has two buttons labeled ``Confirm'' and
  ``Cancel'' as well as a field to enter text for the new
  name.  If you press the ``Confirm'' button, the new name
  will be placed in the title bar of the note.  If you press
  the ``Cancel'' button, the operation is canceled.

  To hide a note, you can click on the Options button and
  select the ``Hide'' menu item.  This will cause the note to
  disappear from the screen.  To bring the note back, select
  the ``Hidden Notes'' option from the plaid pull-down menu.
  Then select the note you wish to bring back up.  <STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: The
  hidden notes will not stay hidden between <EM>xpostit</EM> sessions
  unless you first select the "Save All Notes" option from the
  plaid menu or options to save on exit (see discussion above)
  have been set.

  To anchor a note you can click on the Options button and
  select the ``Anchor'' menu item.  This will mark the note as
  an anchor note.  Anchor notes are the bottom note, the
  "anchor", when the Cascade option is chosen from the xpostit
  menu.

  To unanchor a note you can click on the Options button and
  select the ``UnAnchor'' menu item.  This will remove the
  note from the list of anchor notes.

  Note that only one of the ``Anchor'' or ``UnAnchor'' options
  will be sensitive (allow user selection) at any time.  They
  are mutually exclusive options.

  To print a note, you must have configured xpostit with a
  valid print command (via the -printcmd command line option
  or the .printCmd resource).  Select the ``Print'' option
  from a notes pull down menu.  The text of the note is
  printed.

  To email a note use the ``Email'' option.  This option from
  will pop up a window prompting for an email address. Fill in
  the text field and select ``Accept'' to send the message.
  The notes title will be used as the subject line.  Select
  ``Cancel'' to cancel sending the message.

  To set a notes alarm, select ``Set Alarm'' from the notes
  Options pull down menu.  A window pops up with month, day,
  hour and minute fields.  Set each of these for the day and
  time you wish the alarm to go off.  If you wish to save this
  value between invokations you should use either the notes
  ``Save'' option or the ``Save All Notes'' option from the
  plaid windows menu.  When a notes alarm is set an icon of a
  clock will be visible next to the Options menu button in the
  notes menu bar.

  To turn off the a notes alarm, select ``Unset Alarm'' from
  the Options pull down menu.  This will disable the alarm for
  that note and remove the clock icon from the menu bar.

  To insert a copy of the current calendar month in the text
  select the "Insert Calendar" option from the notes menu.
  The text will be inserted at the current cursor location, so
  you should be sure to position the cursor first.  You can
  position the cursor by just clicking in the text window of
  the note.

<STRONG>CONFIGURING</STRONG> <STRONG>THE</STRONG> <STRONG>MAILER</STRONG>
  In order to use your systems mailer with the Email feature
  of xpostit, you need to configure the appropriate mailer
  command using either the -emailcmd command line option or
  the .emailCmd resource.   The format for both of these is
  the same:  a double-quoted string which contains the name of
  the mailer command, the option for providing the subject
  line, and the addressee.  By default the Unix command "mail"
  is used.  It is defined in the Xpostit.ad (and in the source
  code fallback resources) as:


			"mail -s\"%s\" %s"


  The format is the standard format used by printf().  The
  first string parameter is the subject line.   The
  backslashes are required so that the following double quotes
  are passed properly to the shell.  If these are left out the
  subject will be truncated to the first word of the first
  string parameter and an attempt will be made by the mailer
  to send mail to non-existant recipients.

  The second string is the addressee.  The order of the string
  parameters is required (subject first, addressee second).
  The mailer command accpets the text of the mail via standard
  input.  This too is required.

  If you use elm, you might want to change this to:


			"elm -s\"%s\" %s &gt; /dev/null"


  The difference here is that elm prints out a few messages
  when it runs in batch mode and you should send those to
  /dev/null.

<STRONG>BUGS</STRONG>
  The sizes of the Post-it notes are only as accurate as the
  display dimension and resolution returned by the server.  On
  the Sun server and possibly others, this means they aren't
  all that accurate.

  On Linux systems the word wrap feature of the Text Widget
  appears broken.  The words get wrapped to the next line but
  they do not get erased from the previous line.  I'm not sure
  how to fix this.  You can resize the note using the window
  manager to clear the problem, or scroll the note window.

  There was a Warning that writes to stdout regarding a null
  child being managed in the 2.1 version.  I think I found
  what was causing it.  It didn't seem to cause any problems
  before, so if its not fixed, its no big deal.

  The message: ``Warning: XtRemoveGrab asked to remove a
  widget not on the list'' may be written to stdout after an
  alarm popup is dismissed.  This is a timing issue in the X
  libs, I think, and doesn't appear to cause any problems.

  The Dialog used to name a note doesn't limit the number of
  characters that can be used in a name, although it does
  prevent (by use of translations) a user from putting a
  newline in the text.  The drawback to not limiting the
  length of the name is that the dialog box's text field won't
  resize or scroll to the right as characters are typed off
  the right hand edge of the field.  Bummer dude.  This might
  be fixable if key events force a resize on each keystroke.
  Hmmm.  I'll have to think about that one.

  The Hidden Notes menu, if it has no entries, can be fairly
  small (with only a title).  Since this menu doesn't go away
  unless you click on it, it can get hidden under other
  windows running under a window manager which uses autoraise.
  You could probably change this with translations, but I like
  having the menu stay up till I tell it to go away.  Under
  Linux and fvwm, I have one desktop devoted to Post-It notes
  so I don't worry too much about other windows hiding the
  menu.

  The -c option has been reported to not read in old notes
  properly.  It eats the first line.  This can be worked
  around by adding a blank line to the old notes.  However, I
  couldn't reproduce this problem.  I suggest creating a
  backup of your old notes before trying to run with the -c
  option, just in case.

  Without a color display for canary yellow notes and red
  plaid, the aesthetic value of <EM>xpostit</EM> cannot be fully
  appreciated.
