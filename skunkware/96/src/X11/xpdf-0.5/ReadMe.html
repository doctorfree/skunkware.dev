<STRONG>NAME</STRONG>
  xpdf - Portable Document Format (PDF) file viewer for X
  (version 0.5)

<STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>
  <STRONG>xpdf</STRONG> [options] [<EM>PDF</EM>-<EM>file</EM> [<EM>page</EM>]]

<STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
  <STRONG>Xpdf</STRONG> is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files.
  (These are also sometimes also called 'Acrobat' files, from
  the name of Adobe's PDF software.)  Xpdf runs under UNIX or
  VMS and the X Window System.

  To run xpdf, simply type:

	   xpdf file.pdf

  where <EM>file.pdf</EM> is your PDF file.  The file name can be
  followed by a number specifying the page which should be
  displayed first, e.g.:

	   xpdf file.pdf 18

<STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
  X resources are listed in square brackets with the
  corresponding option.

  <STRONG>-err</STRONG> Send error messages to /dev/tty instead of stderr
	   (useful if xpdf is started from another application,
	   e.g., netscape which otherwise pops up an annoying
	   little window for every error).

  <STRONG>-z</STRONG> <EM>number</EM>
	   Set the initial zoom factor (-5 .. 5).
	   [<STRONG>xpdf.initialZoom</STRONG>]

  <STRONG>-g</STRONG> <EM>geometry</EM>
	   Set the initial window geometry.  (<STRONG>-geometry</STRONG> is
	   equivalent.) [<STRONG>xpdf.geometry</STRONG>]

  <STRONG>-remote</STRONG> <EM>name</EM>
	   Start/contact xpdf remote server with specified name
	   (see the <STRONG>REMOTE</STRONG> <STRONG>SERVER</STRONG> <STRONG>MODE</STRONG> section below).

  <STRONG>-raise</STRONG>
	   Raise xpdf remote server window (with -remote only).

  <STRONG>-quit</STRONG>
	   Kill xpdf remote server (with -remote only).

  <STRONG>-rgb</STRONG> <EM>number</EM>
	   Set the size of largest RGB cube xpdf will try to
	   allocate.  The default is 5 (for a 5x5x5 cube); set to
	   a smaller number to conserve color table entries.

  <STRONG>-cmd</STRONG> Print commands as they're executed (useful for
	   debugging).

  <STRONG>-h</STRONG>   Print usage information.  (<STRONG>-help</STRONG> is equivalent.)

  Several other standard X options and resources will work as
  expected:

  <STRONG>-display</STRONG> <EM>display</EM>
	   [<STRONG>xpdf.display</STRONG>]

  <STRONG>-fg</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
	   (<STRONG>-foreground</STRONG> is equivalent.) [<STRONG>xpdf.foreground</STRONG>]

  <STRONG>-bg</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
	   (<STRONG>-background</STRONG> is equivalent.) [<STRONG>xpdf.background</STRONG>]

  <STRONG>-font</STRONG> <EM>font</EM>
	   (<STRONG>-fn</STRONG> is equivalent.) [<STRONG>xpdf.font</STRONG>]

  The color and font options only affect the user interface
  elements, not the PDF display (the 'paper').

<STRONG>CONTROLS</STRONG>
<STRONG>On-screen</STRONG> <STRONG>controls,</STRONG> <STRONG>at</STRONG> <STRONG>the</STRONG> <STRONG>bottom</STRONG> <STRONG>of</STRONG>
  <STRONG>left/right</STRONG> <STRONG>arrow</STRONG> <STRONG>buttons</STRONG>
	   Move to the previous/next page.

  <STRONG>'Page'</STRONG> <STRONG>entry</STRONG> <STRONG>box</STRONG>
	   Move to a specific page number.  Click in the box to
	   activate it, type the page number, then hit return.

  <STRONG>magnifying</STRONG> <STRONG>glass</STRONG> <STRONG>buttons</STRONG>
	   Increase and decrease the resolution, i.e., zoom in and
	   zoom out.

  <STRONG>print</STRONG> <STRONG>button</STRONG>
	   Bring up a dialog for generating a PostScript file.
	   The dialog has options to set the pages to be printed
	   and the PostScript file name.

  <STRONG>curved</STRONG> <STRONG>arrow</STRONG> <STRONG>buttons</STRONG>
	   Rotate the page clockwise and counterclockwise.  These
	   are intended primarily for PDF files where the rotation
	   isn't correctly specified in the file, but they're also
	   useful if your X server doesn't support font rotation.

  <STRONG>'?'</STRONG> <STRONG>button</STRONG>
	   Bring up the 'about xpdf' window.

  <STRONG>'Quit'</STRONG> <STRONG>button</STRONG>
	   Quit xpdf.

<STRONG>Links</STRONG>
  Clicking on a hyperlink will jump to the link's destination.
  Currently, only links within PDF documents or to another PDF
  file are supported.  Clicking on a URL link just prints the
  URL.  Clicking on any other type of link (e.g., links to
  executable programs) prints an error message.

<STRONG>Key</STRONG> <STRONG>bindings</STRONG>
  <STRONG>n</STRONG>    Move to the next page.

  <STRONG>p</STRONG>    Move to the previous page.

  <STRONG>&lt;Space&gt;</STRONG> or <STRONG>&lt;PageDown&gt;</STRONG> or <STRONG>&lt;Next&gt;</STRONG>
	   Scroll down on the current page; if already at bottom,
	   move to next page.

  <STRONG>&lt;Backspace&gt;</STRONG> or <STRONG>&lt;Delete&gt;</STRONG> or <STRONG>&lt;PageUp&gt;</STRONG> or
	   Scroll up on the current page; if already at top, move
	   to previous page.

  <STRONG>&lt;Home&gt;</STRONG>
	   Scroll to top of current page.

  <STRONG>&lt;End&gt;</STRONG>
	   Scroll to bottom of current page.

  <STRONG>arrows</STRONG>
	   Scroll the current page.

  <STRONG>control-L</STRONG>
	   Redraw the current page.

  <STRONG>q</STRONG>    Quit xpdf.

<STRONG>WEB</STRONG> <STRONG>BROWSERS</STRONG>
  If you want to run xpdf automatically from netscape or
  mosaic (and probably other browsers) when you click on a
  link to a PDF file, you need to edit (or create) the files
  .<EM>mime.types</EM> and .<EM>mailcap</EM> in your home directory.  In
  .<EM>mime.types</EM> add the line:

	   application/pdf pdf

  In .<EM>mailcap</EM> add the lines:

	   # Use xpdf to view PDF files.
	   application/pdf; xpdf -err %s

  Make sure that xpdf is on your executable search path.

<STRONG>REMOTE</STRONG> <STRONG>SERVER</STRONG> <STRONG>MODE</STRONG>
  Xpdf can be started in remote server mode by specifying a
  server name (in addition to the file name and page number).
  For example:

	   xpdf -remote myServer file.pdf

  If there is currently no xpdf running in server mode with
  the name 'myServer', a new xpdf window will be opened.  If
  another command:

	   xpdf -remote myServer another.pdf 9

  is issued, a new copy of xpdf will not be started.  Instead,
  the first xpdf (the server) will load <EM>another.pdf</EM> and
  display page nine.  If the file name is the same:

	   xpdf -remote myServer another.pdf 4

  the xpdf server will simply display the specified page.

  The -raise option tells the server to raise its window; it
  can be specified with or without a file name and page
  number.

  The -quit option tells the server to close its window and
  exit.

<STRONG>BUGS</STRONG>
  This is a beta release of xpdf, and there are still a bunch
  of PDF features which I have yet to implement.

  At this point, the biggest problem is that embedded fonts
  are not handled properly.
