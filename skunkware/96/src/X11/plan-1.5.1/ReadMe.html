<STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
  <STRONG>plan</STRONG> is a schedule planner based on X/Motif. It displays a
  month calendar similar to xcal, but every day box is large
  enough to show appointments in small print. By pressing on a
  day box, the appointments for that day can be listed and
  edited. This manual page describes the command line options
  of <STRONG>plan</STRONG>.  For information on how to use <STRONG>plan</STRONG>, refer to the
  on-line help pages.

  <STRONG>plan</STRONG> has two modes: it starts up with a window in
  interactive mode if started without date/time string; with
  date/time on the command line it adds an appointment to the
  list. Only one interactive <STRONG>plan</STRONG> per user can run at any
  time.

  <STRONG>pland</STRONG> is a daemon that watches for appointment triggers. The
  daemon is normally started from your .sgisession or
  .xsession file. It puts itself in the background. If <STRONG>plan</STRONG> is
  started, it checks for the existence of the daemon, and
  offers to start one if it can't find it.

  <STRONG>notifier</STRONG> displays the standard input in a window, with
  appropriate titles and background colors. The only program
  that ever uses it is the daemon; it is a separate program
  only to keep the daemon small.

  <STRONG>netplan</STRONG> is an IP server that is started on one or more
  designated hosts. It is recommended to use a single host
  only. netplan uses a directory to store appointment
  databases. plan and pland programs on various hosts can
  connect to netplan to read and write shared appointment
  databases. Use the File-&gt;File list option in plan to enable
  server mode. netplan must be started manually before any
  plan or pland can connect.


<STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG> <STRONG>OF</STRONG> <STRONG>PLAN</STRONG>
  -h   List available options.

  -d   Print fallback X resources and exit. The output can be
	   appended directly to the ~/.Xdefaults file for
	   modification of the geometry, color, and font defaults.

  -v   Print the program version and patchlevel and exit.

  -o   If used with -t or -T, also prints appointments of all
	   users configured with the Config-&gt;Users popup.

  -t [D [n]]
	   Print a list of today's appointments to stdout. Don't
	   start up interactive windows. The exit status is 0 if
	   there are appointments on the specified date, and 1
	   otherwise. If a date D is specified, print appointments
	   on that date. All standard date specifiers work:

	   -t +3        Print appointments in three days

	   -t -1        Print yesterday's appointments

	   -t tomorrow  Print appointments for tomorrow

	   -t thursday  Print appointments for Thursday

	   -t 25.12.    Print appointments for Christmas, if 24-
					hour mode is selected

	   -t 12/25     Print appointments for Christmas, if 12-
					hour mode is selected.  12/24 hour mode is
					selected with the Config pulldown in the
					main window.

	   If a second argument n is given, n days are printed
	   beginning with day D.  The default is 1. For example,
	   "plan -t today 7" prints one week.

  -T [D [n]]
	   Same as -t, but print the end time instead of the
	   length (hi Vera).

  -s   Standalone, don't offer to start daemon if none exists.
	   Without daemon, no appointment alarms and warnings will
	   trigger. If a daemon happens to exist, it is notified
	   when the database changes, but no warning is printed if
	   it doesn't.

  -f   Don't fork on startup. This is useful for debugging.

  -k   If there appears to be another <STRONG>plan</STRONG> running, start up
	   anyway. This is useful if a /tmp/.plan&lt;uid&gt; file got
	   accidentally left behind, and plan fails to check
	   whether the older plan still exists. This option is
	   largely obsolete in version 1.2.

  [mmdd]hhmm [message]*
	   Add an appointment at mm/dd hh:mm (month/day
	   hours:minutes). If mmdd is not specified, today's date
	   is used. The message, which should be quoted if it
	   contains shell metacharacters, is used as note string.
	   No menus will start up. No option may be specified.


<STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG> <STRONG>OF</STRONG> <STRONG>PLAND</STRONG>
  -d   Debug mode. Runs pland in the foreground without
	   forking, and prints debugging information. Recommended
	   if pland seems to die unexpectedly.  (The most common
	   cause of disappearing pland's is a nonfunctional utmp;
	   if -d is used pland recommends to recompile with the
	   -DRABBITS option.) This option must precede the other
	   options.

  -k   If another daemon exists, kill it and restart.

  -K   (captal K) If another daemon exists, kill it and exit.


<STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG> <STRONG>OF</STRONG> <STRONG>NOTIFIER</STRONG>
  -h   List available options.

  -d   Print fallback X resources and exit. The output can be
	   appended directly to the ~/.Xdefaults file for
	   modification of the geometry, color, and font defaults.

  -v   Print the program version and patchlevel and exit.

  -1   Set the window background color to green (early
	   warning).

  -2   Set the window background color to yellow (late
	   warning).

  -3   Set the window background color to red (alarm). This is
	   the default.

  -t<EM>title</EM>
	   Set the title string above the message text (which is
	   read from stdin).

  -s<EM>subtitle</EM>
	   Set the subtitle string below the main title, in a
	   small font.

  -i<EM>icontitle</EM>
	   Set the icon title string that is printed below the
	   mwm/4Dwm icon.

  In addition to these options, plan and notifier support the
  usual X options -iconic and -geometry.


<STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG> <STRONG>OF</STRONG> <STRONG>NETPLAN</STRONG>
  -d   Debug mode. Start in the foreground and print debugging
	   information to stderr.

  -v   If -d is also specified, print more verbose debugging
	   information.


<STRONG>FILES</STRONG>
  Below, DIR and LIB refer to the installation directories
  specified at the beginning of the Makefile when the programs
  were compiled. By defauly, they are /usr/local/bin and
  /usr/local/lib, respectively. These are the directories
  where <STRONG>plan</STRONG> and <STRONG>pland</STRONG> first search for executables and
  plan.help (LIB first, then DIR). Next, $PLAN_PATH and $PATH
  are searched, and finally, a built-in search path that also
  contains "." as its last item.

  ~/.dayplan
	   Database with all public entries and configuration
	   options of <STRONG>plan</STRONG>.  See plan(4) for details.

  ~/.dayplan.priv
	   Database with all private entries.

  ~/.holiday
	   Definition of holidays. See the help text for the
	   "Define Holiday" popup menu that can be installed with
	   the Holiday pulldown.

  /tmp/.planUID
	   Lockfile that contains the PID of <STRONG>plan</STRONG>.  Used to
	   prevent multiple <STRONG>plan</STRONG> instances, and to send HUP
	   signals to if a non-interactive <STRONG>plan</STRONG> invocation changed
	   the database. UID is the user's numerical user ID.

  /tmp/.plandUID
	   Lockfile that contains the PID of the <STRONG>pland</STRONG> daemon.
	   Used to prevent multiple daemons, and to send HUP
	   signals to if the database changed for any reason. UID
	   is the user's numerical user ID.

  DIR/plan
	   The <STRONG>plan</STRONG> program.

  LIB/pland
	   The <STRONG>pland</STRONG> daemon. It must be in the DIR or LIB
	   directory, or in one of the directories in one of the
	   search paths.

  LIB/notifier
	   The <STRONG>notifier</STRONG> program. It must be in the DIR or LIB
	   directory, or in one of the directories in one of the
	   search paths.

  LIB/netplan
	   The <STRONG>netplan</STRONG> IP server. It must be in the DIR or LIB
	   directory, or in one of the directories in one of the
	   search paths. It cannot be started by the root user.

  LIB/netplan.dir
	   The directory where <STRONG>netplan</STRONG> stores all its databases.
	   It must be writable by any user who might start
	   <STRONG>netplan.</STRONG>

  LIB/plan.help
	   The online help texts used by <STRONG>plan</STRONG>.  It must be in the
	   DIR or LIB directory, or in one of the directories in
	   one of the search paths.

  LIB/holiday
	   Definition of system standard holidays. They are read
	   before ~/.holiday, and can be overridden in ~/.holiday.
	   They must be edited manually with a text editor.

  Note that previous versions put all executables into the DIR
  directory.  Beginning with 1.4.7, all executables except
  <STRONG>plan</STRONG> are in LIB. To avoid finding obsolete executables
  first, LIB is searched befor DIR.
