    **************************  ABOUT LLNL XFTP  *************************
    **********************************************************************

    LLNL XFTP, an OSF/Motif-based FTP client, enables you to graphically
    transfer files and perform various directory manipulation commands,
    both locally and remotely.  Two especially notable features are the
	ability to (1) perform "third-party" (i.e., remote-to-remote) file
    transfers, and (2) transfer or delete entire directory substructures.
    LLNL XFTP has many features, is configurable, and has an intuitive
    user interface.

    LLNL XFTP is a precursor to LLNL XDIR, a much more sophisticated
    graphical FTP client.  LLNL XDIR features drag-and-drop file transfer,
    powerful directory browsing, and multihost searching.  Unless you
    would prefer LLNL XFTP's compact interface over LLNL XDIR's multiwindow
    approach, we recommend that you use LLNL XDIR.  Source code for LLNL
    XDIR is available as follows:

    LLNL XFTP was written by Neale Smith of the Lawrence Livermore National
    Laboratory, which is operated by the University of California.

    ************************  BUILDING LLNL XFTP  ************************
    **********************************************************************

    LLNL XFTP requires OSF/Motif 1.2 or later (earlier versions of Motif
    might work okay, but don't bother with anything earlier than 1.1.4).

    One version or another of LLNL XFTP has been successfully built on the
    following platforms (and a bunch of others):

          Computer            System                        Motif

          Intel 486           BSD/386                       1.2.2
          i486                System V R4.0.3               1.2
          i386                SVR4                          1.2.1
          Intel               SCO Open Desktop 3.0          1.2.1
          PowerMac 6100       MachTen 4.0                   1.1.4

    Perform the following steps to build LLNL XFTP:

    1. Enter the "sources" directory and type "xmkmf" to create "Makefile"
       from "Imakefile".  If you are unable to get this to work, use the
       backup makefile, "Makefile.alt", by uncommenting (and possibly
       editing) the section which seems most promising for your platform.

       NOTE: Follow instructions at beginning of Imakefile or Makefile.alt
             if you wish to build a SOCKSified executable.

    2. Type "make" to build the executable "xftp".

    3. Type "make install" to install the executable and the application
       defaults file.

    4. Type "make install.man" to install the man page.


    **********************************************************************
    ********************  Application Defaults File  *********************
    **********************************************************************

    It is usually not necessary to use an application defaults file with
    LLNL XFTP (since LLNL XFTP contains built-in fallback values).  You may
    wish to use an application defaults file with LLNL XFTP if you want to
    customize certain widget attributes such as fonts or colors.

    The application defaults file is named "XFtp".  (A symbolic link to
    XFtp is in the "sources" subdirectory.)  Make sure that XFtp is in
    the search path of one of the X application defaults file environment
    variables (e.g., XAPPLRESDIR, XFILESEARCHPATH, or XUSERFILESEARCHPATH).
    Consult the usual X documentation on how to set and use these environment
    variables.

    NOTE: LLNL XFTP 2.1 is not compatible with the earlier versions of the
    app defaults file.  A sure sign that an old XFtp is being picked up is
    that the file transfer monitor (the dialog that appears during file
    transfers) will look funny.


    **********************************************************************
    ***************************  Limitations  ****************************
    **********************************************************************
    
    Here are some things to watch out for:

      (1) LLNL XFTP might not work with some old X servers.  For example,
          some older OpenWindows servers might dump core.  MacX fans should
          use nothing older than version 1.1.7b.

      (2) Old, buggy versions of Motif can cause weirdness.

      (3) LLNL XFTP might not work correctly with some non-Unix FTP servers
          (If you can give us temporary access to such a server, we might
          be able to fix the problem.)

      (4) Out-of-spec FTP servers can cause untold grief.  (Most Unix-based
          servers work correctly.)

      (5) Third-party file transfers will not work unless at least one of
          the remote FTP servers supports the PASV (passive) command.
