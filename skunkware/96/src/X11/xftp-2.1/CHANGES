                  *   What's New in LLNL XFTP 2.1b2   *
                  *************************************

  Fixed some problems:
  --------------------

  o  Fixed logic for aborting file transfer of file to be viewed.

  o  The user preference PRESERVE VMS VER NUMS now works again (this was
     broken in 2.1b1).

     to be lost if an operation is performed on an empty directory.

  o  User names with embedded spaces now correctly handled by connection
     dialogs.

  o  Fixed bug that could sometimes cause directory entries to be listed
     slightly out of order.

  o  Improved logic for aborting file transfers from Unitree to local host.

  o  Processing of "quoted" command now continues if a 3xx reply is received
     from the FTP server.

  o  Fixed bug that prevented some VMS files from being successfully viewed.

  o  Fixed bug that caused bogus transfer times for viewed files to be
     reported.

  o  Plugged a memory leak.


                  *************************************
                  *   What's New in LLNL XFTP 2.1b1   *
                  *************************************

  New Functionality:
  ------------------

  o  The ability to automatically stage and read Unitree files that are
     not on disk.

  o  The ability for the user to specify (via a new user preference,
     OVERWRITE DIR ON COPY) whether it is okay to overwrite an existing
     directory when recursively copying another directory with the same
     name.
     

  Fixed some problems:
  --------------------

  o  Xftp now works with versions 2.3 and 2.4 of FTPd, a Macintosh FTP 
     server.

  o  Eliminated compiler warning errors on Solaris, NeXT, and FreeBSD
     systems.


  Other minor changes:
  --------------------

  o  Removed widget heirarchy documentation from man page (it was out of
     date and not worth maintaining because the source code is available).

  o  There is now only one application default file, XFtp.  Formerly,
     there were two: XFtp.color and XFtp.mono.  The new XFtp is similar
     to the old XFtp.color.

  o  Added a command line option, "-color," which forces LLNL XFTP to use
     a nice color scheme, even if the application defaults file, XFtp, is
     not found. 

  o  Added sections to Makefile.alt for building on Solaris with gcc and
     for statically building on Solaris.

  Fixed some problems:
  --------------------

  o  Fixed memory allocation bugs in file viewer logic.

  o  Fixed bug that could cause core dump if file transfer time is zero.

  o  Changed names of local variables "index" in order to avoid name
     conflicts on some systems.

  o  Now use XmFONTLIST_DEFAULT_TAG instead of XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET
     as arguments in calls to XmStringGetLtoR() and XmStringCreateLtoR()
     when building with Motif 1.2.

  o  Fixed bug that could cause a broken TCP connection to go undetected.

  o  Fixed bug that could cause failure to get remote directory name to
     go undetected.

  o  Fixed bug that could cause infinite looping on failed third-party
     file transfer.

  o  Improved Imakefile for BSD/OS.

  o  Fixed problem where "dot" files on some remote systems (e.g., IRIX
     and AIX) were not listed.

  o  Fixed bug that could cause problem on DEC OSF/1 when displaying a
     local long directory list.

  o  Fixed problems in the dialogs that monitor the progress of operations
     (such as file transfers and deletes) that could occasionally make them
     unreadable.

  o  Added section to Makefile.alt for SGI IRIX 4.x.


  Changed functionality:
  ----------------------

  o  Cached hostname/username pairs of form "ftp@host" and "anonymous@host"

     affect users outside of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

  o  An easier way to re-enter previously visited directories:
         "Go to Previous Directory" in "Dir" menus

  o  The ability to specify whether to automatically enter newly created
     directories:
         "Enter Dir Upon Creation" in "Preferences" dialog (via "Options" menu)
