<STRONG>NAME</STRONG>
  LLNL XFTP - an X-based interface to FTP


<STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>
  xftp [options]


<STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> is a graphical user interface to FTP (File
  Transfer Protocol).  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> does not execute the <EM>ftp</EM>
  program; instead, it directly communicates with remote FTP
  servers.  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> is an X client and follows the OSF/Motif
  look-and-feel.  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> enables users to transfer files
  and perform various directory manipulation commands, both
  remotely and locally.  Two especially notable features are
  the ability to (1) perform "third-party" file transfers, and
  (2) transfer or delete entire directory substructures.

  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM>'<STRONG>s</STRONG> main window is divided into five main sections:
  (1) the main menu bar at the top of the window,  (2) the
  diagnostics log at the bottom, (3) the file transfer
  controls in the center, and (4 and 5) the "left" and "right"
  host sections to either side of the file transfer controls.

  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> can be connected to zero, one, or two hosts.  The
  hosts may be any combination of local and remote hosts (the
  local host is the client host upon which <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> is
  running).  In this document, a connected host is referred to
  as either the "left" or "right" host, depending on whether
  it is displayed in the left or right host section,
  respectively.

  Each host section consists of four major graphical elements:
  (1) a label which displays the host's name; (2) a menu bar
  whose menus contain many commands that operate on the host;
  (3) a "directory" menu; and (4) a scrollable "directory
  list."

  Each host's <EM>Connect</EM> menu contains commands for
  connecting/disconnecting local and remote hosts.

  Each host's <EM>Dir</EM> menu contains various commands for creating
  new directories, and for changing and displaying the current
  directory.

  Each host's <EM>Select</EM> menu contains commands for
  selecting/deselecting entries in the current directory (the
  selections appear in the scrollable list of directory
  entries).

  Each host's <EM>Ops</EM> menu contains several commands that operate
  on selected directory entries.

  Each host's directory menu contains each link of the path of
  the current directory (the last link is displayed).  By
  selecting a link in the path, the current directory is
  correspondingly changed.  (Hence, this is a mechanism to
  traverse up the host's directory structure.)

  Each host's directory list contains the entries of the
  current directory.  One way to select/deselect a directory
  entry is to click on it.  If an entry is double-clicked, an
  attempt is made to change the current directory to that
  entry.  (Hence, this is a way to traverse down the host's
  directory structure.)

  The file transfer controls in the middle of the main window
  allow the user to initiate file transfers on selected
  entries.  The transfers can go from left to right or from
  right to left.  Angle brackets in the <EM>Copy</EM> and <EM>Rcopy</EM> buttons
  indicate the direction of the transfer (e.g., "&gt;&gt;Copy&gt;&gt;"
  indicates that a left-to-right transfer would take place).
  The <EM>View</EM> button causes the selected file to be displayed.

  The scrollable diagnostics log window at the bottom of the
  main window displays error and status information.  The user
  can control the level of verbosity of messages written to
  this window via the user preference <EM>Diagnostics</EM>.  The
  contents of this window can be saved to a file by selecting
  the <EM>Save</EM> <EM>Log</EM> item in the <EM>Log</EM> menu.  The diagnostics window
  can be cleared by selecting the <EM>Clear</EM> <EM>Log</EM> item in the <EM>Log</EM>
  menu.

  There is a flag to the left of the diagnostics log window
  that indicates whether an operation completes successfully
  or not.  If an operation fails then (1) a beep is emitted,
  (2) the flag changes from green to red (white to black on
  monochrome displays), (3) the "OK" in the flag changes to
  "E", and (4) an error message is written to the diagnostic
  log window. The next operation will clear the error flag.

  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> automatically caches (1) wildcard expressions, (2)
  paths of current directories, (3) host names and user names
  used in connecting to remote hosts, and (4) quoted commands.
  The purpose of each cache is to reduce the amount of typing
  required.  For example, when the user wishes to apply a
  wildcard expression to select directory entries, a list of
  recently referenced wildcard expressions for that host will
  be presented to the user; the user can then double-click on
  an existing wildcard expression to apply it.  The cache is
  automatically preserved across <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> sessions in a file
  named ".xftpcache" in the users home directory.

<STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line
  options, as well as the following option:

  -color
	   Force <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> to use a nice color scheme, even if the
	   application defaults file, <EM>XFtp</EM>, is not found.

<STRONG>GETTING</STRONG> <STRONG>STARTED</STRONG>
  Use the <EM>Connect</EM> menus to connect the two sides to the
  desired combination of local and/or remote hosts.
  (Depending on how the user preferences are set, when <EM>LLNL</EM>
  <EM>XFTP</EM> comes up some combination of the left and right sides
  might already be connected to the local host.)

  Once connected, traverse through a host's directory
  structure by (1) using the directory name menu (the menu
  just above the directory list), (2) double-clicking on
  entries in the directory list, (3) selecting an item in the
  <EM>Go</EM> <EM>to</EM> <EM>Previous</EM> <EM>Directory</EM> submenu in the host's <EM>Dir</EM> menu, or
  (4) selecting the <EM>Change</EM> <EM>Directory</EM> item in the host's <EM>Dir</EM>
  menu.

  Obtain different types of views into a host's current
  directory by selecting the <EM>Display</EM> <EM>Directory</EM> (<EM>Long)</EM> or
  <EM>Display</EM> <EM>Directory</EM> (<EM>Table)</EM> items in the host's <EM>Dir</EM> menu.

  Select/deselect directory entries to operate on by (1)
  single-clicking on entries in the main directory list, (2)
  single-clicking on entries in the tabular directory list,
  (3) dragging the mouse with the left button held down over
  entries in the tabular directory list, or (4) by selecting
  any of the items in the host's <EM>Select</EM> menu.

  Transfer selected items by clicking on the <EM>Copy</EM> or <EM>Rcopy</EM>
  (recursive copy) buttons.  Be sure to first set the file
  transfer mode by toggling the appropriate button (<EM>ASCII</EM> or
  <EM>Binary)</EM> in the main window.

  View a selected file by clicking on the <EM>View</EM> button.
  Configure the viewer by selecting item <EM>Viewer</EM> <EM>Preferences</EM> in
  the <EM>Options</EM> menu.  Be sure to first set the file transfer
  mode by toggling the appropriate button (<EM>ASCII</EM> or <EM>Binary)</EM> in
  the main window.

  Perform other types of operations on selected items by
  selecting any one of the items in the host's <EM>Ops</EM> menu.

  Configure <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> by selecting the <EM>Preferences</EM> item in the
  <EM>Options</EM> menu.

<STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG>
  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> contains a large number of commands.  The commands
  are found in (1) the main menus, (2) the host menus, and (3)
  in the <EM>Xfer</EM> <EM>Ops</EM> controls.  Here is a list of the commands:

  About LLNL XFTP (in <EM>File</EM> menu)
	   Gives version information.

  Change Directory (in <EM>Dir</EM> menus)
	   Change the current directory.  A dialog pops up to
	   prompt for the directory to change to.  The directory
	   may be specified with a full or relative path.
	   Previously referenced directories are cached and
	   displayed in a scrollable list.  Double-click on a path
	   in the list to change to that directory.  Single click
	   on a path in the list to place that entry into the text
	   field labeled "Directory:", where it can be edited.
	   Click on the <EM>OK</EM> button to change to the directory
	   displayed in the text field.  (See user preferences <EM>Add</EM>
	   <EM>to</EM> <EM>Cache</EM>, <EM>Diagnostics</EM>, <EM>Directory</EM> <EM>Cache</EM> <EM>Size</EM>, <EM>Host</EM> <EM>Cache</EM>
	   <EM>Size</EM>, and <EM>Sort</EM> <EM>Caches</EM>.)

  Clear Log (in <EM>Log</EM> menu)
	   Clear the diagnostics log window.

  Connect to Anonymous (in <EM>Connect</EM> menus)
	   Easily connect to an anonymous FTP site.  If currently
	   connected, the connection is first closed.  A dialog
	   pops up to prompt for the remote host, user name and
	   password.  The user name is initialized to "anonymous".
	   The password is initialized to the value of the user
	   preference <EM>Anonymous</EM> <EM>Ftp</EM> <EM>Password</EM> (which you will
	   probably want to set to your email address).  An
	   optional port number may follow the host name (using a
	   space as the delimiter).  Previously used host/user
	   name pairs are cached, and those with user names
	   "anonymous" or "ftp" are displayed in a scolled list
	   labeled "Recently Referenced Hosts:".  Double-clicking
	   on a host/user name pair initiates a connection.
	   Single-clicking on a host/user name pair places those
	   values in to the host name and user name fields, where
	   they can be edited.  Click on the <EM>Connect</EM> button to
	   initiate a connection.  (See user preferences <EM>Add</EM> <EM>To</EM>
	   <EM>Cache</EM>, <EM>Anonymous</EM> <EM>Ftp</EM> <EM>Password</EM>, <EM>Diagnostics</EM>, <EM>Host</EM> <EM>Cache</EM>
	   <EM>Size</EM>, <EM>User</EM> <EM>Cache</EM> <EM>Size</EM>, and <EM>Sort</EM> <EM>Caches</EM>.)

  Connect to Local (in <EM>Connect</EM> menus)
	   Connect to the local (client) host.  If currently
	   connected, the connection is first closed.  (See user
	   preferences <EM>Left</EM> <EM>Auto</EM> <EM>Local</EM> <EM>Login</EM> and <EM>Right</EM> <EM>Auto</EM> <EM>Local</EM>
	   <EM>Login</EM>.)

  Connect to Remote (in <EM>Connect</EM> menus)
	   Connect to a remote host (use <EM>Connect</EM> <EM>to</EM> <EM>Anonymous</EM> to
	   more easily connect to an anonymous FTP site).  If
	   currently connected, the connection is first closed.  A
	   dialog pops up to prompt for the remote host and user
	   names. The user name is initialized to the value of the
	   environment variable <EM>USER</EM>.  An optional port number may
	   follow the host name (using a space as the delimiter).
	   Previously used host/user name pairs are cached and
	   those with user names other than "anonymous" and "ftp"
	   displayed in a scolled list labeled "Recently
	   Referenced Hosts:".  Double-clicking on a host/user
	   name pair initiates a connection.  Single-clicking on a
	   host/user name pair places those values into the host
	   name and user name fields, where they can be edited.
	   Click on the <EM>Connect</EM> button to initiate a connection.
	   (See user preferences <EM>Add</EM> <EM>To</EM> <EM>Cache</EM>, <EM>Diagnostics</EM>, <EM>Host</EM>
	   <EM>Cache</EM> <EM>Size</EM>, <EM>User</EM> <EM>Cache</EM> <EM>Size</EM>, and <EM>Sort</EM> <EM>Caches</EM>.)

  Contextual Help (in <EM>Help</EM> menu)
	   Enter contextual-help mode.  The mouse cursor changes
	   to a pointing hand.  Move the hand and click on any
	   graphical element in the main window that you wish to
	   know more about.

  Copy (in <EM>Xfer</EM> <EM>Ops</EM> controls)
	   Transfers the selected files according to the mode
	   (<EM>ASCII</EM> or <EM>Binary)</EM> specified in <EM>Xfer</EM> <EM>Mode</EM>.  A dialog
	   pops up to enable the user to monitor the progress of
	   the transfers.  The dialog contains a button for
	   aborting the transfers.  (See user preferences <EM>Beep</EM>
	   <EM>When</EM> <EM>Ops</EM> <EM>Done</EM>, <EM>Diagnostics</EM>, <EM>Initial</EM> <EM>Transfer</EM> <EM>Mode</EM>, and
	   <EM>Inquire</EM> <EM>On</EM> <EM>Copy</EM>.)

  Delete Selected Entry(s) (in <EM>Ops</EM> menus)
	   Deletes the selected entries.  A dialog pops up to
	   enable the user to monitor the progress of the
	   deletions.  The dialog contains a button for aborting
	   the deletions.  (See user preferences <EM>Beep</EM> <EM>When</EM> <EM>Ops</EM>
	   <EM>Done</EM>, <EM>Diagnostics</EM>, and <EM>Inquire</EM> <EM>On</EM> <EM>Delete</EM>.)

  Deselect All Entries (in <EM>Select</EM> menus)
	   Deselect all the entries in the host's current
	   directory.

  Disconnect (in <EM>Connect</EM> menus)
	   Close the currently connected host.  (See user
	   preference <EM>Diagnostics</EM>.)

  Display Directory (Long) (in <EM>Dir</EM> menus)
	   Pops up a dialog that displays the contents of the
	   current directory in a scrollable list.  If supported
	   by the host (and this is almost always the case),
	   additional information about each directory entry is
	   displayed, such as file length and access restrictions.
	   This display is automatically updated as the current
	   directory changes.  This directory display does not
	   support selecting entries or displaying the current
	   selection.  <EM>Warning</EM>: Using this feature can increase
	   network traffic, put an additional load on the remote
	   host, and slow down interactivity.   (See user
	   preference <EM>Diagnostics</EM> and <EM>Sort</EM> <EM>Long</EM> <EM>Lists</EM> <EM>By</EM> <EM>Date</EM>.)

  Display Directory Path (in <EM>Dir</EM> menus)
	   Pops up a dialog that displays the current directory
	   for that host.  It will be automatically updated as the
	   current directory changes.  (See user preference
	   <EM>Diagnostics</EM>.)

  Display Directory (Table) (in <EM>Dir</EM> menus)
	   Pops up a dialog that displays the contents of the
	   current directory in tabular form.  This dialog may be
	   used to view and modify the directory's selected
	   entries.  Entries may be selected/deselected either by
	   clicking or by moving the cursor over the entries with
	   the mouse button down.  Moving the mouse too quickly
	   can cause some of the entries to be skipped.  If an
	   entry is double-clicked, an attempt is made to change
	   the current directory to that entry.  This display is
	   automatically updated as the current directory changes.
	   (See user preference <EM>Diagnostics</EM>.)

  Getting Started (in <EM>Help</EM> menu)
	   Describes how to get started using <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM>.

  Go to Previous Directory (in <EM>Dir</EM> menus)
	   Displays a pullright menu that allows the user to
	   easily change the current directory to a previously
	   referenced directory.  (See user preferences <EM>Add</EM> <EM>to</EM>
	   <EM>Cache</EM>, <EM>Diagnostics</EM>, <EM>Directory</EM> <EM>Cache</EM> <EM>Size</EM>, <EM>Host</EM> <EM>Cache</EM>
	   <EM>Size</EM>, and <EM>Sort</EM> <EM>Caches</EM>.)

  LLNL XFTP Overview (in <EM>Help</EM> menu)
	   Gives a high-level description of <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM>.

  Make Directory (in <EM>Dir</EM> menus)
	   Pops up a dialog to prompt for the name of a directory
	   to make in the current directory.  The user preference
	   <EM>Enter</EM> <EM>Dir</EM> <EM>Upon</EM> <EM>Creation</EM> controls whether the the newly
	   created directory is automatically entered upon
	   creation.  (See user preferences <EM>Diagnostics</EM> and <EM>Enter</EM>
	   <EM>Dir</EM> <EM>Upon</EM> <EM>Creation</EM>.)

  Move Selected Entry(s) (in <EM>Ops</EM> menus)
	   Move selected entries from the current directory to
	   another directory on the same host.  This is similar to
	   the UNIX <EM>mv</EM> command, but without rename capability.
	   (See user preferences <EM>Beep</EM> <EM>When</EM> <EM>Ops</EM> <EM>Done</EM>, and
	   <EM>Diagnostics</EM>.)

  Preferences (in <EM>Options</EM> menu)
	   Display the user preferences dialog.  See <EM>USER</EM>
	   <EM>PREFERENCES</EM> section for a description of user
	   preferences.

  Quit (in <EM>File</EM> menu)
	   Terminate <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM>.

  Rcopy (in <EM>Xfer</EM> <EM>Ops</EM> controls)
	   Recursively transfers the selected entries according to
	   the mode (<EM>ASCII</EM> or <EM>Binary)</EM> specified in <EM>Xfer</EM> <EM>Mode</EM>.  If
	   a selected entry is a directory, an attempt is made to
	   transfer its entire directory subtree.  The user
	   preference <EM>Overwrite</EM> <EM>Dir</EM> <EM>On</EM> <EM>Copy</EM> lets the user control
	   whether or not it is okay to overwrite an existing
	   directory.  A dialog pops up to enable the user to
	   monitor the progress of the transfers.  The dialog
	   contains a button for aborting the transfers.  (See
	   user preferences <EM>Beep</EM> <EM>When</EM> <EM>Ops</EM> <EM>Done</EM>, <EM>Diagnostics</EM>,
	   <EM>Initial</EM> <EM>Xfer</EM> <EM>Mode</EM>, <EM>Inquire</EM> <EM>On</EM> <EM>Copy</EM>, and <EM>Overwrite</EM> <EM>Dir</EM>
	   <EM>On</EM> <EM>Copy</EM>.)

  Recursively Delete Selected Entry(s) (in <EM>Ops</EM> menus)
	   Recursively deletes the selected entries.  A dialog
	   pops up to enable the user to monitor the progress of
	   the deletions.  The dialog contains a button for
	   aborting the deletions.  <EM>Warning</EM>: Exercise extreme
	   caution when using this command because it deletes
	   entire directory subtrees.  To minimize the chance of
	   an unintentional deletion, this menu item is greyed out
	   unless the user preference <EM>Recursive</EM> <EM>Delete</EM> <EM>Enabled</EM> is
	   enabled.  (See user preferences <EM>Beep</EM> <EM>When</EM> <EM>Ops</EM> <EM>Done</EM>,
	   <EM>Diagnostics</EM>, <EM>Inquire</EM> <EM>On</EM> <EM>Delete</EM>, and <EM>Recursive</EM> <EM>Delete</EM>
	   <EM>Enabled</EM>.)

  Rename Selected Entry(s) (in <EM>Ops</EM> menus)
	   Pop up a dialog to individually rename selected
	   entries.  This is similar to the UNIX <EM>mv</EM> command except
	   that the renamed entries cannot be moved to another
	   directory.  (See user preference <EM>Diagnostics</EM>.)

  Save Log (in <EM>Log</EM> menu)
	   Write the contents of the diagnostics window to a
	   user-specified file.  The existing contents of the
	   diagnostics window are not removed.

  Save Preferences (in <EM>Options</EM> menu)
	   Save the current settings of the user and viewer
	   preferences.

  Select All Entries (in <EM>Select</EM> menus)
	   Select all the entries in the host's current directory.

  Send Quoted Command (in <EM>Ops</EM> menus)
	   Pops up a dialog to prompt for a "raw" command to send
	   to the FTP server of the remote host.  Previously
	   issued commands are cached and displayed in a scrolled
	   list.  Double-clicking on a command in the list issues
	   that command.  To have a command act on items selected
	   in the host's directory list, use the quote placeholder
	   (which by default is "&lt;&gt;") to represent a selected
	   item.  For example, type "stage 1 &lt;&gt;" to send a STAGE
	   command to the the remote host for each selected item.
	   The quote placeholder can changed via the user
	   preferences.  (See user preferences <EM>Beep</EM> <EM>When</EM> <EM>Ops</EM> <EM>Done</EM>,
	   <EM>Diagnostics</EM>, and <EM>Quote</EM> <EM>Placeholder</EM>.)

  Use Wildcard (in <EM>Select</EM> menus)
	   Pops up a dialog to prompt for a wildcard expression to
	   use in selecting entries in the host's current
	   directory list.  Previously referenced wildcard
	   expressions are cached and displayed in a scrolled
	   list.  Double-clicking on an item in the list applies
	   that wildcard expression.  Single-clicking on an item
	   in the list places the expression in a text field where
	   it may be edited.  Choose the toggle item <EM>Replace</EM>
	   <EM>Filename</EM> <EM>Selection</EM> to cause the currently selected
	   entries to be cleared before applying the wildcard.
	   Choose the toggle item <EM>Add</EM> <EM>to</EM> <EM>Filename</EM> <EM>Selection</EM> to
	   cause the entries selected by the wildcard to be added
	   to the current selection.  (See user preference <EM>Initial</EM>
	   <EM>Wildcard</EM> <EM>Mode)</EM>.

  Using Help (in <EM>Help</EM> menu)
	   Gives a description of the online help package.

  View (in <EM>Xfer</EM> <EM>Ops</EM> controls)
	   Displays the selected file.  The <EM>Viewer</EM> <EM>Preferences</EM>
	   dialog (accessible via the <EM>Options</EM> menu) can be used to
	   control whether the file will be displayed using the
	   built-in viewer or using an external viewer of the
	   user's choice (e.g., <EM>emacs</EM> or <EM>xv)</EM>.  The selection of
	   the viewer is configurable, based on the file extension
	   (e.g., ".gif" or ".jpg").  There is no limit on the
	   number or types of viewers that can be simultaneously
	   displayed.

	   The file is transferred according to the mode (<EM>ASCII</EM> or
	   <EM>Binary)</EM> specified in <EM>Xfer</EM> <EM>Mode</EM>.  A dialog pops up to
	   enable the user to monitor the progress of the
	   transfer.  The dialog contains a button for aborting
	   the transfer.

	   The destination of the transfer is a temporary
	   directory created in the directory defined as <EM>P_tmpdir</EM>
	   in the include file stdio.h.  If the environment
	   variable <EM>TMPDIR</EM> is defined, it is used as the
	   directory.  The temporary directory, and the files it
	   contains, are automatically deleted when the user
	   dismisses the viewer or terminates <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM>.

	   If the file is recognized as being compressed, it is
	   expanded before viewing.  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> excutes the
	   following decompressors based on the file extension:
	   <EM>gunzip</EM> for ".z" and ".gz"; <EM>uncompress</EM> for ".Z"; <EM>atob</EM>
	   for "atob"; and <EM>uudecode</EM> for ".uu".  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> searches
	   for the decompressor application in the standard way
	   using the <EM>PATH</EM> environment variable.

  Viewer Preferences (in <EM>Options</EM> menu)
	   Display the viewer preferences dialog.  See <EM>VIEWER</EM>
	   <EM>PREFERENCES</EM> section for a description of viewer
	   preferences.

<STRONG>USER</STRONG> <STRONG>PREFERENCES</STRONG>
  Selecting item <EM>Preferences</EM> in the <EM>Options</EM> menu pops up a
  dialog that allows the user to configure <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> according
  to his/her preferences.  The user is presented with a number
  of configuration parameters, which are set by either
  toggling, sliding, or typing.  Click the <EM>Apply</EM> button to
  cause the new values to take effect.  The <EM>OK</EM> button has the
  same effect as <EM>Apply</EM>, but the dialog is also closed.  The
  <EM>Cancel</EM> button undoes changes made since <EM>OK</EM> or <EM>Apply</EM> were
  last pressed.  The preferences can be preserved across <EM>LLNL</EM>
  <EM>XFTP</EM> sessions in a text file named ".xftprc" in the user's
  home directory.  The user may alter the order the
  preferences are presented in the dialog by (1) terminating
  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM>, (2) using a text editor to change the order of
  lines in ".xftprc" and (3) restarting <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM>.

	   Specifies whether newly referenced items should be
	   added to the directory, quoted command, wildcard, and
	   host/user caches.  It is usually desirable to choose
	   <EM>Yes</EM>.  Choose <EM>No</EM> if referencing a series of seldom-
	   referenced items that would clear the cache of your
	   favorite entries.

  Anonymous Ftp Password
	   The value to initialize the "Password" field of the
	   <EM>Connect</EM> <EM>to</EM> <EM>Anonymous</EM> dialog to.  This is normally your
	   email address.  The <EM>Connect</EM> <EM>to</EM> <EM>Anonymous</EM> dialog is
	   accessible via each host's <EM>Connect</EM> menu.

  Beep When Ops Done
	   Specifes whether to beep when each set of deletion,
	   move, quoted command, and file transfer operations
	   completes.

  Diagnostics
	   Specifies the level of diagnostics information to be
	   written to the diagnostics log window.  Choose <EM>Quiet</EM>
	   for error messages, only.  Choose <EM>Normal</EM> for error
	   messages and success messages.  Choose <EM>Verbose</EM> for
	   error messages, success messages, and replies received
	   from the FTP servers.  Choose <EM>Debug</EM> for error messages,
	   success messages, commands sent to the FTP servers,
	   replies received from the FTP servers, and other
	   assorted diagnostics.

  Directory Cache Size
	   The maximum number of previously referenced directory
	   paths cached per host.  The cache is preserved across
	   <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> sessions.

  Enhance Colors
	   Speficies whether to "pretty up" some of the graphical
	   elements (such as scrolled lists and text fields) by
	   changing the normal background colors.  This preference
	   has no effect on monochrome displays.  Choose <EM>Yes</EM> to
	   enhance the appearance, or <EM>No</EM> for the usual Motif look.

  Enter Dir Upon Creation
	   Specifies whether to automatically enter a newly
	   created directory.

  Host Cache Size
	   The maximum number of hosts to cache items for.  The
	   cache is preserved across <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> sessions.

  Initial Logfile Name
	   The default file name to be presented to the user in
	   the "Save Log" dialog.

  Initial Transfer Mode
	   The default file transfer mode (<EM>ASCII</EM> or <EM>Binary)</EM>.

  Initial Wildcard Mode
	   The default mode of the "Use Wildcard" dialog.  Choose
	   <EM>Replace</EM> to make "Replace Filename Selection" the
	   default.  Choose <EM>Add</EM> to make "Add to Filename
	   Selection" the default.

  Inquire On Copy
	   Specifies whether to pop up a dialog that asks the user
	   to confirm that the indicated transfers should take
	   place.

  Inquire On Delete
	   Specifies whether to pop up a dialog that asks the user
	   to confirm that the indicated deletions should take
	   place.

  Inquire On Move
	   Specifies whether to pop up a dialog that asks the user
	   to confirm that the indicated moves should take place.

  Inquire On Quote
	   Specifies whether to pop up a dialog that asks the user
	   to confirm that the indicated commands should be sent.

  Left Auto Local Login
	   Specifies whether to automatically connect the left
	   side to the local (client) host upon starting <EM>LLNL</EM>
	   <EM>XFTP</EM>.

  Max Ftp Retries
	   Specifies the maximum number of retries <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> will
	   attempt if it receives a response from an FTP server
	   that indicates the desired operation failed because of
	   some temporary condition on the remote host.

  Max Time For Ftp Reply
	   Specifies the maximum time in seconds that <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM>
	   will wait for a response from an FTP server before
	   concluding that the connection has been broken.

  Overwrite Dir On Copy
	   Specifies whether it is okay to overwrite an existing
	   directory when recursively copying another directory by
	   the same name.  If a sink directory is overwritten then
	   none of its subdirectories will be deleted, but new
	   files and subdirectories might be added to it, and some
	   existing files might be replaced.

  Preserve Vms Ver Nums
	   Specifies whether to preserve VMS file version numbers
	   when transferring files from a VMS system.  This is
	   only an issue for those VMS FTP servers that provide
	   numbers (not all do).

  Print Password In Debug
	   Specifies whether to print passwords in the log window
	   when the user preference <EM>Diagnostics</EM> is set to <EM>Debug</EM>.

  Quote Cache Size
	   The number of quoted commands to cache.  The cache is
	   preserved across <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> sessions.

  Quote Placeholder
	   This is used as a placeholder in a quoted command to
	   represent items selected in the directory list.  For
	   example, the quoted command "stage 1 &lt;&gt;" will send a
	   STAGE command to the remote host for each selected
	   item.  The default value is "&lt;&gt;", but the placeholder
	   can be set to any nonnull printable string.

  Recursive Delete Enabled
	   Specifies whether to enable the <EM>Recursively</EM> <EM>Delete</EM>
	   <EM>Selected</EM> <EM>Entry(s)</EM> item in the <EM>Ops</EM> menus.  Choose <EM>No</EM> to
	   help prevent accidental recursive deletions.

  Right Auto Local Login
	   Specifies whether to automatically connect the right
	   side to the local (client) host upon starting <EM>LLNL</EM>
	   <EM>XFTP</EM>.

  Sort Caches
	   Specifies whether to sort (by ASCII-collating sequence)
	   cached items when they are displayed in dialogs.  If
	   <EM>Yes</EM>, then sort.  If <EM>No</EM>, then the most recently
	   referenced items are placed at the top of the list.

  Sort Longs Lists By Date
	   Specifies whether to attempt to sort the "long"
	   directory lists by time modified (with most recent
	   listed first) instead of by name.  The <EM>Yes</EM> option is
	   considered unsafe because some FTP servers to not
	   support this option and may give unpredictable results.
	   (Most UNIX hosts support this option.)

  Store Unique
	   Specifies whether existing sink files are to be renamed
	   before file transfer occurs.  If <EM>Yes</EM> then the existing
	   sink file is typically renamed by appending a "."
	   (period) followed by an integer between 1 and 99.

  Symbols On Dir Entries
	   Specifies whether to append single characters to
	   directory entries in order to distinguish their types.
	   If <EM>Yes(Unsafe)</EM> is chosen, "/" is appended to
	   directories, "*" is appended to executables, "@" is
	   appended to symbolic links, and "=" is appended to
	   AF_UNIX address family sockets.  The "Yes" option is
	   considered to be unsafe because some FTP servers do not
	   support this feature and may give unpredictable
	   results.  (Most UNIX hosts support this option.)
	   Furthermore, if you are referencing a directory or
	   directory entry whose name ends with one of the special
	   characters, you will need to select <EM>No(Safe)</EM>.  When in
	   doubt, select <EM>No(Safe)</EM>.  One further note: use of this
	   feature can dramatically degrade interactivity.

  Use Last Dir At Login
	   Specifies whether to automatically enter the most
	   recently referenced directory after connecting to a
	   host.  If this option is requested, but is not possible
	   to perform (e.g., because the directory no longer
	   exists), an error message will be generated, and your
	   home directory will be entered.  <EM>Note</EM>: This mechanism
	   attempts to enter the last directory referenced on the
	   host, regardless of whether it is another user's
	   directory.

  User Cache Size
	   The number of user names to cache (for remote hosts).
	   The cache is preserved across <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> sessions.

  Wildcard Cache Size
	   The number of wildcard expressions to cache.  The cache
	   is preserved across <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> sessions.

<STRONG>VIEWER</STRONG> <STRONG>PREFERENCES</STRONG>
  Selecting item <EM>Viewer</EM> <EM>Preferences</EM> in the <EM>Options</EM> menu pops
  up a dialog that allows the user to control which file will
  be displayed with which viewer, based on the file extension.

  A file to be viewed is first transferred to a temporary
  directory and then, if necessary, is decompressed.  The file
  extension (e.g., ".gif") is then examined to determine which
  viewer the file is to be displayed in.  There are two types
  of viewers: the viewer built into <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> (which is
  suitable for displaying text files) and external viewers
  (e.g., <EM>emacs</EM> for text and <EM>xv</EM> for graphics).

  Single-click on an entry in the <EM>Extensions</EM> list to place
  that extension and its associated command line into the
  <EM>Extension</EM> and <EM>Viewer</EM> <EM>Command</EM> <EM>Line</EM> text fields, respectively.

  An extension is a file suffix that begins with a period
  (".").  A special entry in the extensions list, "OTHERS"
  represents all files that do not have their extension listed
  (including files with no extensions).

  The pattern "&lt;&gt;" in a command line is a placeholder for the
  name of the file to be viewed.  A blank command line
  indicates that the built-in viewer is to be used.  To add a
  new extension to the list, fill in the <EM>Extension</EM> and <EM>Viewer</EM>
  <EM>Command</EM> <EM>Line</EM> text fields and press the <EM>Add</EM> button.  If the
  text in <EM>Extension</EM> does not begin with a period, one will be
  added.  If the extension is already in the list, it will be
  replaced.

  To replace the command line associated with an extension,
  (1) single-click on the list item to select it, (2) edit the
  command line, and (3) press the <EM>Replace</EM> button.

  To delete an extension from the list, single-click on the
  list item to select it and then press the <EM>Delete</EM> button.
  The "OTHERS" entry cannot be deleted (but it's command line
  can be replaced).

  Click the <EM>Apply</EM> button to cause the new changes to take
  effect.  The <EM>OK</EM> button has the same effect as <EM>Apply</EM>, but the
  dialog is also closed.  The <EM>Cancel</EM> button undoes the changes
  made since <EM>OK</EM> or <EM>Apply</EM> were last pressed.

  The viewer preferences can be preserved across <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM>
  sessions in a text file named ".xftpview" in the user's home
  directory (select <EM>Save</EM> <EM>Preferences</EM> in the main window's
  <EM>Options</EM> menu).

<STRONG>LIMITATIONS</STRONG>
  Here are some things to watch out for:

  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> might not work with some old X servers.  For
  example, some older OpenWindows servers might dump core.
  MacX fans should use nothing older than version 1.1.7b.

  Old, buggy versions of Motif can cause weirdness.

  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XFTP</EM> might not work correctly with some non-Unix FTP
  servers.  (If you can give us temporary access to such a
  server, we might be able to fix the problem.)

  Out-of-spec FTP servers can cause untold grief.  (Most
  Unix-based servers work correctly.)

  Third-party file transfers will not work unless at least one
  of the remote FTP servers supports the PASV (passive)
  command.

<STRONG>FILES</STRONG>
  $HOME/.xftpcache   cache file
  $HOME/.xftprc      user preferences
  $HOME/.xftpview    viewer preferences
  XFtp               application defaults file
