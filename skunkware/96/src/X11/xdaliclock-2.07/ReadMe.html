<STRONG>NAME</STRONG>
xdaliclock - melting digital clock

<STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>
<STRONG>xdaliclock</STRONG> [-<EM>toolkitoption</EM> ...] [-<EM>option</EM> ...]

<STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
The <EM>xdaliclock</EM> program displays a digital clock; when a
digit changes, it ``melts'' into its new shape.

This program was inspired by the Alto and Macintosh programs
of the same name, written by Steve Capps in 1983 or 1984.

<STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
<EM>xdaliclock</EM> accepts all of the standard toolkit options, and
also accepts the following options:

<STRONG>-help</STRONG>   Print a brief summary of the allowed options on the
	  standard error output.

<STRONG>-12</STRONG>     Use a twelve hour clock.

<STRONG>-24</STRONG>     Use a twenty-four hour clock.

<STRONG>-seconds</STRONG>
	  Update every second.

<STRONG>-noseconds</STRONG>
	  Update once per minute; don't display seconds at
	  all.

<STRONG>-cycle</STRONG>  Do color-cycling.

<STRONG>-nocycle</STRONG>
	  Don't do color-cycling.

<STRONG>-visual</STRONG> <EM>visual</EM>
	  Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are:

	  <STRONG>best</STRONG>    Use the visual which supports the most
			  writable color cells; this is the default.

	  <STRONG>default</STRONG> Use the screen's default visual (the visual
			  of the root window.)  This is not
			  necessarily the most colorful visual, which
			  is why it is not the default.

	  <EM>class</EM>   One of <STRONG>StaticGray</STRONG>, <STRONG>StaticColor</STRONG>, <STRONG>TrueColor</STRONG>,
			  <STRONG>GrayScale</STRONG>, <STRONG>PseudoColor</STRONG>, or <STRONG>DirectColor</STRONG>.
			  Selects the deepest visual of the given
			  class.

	  <EM>number</EM>  A number (decimal or hex) is interpreted as
			  a visual id number, as reported by the
			  <STRONG>xdpyinfo</STRONG>(1) program; in this way you can
			  select a shallower visual if desired.

<STRONG>-shape</STRONG>  Use the Shape Extension, if it's available, to make
	  the window background be transparent.

	  This doesn't interact terribly well with the <EM>twm</EM> or
	  <EM>tvtwm</EM> window managers, unless they have been
	  configured to not put a titlebar on the <EM>xdaliclock</EM>
	  window.  If this isn't specified in your .<EM>twmrc</EM> or
	  .<EM>tvtwmrc</EM> file, then the window will flicker
	  constantly, as the window manager tries to add and
	  remove the titlebar ten times each second.

	  Also, this turns most X servers into huge cycle
	  hogs.  This is probably because of inefficient
	  implementations of the Shape extension.

<STRONG>-noshape</STRONG>
	  Don't use the Shape Extension.

<STRONG>-memory</STRONG> <STRONG>low</STRONG>
	  Use high-bandwidth, low-memory mode.  If you have a
	  very fast connection between the machine this
	  program is running on and the X server it is
	  displaying on, then <EM>xdaliclock</EM> can work correctly by
	  simply making the drawing requests it needs when it
	  needs them.  This is <EM>the</EM> <EM>elegant</EM> <EM>method</EM>.  However,
	  the amount of data necessary to animate the display
	  ends up being a bit over 10 kilobytes worth of X
	  Protocol per second.  On a fast machine with a local
	  display, or over a fast network, that's almost
	  negligible, but (for example) an NCD X Terminal at
	  38.4 kilobaud can't keep up.  That is the reason
	  for:

<STRONG>-memory</STRONG> <STRONG>medium</STRONG>
	  Use high-memory, low-bandwidth mode.  In this mode,
	  <EM>xdaliclock</EM> precomputes most of the frames that it
	  will ever need.  This is <EM>the</EM> <EM>sleazy</EM> <EM>copout</EM> <EM>method</EM>.
	  The bandwidth requirements are drastically reduced,
	  because instead of telling the server what bits to
	  draw where, it merely tells it what pixmaps to copy
	  into the window.  Aside from the fact that I
	  consider this to be <EM>cheating</EM>, the only downside of
	  this method is that those pixmaps (about 170 of
	  them, each the size of one character) are consuming
	  server-memory.  This probably isn't a very big deal,
	  unless you're using an exceptionally large font.

<STRONG>-memory</STRONG> <STRONG>high</STRONG>
	  With <EM>memory</EM> set to <EM>high</EM>, the cache is twice as large
	  (the <STRONG>n</STRONG> -&gt; <STRONG>n</STRONG>+<STRONG>2</STRONG> transitions are cached as well as the
	  <STRONG>n</STRONG> -&gt; <STRONG>n</STRONG>+<STRONG>1</STRONG> ones).  Even with memory set to <EM>medium</EM>,
	  this program can seem sluggish when using the
	  builtin font over a very slow connection to the
	  display server.

<STRONG>-font</STRONG> <EM>fontname</EM>
	  Specifies the X font to use; <EM>xdaliclock</EM> can
	  correctly animate any font that contains all the
	  digits plus colon and slash, and in which the
	  letters aren't excessively curly.

	  The <EM>xdaliclock</EM> program contains a pair of builtin
	  bitmapped fonts, which are larger and more
	  attractive than the standard X fonts.  One of these
	  fonts will be used if the -<EM>font</EM> option is given one
	  of the fontnames <STRONG>BUILTIN</STRONG> or <STRONG>BUILTIN2</STRONG>.

<STRONG>-builtin</STRONG>
	  This is the same as specifying -<EM>font</EM> <EM>BUILTIN</EM>.

<STRONG>-builtin2</STRONG>
	  This is the same as specifying -<EM>font</EM> <EM>BUILTIN2</EM>.

<STRONG>-fullscreen</STRONG>
	  Make the window take up the whole screen.  When
	  -<EM>fullscreen</EM> is specified, the displayed time will
	  wander around a little, to prevent any pixels from
	  being on continuously and causing phosphor burn-in.

<STRONG>-root</STRONG>   Display the clock on the root window instead of in
	  its own window.  This makes the digits wander around
	  too.

The following standard X Toolkit command line arguments are
commonly used with <EM>xdaliclock</EM>:

<STRONG>-display</STRONG> <EM>host</EM>:<EM>dpy</EM>
	  This option specifies the X server to contact.

<STRONG>-geometry</STRONG> <EM>geometry</EM>
	  This option specifies the prefered size and position
	  of the clock window.

<STRONG>-bg</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
	  This option specifies the color to use for the
	  background of the window.  The default is ``white.''

<STRONG>-fg</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
	  This option specifies the color to use for the
	  foreground of the window.  The default is ``black.''

<STRONG>-bd</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
	  This option specifies the color to use for the
	  border of the window.  The default is the same as
	  the foreground color.

<STRONG>-rv</STRONG>     This option indicates that reverse video should be
	  simulated by swapping the foreground and background
	  colors.

<STRONG>-bw</STRONG> <EM>number</EM>
	  This option specifies the width in pixels of the
	  border surrounding the window.

<STRONG>-xrm</STRONG> <EM>resourcestring</EM>
	  This option specifies a resource string to be used.

<STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG>
Clicking and holding any mouse button in the <EM>xdaliclock</EM>
window will cause it to display the date while the button is
held.

Typing ``space'' at the <EM>xdaliclock</EM> window will toggle
between a twelve hour and twenty-four hour display.

Typing ``q'' or ``C-c'' at the window quits.

If the <EM>xdaliclock</EM> window is iconified or otherwise unmapped,
it will go to sleep until it is mapped again.

<STRONG>X</STRONG> <STRONG>DEFAULTS</STRONG>
As distributed in <B>SCO Skunkware 96</B>, the <EM>xdaliclock</EM> resource
file <I>/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XDaliClock</I> contains the following :
<PRE>

XDaliClock*geometry: -20-10
XDaliClock*shape: True
XDaliClock*cycle: True
XDaliClock*memory: Low
XDaliClock*font: BUILTIN
! Put one or both of the following in your $HOME/.Xdefaults file
! to get rid of the title bar and borders the window manager puts
! on xdaliclock. This makes the flashing go away and looks cleaner.
! After doing so, you will need to restart the window manager.
!
! *XDaliClock.clientDecoration: -all
! *XDaliClock.clientDecoration: none
</PRE>
<EM>xdaliclock</EM> understands all of the core resource names and
classes as well as:

<STRONG>seconds</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>Seconds)</STRONG>
	  Whether to display seconds.  If true, this is the
	  same as the -<EM>seconds</EM> command line argument; if
	  false, this is the same as -<EM>noseconds</EM>.

<STRONG>cycle</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>Cycle)</STRONG>
	  Whether to do color cycling.  If true, this is the
	  same as the -<EM>cycle</EM> command line argument; if false,
	  this is the same as -<EM>nocycle</EM>.

<STRONG>shape</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>Shape)</STRONG>
	  Whether to use the Shape Extension, if available.
	  If true, this is the same as the -<EM>shape</EM> command line
	  argument; if false, this is the same as -<EM>noshape</EM>.

<STRONG>memory</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>Memory)</STRONG>
	  This must be <EM>high</EM>, <EM>medium</EM>, or <EM>low</EM>, the same as the
	  -<EM>memory</EM> command-line option.

<STRONG>font</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>Font)</STRONG>
	  The same as the -<EM>font</EM> command line option: the font
	  to melt.  If this is the string <STRONG>BUILTIN</STRONG>, then the
	  large builtin font is used.  If this is the string
	  <STRONG>BUILTIN2</STRONG>, then the <EM>even</EM> <EM>larger</EM> builtin font is used.
	  Otherwise, this must be the name of a valid X font.

<STRONG>mode</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>Mode)</STRONG>
	  Whether to display 12-hour or 24-hour time.  If <STRONG>12</STRONG>,
	  this is the same as the -<EM>12</EM> command line argument;
	  if <STRONG>24</STRONG>, this is the same as -<EM>24</EM>.

<STRONG>datemode</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>DateMode)</STRONG>
	  Specifies how the date should be printed when a
	  mouse button is held down.  This may be one of the
	  strings <STRONG>mm/dd/yy</STRONG>, <STRONG>dd/mm/yy</STRONG>, <STRONG>yy/mm/dd</STRONG>, <STRONG>yy/dd/mm</STRONG>,
	  <STRONG>mm/yy/dd</STRONG>, or <STRONG>dd/yy/mm</STRONG>.  The default is <STRONG>mm/dd/yy</STRONG>.  If
	  seconds are not being displayed, then only the first
	  four digits will ever be displayed (<STRONG>mm/dd</STRONG> instead of
	  <STRONG>mm/dd/yy</STRONG>, for example.)

<STRONG>fullScreen</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>FullScreen)</STRONG>
	  The same as the -<EM>fullscreen</EM> command-line option.

<STRONG>root</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>Root)</STRONG>
	  The same as the -<EM>root</EM> command-line option.

<STRONG>visualID</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG>class <STRONG>VisualID)</STRONG>
	  The same as the -<EM>visual</EM> command-line option.

<STRONG>ENVIRONMENT</STRONG>
<STRONG>DISPLAY</STRONG>
  to get the default host and display number.

<STRONG>XENVIRONMENT</STRONG>
  to get the name of a resource file that overrides the
  global resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER
  property.

<STRONG>TZ</STRONG>  to get the current time zone.  If you want to force the
  clock to display some other time zone, set this variable
  before starting it.  For example:

	   $ TZ=GMT0 xdaliclock
	   % ( setenv TZ PST8PDT ; xdaliclock )

  You may notice that the format of the TZ variable (which
  is used by the C library <STRONG>ctime</STRONG>(3) and <STRONG>localtime</STRONG>(3)
  routines) is not actually documented anywhere.  The
  fourth character (the digit) is the only thing that
  really matters: it is the offset in hours from GMT.  The
  first three characters are ignored.  The last three
  characters are used to flag daylight savings time: their
  presence effectively adds 1 to the zone offset.  (I am
  not making this up...)

<STRONG>SEE</STRONG> <STRONG>ALSO</STRONG>
<STRONG>X</STRONG>(1), <STRONG>xrdb</STRONG>(1), <STRONG>xlsfonts</STRONG>(1), <STRONG>xclock</STRONG>(1), <STRONG>dclock</STRONG>(1), <STRONG>oclock</STRONG>(1),
<STRONG>tclock</STRONG>(1), <STRONG>xscreensaver</STRONG>(1)

<STRONG>BUGS</STRONG>
Other system load will sometimes cause the second-display to
increment by more than one second at a time, in order to
remain synchronized to the current time.

The -<EM>memory</EM> option is disgusting and shouldn't be necessary,
but I'm not clever enough to eliminate it.  It has been said
that hacking graphics in X is like finding <EM>sqrt(pi)</EM> with
roman numerals.

When using a small font (less than 48x56 or so) it's
possible that shipping a bitmap to the server would be more
efficient than sending a DrawSegments request (since the
endpoints are specified using 16 bits each, when all that we
really need is 6 or 7 bits.)

Support for the Shared Memory Extension would be a good
thing.

It should display the day of the week somewhere.

The color cycling should be less predictable; it should vary
saturation and intensity as well, and should be more careful
that foreground and background contrast well.

Should have a -<EM>analog</EM> mode (maybe someday...)

Please let me know if you find any bugs or make any
improvements.

Thanks to Ephraim Vishniac &lt;ephraim@think.com&gt; for
explaining the format of the bitmap resources in the
Macintosh version of this, so that I could snarf them for
the -<EM>builtin</EM> fonts.

And thanks to Steve Capps for the really great idea.
