NOTE: XAnim 2.70.6 OR GREATER IS REQUIRED FOR Creative CYUV SUPPORT!!!

These modules will add AVI support for the following Video Codecs:

            + Creative CYUV     (CYUV)      depth 16

CYUV support for XAnim is being provided as an optional machine
specific object module that is linked into XAnim at compile time.

 1) The first step is figuring out which XAnim CYUV decompression
    library module you need to obtain for your machine.

    Below is a table that matches your machine/OS to which library
    you need to download(ok, they're really object files).

    yeah, I know it's a short list, but these are the only machines
    that I have physical access to or cross-compilers for.

    NOTE: SunOS 4.1.3 uses AOUT and Sun Solaris used ELF. They're not
    compatible.

    NOTE: If your machine is not supported, it's because I don't have physical
    access to that type of machine. There are a handful of options
    available to you(not all of them may be feasible)

        a) Permanently loan me that type of machine so that I may
           compile a library module for that machine type. Please
           contact me first and yes, I'd be surprised if someone
           chose this option. :^) 

        b) Send me a cross-compiler for your machine type. Must
           be a Sparc SunOS 4.1.x executable or more specifically
           it must run on my machine.  I'll do the compile and then
           you'll need to verify that the resulting library module
           works on your machine.

	   Yes, I know gcc can be a cross-compiler. No, I don't currently
	   have the time to setup it up for all the various platforms.
           
     Since I'm not allowed to distribute the source code I can't login
     to an account on a remote machine in order to do the compile.

     Also, I personally can't give you a non-disclosure. You need
     to contact Creative about licensing CYUV.

 2) Obtaining the object files. Follow the steps below:

	1) cd into the XAnim directory on your machine
	2) ftp ftp.portal.com     OR  ftp 156.151.3.4
	3) user is "anonymous"
	4) passwd is your email address
	5) "type binary"			VERY IMPORTANT
	6) "cd /pub/podlipec/creative
	7) "get LIB_NAME.Z"			NOTE: the .Z at the end
	8) "quit"

    NOTE: LIB_NAME is obtained from the table in section 1 based
     on the type of machine and OS you are running. If you don't
     know, contact your system administrator or a coworker who
     does know. 

 3) "uncompress LIB_NAME.Z"

     This will create LIB_NAME from LIB_NAME.Z

 4) Edit Section III of either your Imakefile or Makefile(derived
    from Makefile.unx).  If you are not sure which one to
    use then read the compile.help that came with xanim.
      
    a) In Section III of either the Imakefile or Makefile

       Uncomment out the following define:

         XA_CYUV_DEF = -DXA_CYUV

      and add LIB_NAME to the XA_CYUV_LIB define. For example
      if you have Sun Sparc running SunOS 4.1.3 then you would
      use the following:

        XA_CYUV_LIB = xa1.0_cyuv_sparcCOFF.o

      For other machine/OS types, use the approriate xa1.0_cyuv_*.o file
      listed in the table at the top of this readme.

      NOTE:  There is no "-" or anything other prefix. Just the object 
             file name.

    b) If and ONLY if you are using the Imakefile(in other
       words DON'T do this if you are using the Makefile(derived
       from Makefile.unx)) then do the following:

	  "xmkmf" 
   
    c) Now(regardless of which makefile)

	  "touch xanim.h" 
	  "make xanim"
 
    NOTE: make sure you see -DXA_CYUV on the compile command lines
    and make sure both xa_avi.c and xa_qt.c get recompiled.
   
 5)  Have fun. :^)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES on how XAnim options affect CYUV on 8 bit Color displays/visuals.

None of these options matter on monochrome/TrueColor/DirectColor displays
and visuals.

  With no options, XAnim will create a 256 entry RGB332 colormap
  and dither to that. 

     xanim  free_fall.avi

  -F will turn off this dithering and XAnim will instead truncate
  the 24bit RGB values down to the RGB332 colormap.(I see no real
  advantage to this, which is why +F is on by default)

     xanim  -F free_fall.avi

  The +CF4 option will TURN OFF the dithering by default. +CF4 causes
   XAnim to scan the animation ahead of time and the select the
   "best" 256 colors from the possible thousands sampled. These colors
   may be further reduced depending on how many colors are still 
   available(ie not in use by other X11 applications).

     xanim +CF4 free_fall.avi

  If you specify +F AFTER the +CF4 option, dithering will be used
  with the +CF4 option.

     xanim +CF4 +F free_fall.avi
 

  The -Cn option may be used with all of the above examples. -Cn tells
   XAnim to create it's own colormap, giving it FULL USE of those
   256 colors. Please note that it is up to your X11 Window Manager(NOT
   XAnim) to install this colormap based on which window the Color Focus
   is on. Normally, Color Focus follows the mouse pointer, but not
   always.


      xanim -Cn free_fall.avi

      xanim -Cn +CF4 free_fall.avi
