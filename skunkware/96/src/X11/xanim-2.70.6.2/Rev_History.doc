TBD work prior revision history back in.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO (not in any specific order)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ add support for QT movies with resource headers up front.
          This is needed to support QT streaming.
	+ Add playback as file downloads for AVI and FLI files.
	+ Some reports of incorrect colors on depth 16 and 24
          displays. Haven't been able to recreate yet. Suspect
	  it's correct behaviour/colormap switching.
	+ Redo audio API to allow for greater flexibilty.
	+ Add audio conversion routines to output stereo sound.
	+ Improved GUI (see Petunia in 2.70.5)
	    + toggle for internal/headphones/lineout
	    + scrollbar for video frame #
	+ Make use of X11 resources
	+ MPEG Type P and Type B frame support
	+ Specify alternative X11 Window to play animation into.
	+ Enable more formats to be supported by serial streams.
	  (like JPEG, MPEG, etc). 
	+ add +f option for GIF images.
	+ Break up large audio chunks into smaller chunks. This is
           important when +f option is used, since it reads each
           chunk as needed. Not useful if entire file is one chunk
	   as it is with WAV files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.6.2  (06Jun96)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ CVID:  broke grayscale cvid animations. If you already
		 have 27061 then edit "xa_qt.c" and change line 1127 from: 
		   ---
		    }
		   ---
	         to be: 
		   ---
		    }
		    if (qt->depth == 40) qt->depth = 8;
		   ---
	         and recompile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.6.1  (05Jun96)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ KPCD:  Fixed Minor warning that some fanatical compilers
                 considered an error. :^)   No reason to upgrade
                 to this is you can compile 2.70.6

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.6  (04Jun96)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ REMOTE:  Petunia volume scrollbar is now settable with mouse.
	+ REMOTE:  -Zr wasn't working with Petunia.
	+ REMOTE:  some compile errors when compiling with no remote control.
	+ AVI:     hooks for Creative CYUV Video Codec added. 
			see creative.readme for instructions.
	+ AVI:     Added support for WHAM video codec(same as CRAM).
	+ QT:	   Added support for Kodak Photo CD Video Codec.
	+ QT:	   Added support for RAW depth 1 Video Codec
	+ QT:	   Added support for RLE depth 4 Video Codec
	+ QT:	   Added support for Microsoft Video 1 Video Codec.
	+WAV:	   large audio chunks are broken into smaller chunks
		   artificially by xanim to improve +f memory usage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.5.4 (01May96)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ Okay, I screwed up. I had changed over to long ints. Big
          mistake. Changing back. This won't affect machines with 32
          data paths. Alpha users need to revert back to the xa2.0_
          decompression modules.

	+ AUDIO: Fixed bug where audio_ring can occasionally get out
                 of sync between the update and the audio_out pointers.
       

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.5.3 (28Apr96)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ This is just a clean up release. Fixed all the "gcc -Wall"
          warnings on both linux and SunOS 4.1.3 machines.
          Some of these warnings were(or were treated) as compile 
	  errors on SGI and Alpha machines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.5.2 (19Apr96)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ MPG: fixed a bug when allocating MPG buffers if the height 
	       was greater than the width.

	+ FLI: fixed a bug introduced in 27051 that affects some FLIs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.5.1 (12Apr96)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ AUD:  with the +f option, stopping moving restarting  or
	        playing backward then forwards could occasionally
		break audio. Now fixed. This bug was recently
	 	introduced, but not sure when.

	+ AVI:	added +F dithering support to CRAM16 Video Codec.

	+ BUG:  fixed bug in 2x2 dithering used by Cinepak. 
	        Was introduced in 2705 as I tried to improved the dithering.
                This caused potential core dumps.

	+ HPDEV:  setting sampling rate occasionally failed because 
	          /dev/audio reported it was busy. Now loop on that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.5 (04Apr96)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ AVI:     fixed Ultimotion bug with 16/24 depth displays.
		   I didn't correct generate the correct colors. 

	+ WIDGETS: I'm starting to do my own GUI. Eventually, I will
                   no longer support Athena, Athena3d or Motif.
                   Quite frankly, it's been a pain trying to support
                   them with all sorts of library, include, portability
		   and installation problems.  

		   Use XA_REMOTE_DEFS = -DXA_PETUNIA instead. Not saying
		   it's better, just more portable across the X11
                   platforms and less bothersome(to me). Also, it's the
		   only GUI I plan on support and improving on now.
		   Constructive feedback welcome.

	+ QT:   added YUV2 support for depth 16 and 24 Displays.
	+ MOVI: added display depth > 8 support to MVC1 video codec.
	+ MOVI: added +F dithering to MVC1 video codec.
		This slows it down considerably. So use -F to turn off
		or +CF4 as an alternative method. Will try to optimize
		later.
	+ AVI:  added support for RGB depth  4 Video Codec
	+ AVI:  added support for RGB depth 16 Video Codec
	+ IFF:  fixed compile error with fprintf statements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.4.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ removed erroneous "static" from the xa_wav.c and xa_avi.c 
	  files. Caused compile errors with some compilers.
	+ Redid how audio-only files are merged with video files.
	  See the "+Am" and the "+AM" options in the xanim.read
	  or the xanim.man files.
	+ AUDIO: with audio only files, you know have 100ms resolution
	  for single stepping through that file. 
	+ AVI: Added support for audio only AVI files.
	+ QT:  Added support for audio only QT files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.4.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ Replaced bcopy with memcpy for those machines without bcopy.
	+ QT: Added dithering to RPZA Video Codec(makes it twice as slow).
	   use the +F or -F option to turn it on or off respectively.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.4.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
        + Bug fix for machines without audio.
          I tested it, I fixed something else and broke it. argh. :^)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ video/audio sync fixed. Was broken in 2.70.3(actually it was
           only partially implemented after a change I did).
	+ QT: IMA4 audio codec, mono/stereo added.
	+ QT: fixed bug that caused lack of sync with some animations.
	  Had to do with incorrectly determining frame timing.
	+ QT: fixed RLE8 bug that caused trailers.
	+ QT: fixed YUV2 bug.
	+ JPEG: fixed bug in 21_11_11 JPEG files with depth 16 and 24 displays.
          Caused core dumps.
	+ JPEG: fixed bug that caused corruption with some images.
	+ JPEG: added support for 41_11_11 images/anims.
	+ MPEG: fixed bug that caused corruption with some newer
	  mpegs. NOTE: XAnim doesn't suport mpeg files with interleaved
          audio yet.
	+ AVI: XAnim now used AVI IDX1 chunk if present instead of scanning
          the entire AVI file. If AVI file is truncated or coming in
          from a serial stream, then it defaults back to scanning.
	  This greatly speeds up CDROM reading with +f option.
	+ AVI/WAV: added MSADPCM stereo audio support.
	+ AVI/WAV: added DVI/IMA mono/stereo audio support.
	  NOTE: both old and new DVI formats supported. User needs to
           use "+k2" option with old DVI format. Only way to tell is
           if it sounds "bad" and "+k2" fixes it. Whadda pain.
	+ SGI Movie format support added. Just JPEG and MVC1 Video codecs.
          MVC2 not yet supported.
	+ stdin input for the following formats *ONLY*: 
		AVI, FLI, FLC, DL, GIF, IFF, Movie_Setters and RLE
	+ ftp input for the following formats *ONLY*: 
		AVI, FLI, FLC, DL, GIF, IFF, Movie_Setters and RLE
          Still needs to load entire file.  User needs to define
          XANIM_USER and XANIM_PASSWD env variables. Typically
          anonymous and user's email address are used.
	+ Audio Conversion routines rewritten to improve freq conversion.
	+ -DXA_FORK define no longer needed.
	+ HP: HP Audio SUPPORT IS BROKEN IN 2.70.4. Use HPDEV instead.
	  will hopefully be fixed.
	+ -Ae option to turn off audio wasn't working. fixed.
	+ Probably a lot of other stuff I forgot about.
