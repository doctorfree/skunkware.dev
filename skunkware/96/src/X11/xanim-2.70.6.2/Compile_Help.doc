         Compiling the Audio Revisions of XAnim(2.70.* and up)

In the following help section,  the "27062" part is variable and
depends on the revision(in this case Rev 2.70.6.2). 
Another example: Rev 2.88.3 would be "2883".

Section I    Obtaining XAnim
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Obtaining the XAnim archive through ftp:
	1) ftp ftp.shell.portal.com
	2) Enter "anonymous" as user(don't include quotes)
	3) Enter your full email address as the password.
	4) "cd /pub/podlipec"
	5) "type binary"
        6a) "get xanim27062.tar.Z"     For the unix compressed version
                OR
        6b) "get xanim27062.tar.gz"    For the gnu zipped version
	7) by

Obtaining XAnim through mosaic or a browser:
  If you obtained the xanim archive through mosaic or another www browser,
  then you need to be aware of whether or not it was automatically
  uncompressed as it was transferred. Different browsers do different things.

	A) If your browser uncompressed XAnim then save the file
	   as "xanim27062.tar" and skip the uncompress steps in
	   sections I) or II).
	B) If your browers didn't uncompress XAnim then save the file
	   as "xanim27062.tar.Z".
        C) If you're not sure then: 
	     1) save the file as "xanim27062"
             2) "ls -l xanim27062"
                 a) if the size is < 600K, then it's compressed and you
		    should "mv xanim27062 xanim27062.tar.Z".
	         b) else it's not compressed and you should
		    "mv xanim27062 xanim27062.tar". NOTE: skip the
		    uncompress steps below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section II    Unarchiving
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1a) uncompress xanim27062.tar.Z    For the unix compressed version
               OR
    1b) gunzip xanim27062.tar.gz       For the gnu zipped version
    2) tar xvof xanim27062.tar
    3) cd xanim27062

Section III   Compiling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that you've got it, what do you do?  

Part A) 
   If you are using OpenWindows(with SunOS 4.1.3) goto Part B. 
   OpenWindows with SunOS 5.x should be okay here, but not positive.
   If you know that Imake is NOT setup on your system, goto Part B.
   If you're not sure about Imake, try it anyways and on any failure
   goto Part B and skip any initial steps you've already done.
   
    1) Read and edit the Imakefile. Visit each section and
       follow the directions for your machine/OS/Windowing environment.
    2) xmkmf
    3) make xanim

    If steps 2) or 3) failed, then your system most likely isn't setup up
    properly for Imake(xmkmf). Either talk to your System Administrator 
    or goto Part B.


Part B)
    IF  Part A ABOVE FAILED, OR Imake ISN'T PROPERLY SETUP OR YOU'RE USING
    Sun OpenWindows INSTEAD OF X11

    1) cp Makefile.unx Makefile
    2) Edit the Makefile and: 
          a) indicate which XA_AUDIO_DEFS/LIBS/etc is correct for you
	     machine and OS.
	  b) Indicate whether you wish to use Athena, Athena 3d or Motif
             Widgets for the Remote Control window.(XA_REMOTE_DEFS/INCS/etc)
	     NOTE: You need the Motif library in order to compile XAnim
             for Motif. Check to make sure you have the libXm.* library
             in your X11 libs diretory before selecting Motif.
	  c) Indicate where the X11 includes are on your machine(INCLUDE)
	  d) Indicate where the X11 libs are on your machine(LIBS)
          e) If you're using OpenWindows, follow the directions at the
             top of the Makefile to work around the bugs in OpenWindows.
    3) On Suns you need to have your LD_LIBRARY_PATH match the XLIBDIR
       define inside the Makefile. If it doesn't, you might end up mismatching
       different revs of X11 includes and libraries, causing all sorts of
       failures(usually undefined symbols). NOTE: This also has to match
       when you try executing XAnim, or it may not be able to find the 
       proper libraries.

	To find out what you LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to: 

        	"env | grep LD"

	The following examples are for OpenWindows(XLIBDIR = /usr/openwin/lib) 
	To set it up properly for OpenWindows in the (C shell):

        	"setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/lib:/usr/openwin/lib"

	To set it up properly for OpenWindows in the (Korn, Bourne and 
	POSIX shells):

        	"LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/usr/openwin/lib"
        	"export LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

	NOTE: No spaces around "=" sign.

    7) make xanim

    If your not sure where your X11 libs or includes are, your SysAdm should
    know or I can help as well.


Please see the file "Compile_Errs.doc" for a list of common compilation
problems and their solutions.
