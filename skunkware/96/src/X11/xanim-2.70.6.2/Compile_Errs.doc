 This file needs to be updated as time permits. And perhaps areas
 from problems common to specific machines.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) 
 Problem:

     Compiler reports following symbols as undefined
     >   ld: Undefined symbol
     >      _XtStrings
     >      _XtShellStrings

 Possible Reason:  

   Your LD_LIBRARY_PATH doesn't match the XLIBDIR that is in the Makefile. 
   This is because you're using the /usr/openwin/X11/includes, and some
   unrelated X11 library release(usually /usr/lib/X11).


2)
 Problem:

     Compiler reports following symbols as undefined
     > .XShmDetach
     > .XShmPutImage
     > .XShmAttach
     > .XShmCreateImage
     > .XShmQueryExtension
     > compile FAILED.

 Probable Reason: 

   Your machine doesn't support X11 Shared Memory Extension.
     
   These are all X11 Shared memory extensions and NOT all machines
   supports them.  So, you'll want to edit Imakefile or Makefile and
   comment out the following line:

   XA_SHARED = -DXSHM

   If you're using Imakfile you need to "xmkmf" and "make xanim"
   or if you're using Makefile.unx, just "make xanim".

3) 
 Problem:

     Compiler reports following symbols as undefined

     ld: Undefined symbol
        _get_wmShellWidgetClass
        _get_applicationShellWidgetClass


 Probable Reason:  

     Certain revs of the OpenWindow's shared libXmu.a are missing
     those symbols. The solution is the use the Makefile.unx and
     use the following for the XA_REMOTE_LIBS:

     XA_REMOTE_LIBS = -lXaw /usr/openwin/lib/libXmu.a

     The static libXmu.a library has these symbols defined.

4)
 Problem:

     Compiler reports the following:

     ld: fatal: library -l/usr/openwin/lib/libXmu.a: not found

 Reason:

     XA_REMOTE_LIBS is using "-l/usr/openwin/lib/libXmu.a" instead
     of "/usr/openwin/lib/libXmu.a". The "-l" should be removed.

     
5)
 Problem:

     Compiler reports following symbols as undefined
         _gethostname   (first ref`d in /usr/openwin/lib/libXmu.a)
         _gethostbyname 

 Reason: 

    You are using Solaris/SunOS 5.x and the -lnsl -lsockets haven't
    been included in the link phase.  Use the Makefile.unx and
    uncomment out the following line:

    XA_SOLARIS_LIBS = -lsocket -lnsl

    and the recompile.
 
5)
 Problem:

     Compiler reports following symbols as undefined
         _Xm*

 Reason:

    You have set the XA_REMOTE_* to use Motif and your system doesn't
    have the Motif library(libXm.a).  Talk to your sysadm about getting
    the Motif library OR use the Athena Widgets instead. The Athena
    widgets are the default X11 widgets. Motif you pay extra for.

6)
 Problem:  

    Compiler reports the following on HP machines:

     anyfilename: too much defining - use -H option
     anyfilename: no space

    The solution is uncomment out the following line in the Makefile

     XA_HPUX_DEFS = -Wp,-H150000

    and then recompile
