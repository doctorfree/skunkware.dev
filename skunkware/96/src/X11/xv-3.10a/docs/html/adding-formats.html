<H1>Adding Other Image Formats to <I>xv</I></H1>
<P>This appendix is split up into two sections, one for reading a new file 
format, and the other for writing a
new file format.  Note that you do not necessarily have to read  <I>and</I> write a 
new file format.  For example,
 <I>xv</I> can read PCX files, but it doesn't write them.  Likewise,  <I>xv</I> 
traditionally could only write PostScript
files, but couldn't read them.  (And technically, it still doesn't.)</P>
<P>For the purposes of this example, I'll be talking about the PBM/PGM/PPM 
code specifically.  (See the file
 <TT>xvpbm.c</TT>
 for full details.)</P>
<A NAME="writing-code-reading-new-file-format"><H2>  Writing Code for Reading a New File Format</H2></A>
<P>Note:  Despite the wide variety of displays and file formats  <I>xv</I>
 can deal with, internally it only manipulates
8-bit colormapped images or 24-bit RGB images.  If you're loading an 8-bit colormapped 
image, such as a
GIF image, no problem.  If you're loading an 8-or-fewer-bits format that doesn't 
have a colormap (such as
an 8-bit greyscale image, or a 1-bit B/W bitmap) your 
 <TT>Load</TT>
() routine will have to generate an appropriate
colormap.</P>
<P>Make a copy of 
 <TT>xvpbm.c</TT>
, calling it something appropriate.  For the rest of this appendix, mentally
replace the string '
 <TT>xvpbm.c</TT>
' with the name of your new file.</P>
<P>Edit the 
 <TT>Makefile</TT>
 and/or the 
 <TT>Imakefile</TT>
 so that your new module will be compiled.  In the
 <TT>Makefile</TT>
, add "
 <TT>xvpbm.o</TT>
" to the "
 <TT>OBJS = ...</TT>
" macro definition.  In the 
 <TT>Imakefile</TT>
, add
"
 <TT>xvpbm.o</TT>
" to the end of the "
 <TT>OBJS1 = ...</TT>
" macro definition, and "
 <TT>xvpbm.c"</TT>
 to the end of the
 <TT>"SRCS1 = ..."</TT>
 macro definition.</P>
<P>Edit the new module.</P>
<P>You'll need to 
 <TT>#include "xv.h"</TT>
, of course.</P>
<P>The module should have one externally callable function that does the work 
of loading up the file.  The
function is called with two arguments, a  <I>filename</I>
 to load, and a pointer to a 
 <TT>PICINFO</TT>
 structure, like so:</P>
<PRE>/*******************************************/
int LoadPBM(fname, pinfo)
char *fname;   PICINFO *pinfo;
/*******************************************/</PRE>
<P>The file name will be the complete file name (absolute, not relative to any 
directory).  Note:  if  <I>xv</I> is
reading from 
 <TT>stdin</TT>
, don't worry about it.  
 <TT>stdin</TT>
 is always automatically copied to a temporary file.
The same goes for pipes and compressed files.  Your 
 <TT>Load()</TT>
 routine is guaranteed that it will be reading
from a real file that appears to be in your file format, not a stream.  
This lets you use routines such as
 <TT>fseek()</TT>
, and such.</P>
<P>The 
 <TT>pinfo</TT>
 argument is a pointer to a 
 <TT>PICINFO</TT>
 structure.  This structure is used to hold the complete set
of information associated with the image that will be loaded.  When your 
 <TT>Load()</TT>
 routine is called, the
fields in this structure will all be zeroed-out.  It is your function's 
responsibility to load up the structure
appropriately, and completely.  The structure is defined as:</P>
<PRE>/* info structure filled in by the LoadXXX() image reading routines */</TT>
 <TT>typedef struct { byte *pic;                  /* image data */
                 int   w, h;                 /* size */
                 int   type;                 /* PIC8 or PIC24 */
                 byte  r[256],g[256],b[256]; </TT>
 <TT>/* colormap, if PIC8 */
                 int   normw, normh;         /* normal size of image.
                                                normally == w,h except when
                                                doing quick load for icons
*/</TT>
 <TT>                 int   frmType;              /* def. Format type to save in */
                 int   colType;              /* def. Color type to save in */
                 char  fullInfo[128];        /* Format: field in info box */
                 char  shrtInfo[128];        /* short format info */
                 char *comment;              /* comment text */</P>
<P>                 int   numpages;             /* # of page files, if >1 */
                 char  pagebname[64];        /* basename of page files */</TT>
 <TT>} PICINFO;</PRE>
<P>The 
 <TT>Load()</TT>
 function should return '1' on success, '0' on failure.</P>
<P>All other information is communicated using the 
 <TT>PICINFO</TT>
 structure.  The fields should be setup as
follows:</P>
<PRE>byte *pic;</PRE>
<P>This is an array of bytes which holds the returned image.  The array is 
 <TT>malloc()</TT>
'd by the 
 <TT>Load()</TT>
routine.  The array should be 
 <TT>w*h</TT>
 bytes long (for an 8-bit colormapped image) or 
 <TT>w*h*3</TT>
 bytes long (for a
24-bit RGB image).  For an 8-bit image, there is one byte per pixel, which 
serves as an index into the
returned colormap (see below).  For a 24-bit image, there are three bytes 
per pixel, in red, green blue,
order.  In either case, pixels start at the top-left corner, and proceed in 
normal scan-line order.  There is
no padding of any sort at the end of a scan line.</P>
<P> <TT>int w, h;</TT></P>
<P>These variables specify the width and height (in pixels) of the image that has been loaded.</P>
<P> <TT>int type;</TT></P>
<P>This variable is used to tell the calling routine whether the loaded image 
is an 8-bit image or a 24-bit
image.  It  <I>must</I> be set equal to 
 <TT>PIC8</TT>
 or 
 <TT>PIC24</TT>
, whichever one is appropriate.  These constants are
defined in '
 <TT>xv.h</TT>
'.</P>
<P> <TT>byte r[256], g[256], b[256];</TT></P>
<P>If the returned image is an 8-bit image, you must load up these variables 
with the colormap for the image.
A given pixel value in 
 <TT>pic</TT>
 maps to an RGB color through these arrays.  In each array, a value of 0 
means
'off', and a value of 255 means 'fully on'.  Note:  the arrays do not have 
to be completely filled.  Only
RGB entries for pixels that actually exist in 
 <TT>pic</TT>
 need to be set.  For example, if 
 <TT>pic</TT>
 is known to be a
B/W bitmap with pixel values of 0 and 1, you would only have to set entries 
'0' and '1' of the 
 <TT>r,g,b</TT>
arrays.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if the returned image is a 24-bit image, the 
 <TT>r,g,b</TT>
 arrays are ignored, and you do not
have to do anything with them.</P>
<P> <TT>int normw, normh;</TT></P>
<P>These specify the 'normal' size of the image.  Normally, they are equal to 
 <TT>w</TT>
 and 
 <TT>h</TT>
, respectively.  The only
exception is when doing a 'quick' load for icon generation, in which case 
it may be possible to read a
'reduced' version of the image, sufficient for generating the tiny icon 
files.  In such a case, 
 <TT>w</TT>
 and 
 <TT>h</TT>
 would
reflect the (reduced) size of the image returned, and 
 <TT>normw</TT>
 and 
 <TT>normh</TT>
 would reflect the 'normal' image
size, for use in the comments displayed in the  <I>xv visual schnauzer</I>.  
Currently only the 
 <TT>LoadJFIF()</TT>
function in 
 <TT>xvjpeg.c</TT>
 actually does this.
</P>
<P> <TT>int frmType;</TT></P>
<P>This lets you specify the  <I>Format</I> type to automatically select when you 
 <B>Save</B>
 a file.  As such, this is only
relevant if you intend to have  <I>xv</I> write your image format as well as read 
it.  If you are only writing an
image loader, you should set this field to '
 <TT>-1</TT>
'.  On the other hand, if you  <I>do</I> intend to write a 
 <TT>Write()</TT>
function for your format, you should edit 
 <TT>xv.h</TT>
, find the 
 <TT>F_*</TT>
 format definitions, and add one for your
format.  See 
 <TT>xvpcx.c</TT>
 for an example of a load-only format, or 
 <TT>xvpbm.c</TT>
 for a load-and-save format.</P>
<P> <TT>int colType;</TT></P>
<P>Used to determine which  <I>Colors</I> setting should be used by default when you 
save a file.  Since  <I>xv</I> will use
this setting no matter  <I>what</I> format you're using, you must fill this field 
in appropriately regardless of
whether or not you plan to have a 
 <TT>Write()</TT>
 function for your format.  This field should be set to
 <TT>F_FULLCOLOR</TT>
 for any type of color image, 
 <TT>F_GREYSCALE</TT>
 for greyscale images, and 
 <TT>F_BWDITHER</TT>
 for
black-and-white 1-bit images.  If in doubt, 
 <TT>F_FULLCOLOR</TT>
 is always a safe choice, though it'd be nice if
your module 'does the right thing'.  (For instance if you read colormapped 
images, you should check to
see if the colormap consists only of shades of grey, and set 
 <TT>F_GREYSCALE</TT>
 if it does.)</P>
<P> <TT>char fullInfo[128];</TT></P>
<P>This string will be shown in the  <I>Format</I> field of the  <I>xv info</I> window.  It 
should be set to something like
this:</P>
<P> <TT>Color PPM, raw format  (12345 bytes)</P>
<P>char shrtInfo[128];</TT></P>
<P>A 'short' version of the info string.  This gets displayed in the  <I>info</I> line 
at the bottom of the  <I>xv controls</I>
and  <I>xv info</I> windows when the image is loaded.  It should look like this:</P>
<P> <TT>512x400 PPM.</P>
<P>char *comment;</TT></P>
<P>If your image file format supports some sort of comment field, and you find 
one in the file, you should
 <TT>malloc()</TT>
 a pointer to a null-terminated string and copy any and all comments into 
this field.  If there
are multiple comments in a file, you should concatenate them together to 
form one long string.  This
string  <I>MUST</I> be null-terminated, as  <I>xv</I> will expect to be able to use 
 <TT>strlen()</TT>
 on it, and possibly other
'string' functions.</P>
<PRE>int numpages;
char pagebname[64];</PRE>
<P>These two fields will only be used if your are writing a 
 <TT>Load()</TT>
 function for a format that may have
multiple images per file.  If your format only ever has a single image per 
file, you don't have to worry
about (or do anything with) these two fields.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if your format  <I>does</I> do multiple images per file,  <I>and</I> the 
current file has more than one
image in it, then what your program should do is  <I>split</I> the multi-image file 
up into a temporary collection
of single-image files, which should probably live in 
 <TT>/tmp</TT>
 or something.  Once you've done so, you should
return the number of files created in 
 <TT>numpages</TT>
, and the 'base' filename of the page files in
 <TT>pagebname</TT>
.  The files created should have a common 'base', with the page number 
appended.  (e.g.,
"/tmp/xvpg12345a.1", "/tmp/xvpg12345a.2", etc., where "/tmp/xvpg12345a." is 
the base filename
(created by the 
 <TT>mktemp()</TT>
 system function))  You should also load the first file and return its 
image in
the normal way.</P>
<P>See the 
 <TT>LoadPS()</TT>
 function in 
 <TT>xvps.c</TT>
 for a complete example of how this is done.  Also, note that if
your format supports multiple image per file, you should also pass in a '
 <TT>quick</TT>
' parameter, which will tell
your function to only load the first 'page' of the file.  This is used by 
the  <I>visual schnauzer</I>, which needs to
load images when it generates icon files.  To speed things up, the  <I>schnauzer</I>
 tells the 
 <TT>Load()</TT>
 function to
only load the first page, as that's all it need to generate the icon file.
</P>
<A NAME="error-handling"><H3>  Error Handling</H3></A>
<P>Non-fatal errors in your 
 <TT>Load()</TT>
 routine should be handled by calling the function
 <TT>SetISTR(ISTR_WARNING, "%s:  %s", bname, err)</TT>
, and returning a zero value.  Where
 <I>bname</I> is the 'simple' name of your file (which can be obtained using 
 <TT>BaseName()</TT>
 function in
 <TT>xvmisc.c</TT>
), and  <I>err</I> should be an appropriate error string.</P>
<P>Non-fatal errors are considered to be errors that only affect the success 
of loading this one image, and not
the continued success of running  <I>xv</I>.  For instance, "can't open file", 
"premature EOF", "garbage in file",
etc. are all non-fatal errors.  On the other hand, not being able to 
allocate memory (unsuccessful returns
from 
 <TT>malloc()</TT>
)  <I>is</I> considered a fatal error, as it means  <I>xv</I> is likely to run out of 
memory in the near
future anyhow.</P>
<P>Fatal errors should be handled by calling 
 <TT>FatalError(error_string)</TT>
.  This function prints the
string to 
 <TT>stderr</TT>
, and exits the program with an error code.</P>
<P>Warnings (such as 'truncated file') that may need to be noted can be 
handled by calling 
 <TT>SetISTR()</TT>
 as
shown above, but continuing to return '1' from the 
 <TT>Load()</TT>
 routine, signifying success.</P>
<P>Also, if your load routine fails for  <I>any reason</I>, it is your responsibility 
to 
 <TT>free()</TT>
 any pointers allocated
(such as the  <I>pic</I> field and the  <I>comment</I> field, and return NULL in these 
fields).  Otherwise, there'll be
memory leaks whenever an image load fails.</P>
<A NAME="hooking-it-up"><H3>  Hooking it up to </B></A>
 <STRONG>xv</STRONG></P>
<P>Once you have written a 
 <TT>Load()</TT>
 routine, you'll want to hook it up to the  <I>xv</I> source.</P>
<P>Edit 
 <TT>xv.h</TT>
 and add a function prototype for any global functions you've written 
(presumably just
 <TT>LoadPBM()</TT>
 in this case).  Follow the style used for the other 
 <TT>Load*()</TT>
 function declarations.</P>
<P>Find the 
 <TT>RFT_*</TT>
 definitions and tack one on the end for your format (e.g., 
 <TT>RFT_PBM</TT>
).  This is a list of
values that '
 <TT>ReadFileType()</TT>
' can return.  We'll be working on that soon enough.</P>
<P>Edit 
 <TT>xv.c</TT>
:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Tell the 
 <TT>ReadFileType()</TT>
 routine about your format.  Add an 'else-if' case that determines if the
file in question is in your format.  Note that it must be possible to uniquely identify 
your format by reading
the first 16 characters (or so) of the file.  If your file format  <I>doesn't</I> 
have some sort of  <I>magic number</I>, you
won't be able to conveniently hook it into  <I>xv</I>, though you can certainly 
come up with some sort of
kludge...</LI>
<LI>Tell the 
 <TT>ReadPicFile()</TT>
 routine about your format.  Add another 
 <TT>case</TT>
 for your format type, and
have it call your 
 <TT>Load()</TT>
 routine with the appropriate arguments.</LI>
<LI>Hook your file up into the  <I>visual schnauzer</I>.  Edit the file 
 <TT>xvbrowse.c</LI>
</OL>
<P> </TT>
The first thing you have to do is create a 'generic' icon for your file 
format.  Copy one of the
existing ones (such as '
 <TT>bits/br_pbm.xbm</TT>
') to get the size and the general 'look' correct.</P>
<P> 
 <TT>#include</TT>
 this icon at the top of the file.</P>
<P> 
Add an appropriately-named 
 <TT>BF_*</TT>
 definition to the end of the list, and increase 
 <TT>BF_MAX</TT>
appropriately.</P>
<P> 
Have the icon pixmap created in the 
 <TT>CreateBrowse()</TT>
 function, by doing something like this:</P>
<PRE>bfIcons[BF_PBM] = MakePix1(br->win, br_pbm_bits,
                           br_pbm_width, br_pbm_height);</PRE>
<P> 
Hook your format into the 
 <TT>scanFile()</TT>
 function.  Find the following code:</P>
<PRE>switch (filetype) {
case RFT_GIF:      bf->ftype = BF_GIF;      break;
case RFT_PM:       bf->ftype = BF_PM;       break;</PRE>
<P>etc...</P>
<P>And add a case for your format.  (To map 
 <TT>RFT_*</TT>
 values into their corresponding 
 <TT>BF_*</TT>
 values.)</P>
<P> 
Hook your format into the 
 <TT>genIcon()</TT>
 function.  Find the following code:</P>
<PRE>sprintf(str, "%dx%d ", pinfo.w, pinfo.h);
switch (filetype) {
  case RFT_GIF:      if (strstr(pinfo.shrtInfo, "GIF89"))
                       strcat(str,"GIF89 file");
                     else
                       strcat(str,"GIF87 file");
  break;
  case RFT_PM:       strcat(str,"PM file");</P>
<P>  break;</PRE>
<P>etc...</P>
<P>And add a case for your format.  This generates an appropriate info string 
that gets put in the icon files
maintained by the  <I>visual schnauzer</I> (and displayed whenever you click on an 
icon in the  <I>schnauzer</I>
window).</P>
<P>That should do it.  Consult the files 
 <TT>xv.h, xv.c, xvbrowse.c,</TT>
 and 
 <TT>xvpbm.c</TT>
 for any further
specifics.</P>
<A NAME="adding-code-writing-new-file-format"><H2>  Adding Code for Writing a New File Format</H2></A>
<P>Note:  Despite the wide variety of displays and file formats  <I>xv</I> deals with, 
internally it only manipulates
 <I>either </I>8-bit colormapped images  <I>or</I> 24-bit RGB images.  Your 
 <TT>Write()</TT>
 routine must be prepared to take
either sort of image, and convert it (if necessary) to the image format that your file format dictates.</P>
<P>If you haven't already done so (if/when you created the

 function):</P>
<P> 
Make a copy of

, calling it something appropriate.  For the rest of this appendix, mentally
replace the string '

<P> 
Edit the 
 <TT>Makefile</TT>
 and/or the 
 <TT>Imakefile</TT>
 so that your new module will be compiled.  In the

 to the end of the

 macro definition.</P>
<P> 
Edit the new module.</P>
<P> 
You'll need to 
 <TT>#include "xv.h"</TT>
, of course.</P>
<P>The module should have one externally callable function that does the work

<PRE>/*******************************************/

<PRE>byte *pic;</PRE>
<P>This points to the image data that will be written.  In the case of a

 <TT>pic</TT>
 will point to a

<P>In the case of a

 <TT>pic</TT>
 will point to a 
 <TT>w*h*3</TT>

<PRE>int ptype, w, h;</PRE>
<P>These variables describe the format of

 <TT>w</TT>
 and 
 <TT>h</TT>
 are the
width and height of the image, in pixels.</P>
<PRE>byte *rmap, *gmap, *bmap;
int   numcols;</PRE>
<P>These pointers point to the colormap associated with the image.  They are 
only relevant when  <I>ptype</I> is
PIC8, meaning that  <I>pic</I> is an 8-bit per pixel colormapped image.  These 
arrays will each be 
 <TT>numcols</TT>
entries long, with a maximum length of 256.  Do not attempt to access 
entries >= 
 <TT>numcols</TT>
, as the
colormaps are  <I>not necessarily</I> 256 entries long.  You are guaranteed that 
pixel values found in 
 <TT>pic</TT>
 will
be within the range [0..numcols-1], so you don't have to check each pixel 
value.  Also, do not attempt to
access these arrays at all if 
 <TT>ptype</TT>
 is PIC24, as these pointers will probably be NULL in that case.</P>
<PRE>int colorstyle;</PRE>
<P>The  <I>Colors</I> choice selected in the  <I>xv save</I> window.  It can be either

<P>Likewise, if the user has selected 
 <B>B/W Dithered</B>
 in the  <I>xv save</I> window, an appropriate black-and-white
image will have been generated before your

 routine is called, so you won't have to worry about
that.  Such an image will be a 
 <TT>PIC8</TT>
 image, with a 2-entry colormap.  It is up to you to decide which of
the two colors should be written as  <I>black</I>, and which should be written as 
 <I>white</I>.  You should do this by
comparing the values of <BR>
 <TT>MONO(rmap[0],gmap[0],bmap[0])</TT>
 <BR>and<BR>
 <TT>MONO(rmap[1],gmap[1],bmap[1])</TT>
.<BR>
Whichever value is smaller is the darker of the two, and should
be written as  <I>black</I>.</P>
<PRE>int raw;</PRE>
<P>This is a value passed in specifically for the 
 <TT>WritePBM()</TT>
 function, as PBM has two closely-related
subformats (raw, and ascii) both of which are written by this one function. 
 Your function won't need this,
nor should it be passed in to your function.</P>
<PRE>char *comment;</PRE>
<P>This will point to a zero-terminated character string which contains the 
comments that should be written
into the image file.  Note that this string can be of  <I>any</I> length, and it 
may contain any number of lines
</P>
<P>(separated by '
 <TT>\\n</TT>
' characters).  If your image format supports comments in the file, you 
should write this
information to the file.  If it doesn't, you should just ignore this 
variable.  Also, this variable may be
 <TT>NULL</TT>
, (signifying 'no comments'), in which case it should not be used.</P>
<P>You may pass more parameters, since you're going to be adding the call to 
this function later on.  For
example, in my PBM code, I pass one more parameter, 'raw' (whether to save 
the file as 'raw' or 'ascii')
to handle two very similar formats.  (Rather than having to write 
 <TT>WritePBMRaw</TT>
() and
 <TT>WritePBMAscii</TT>
() functions.)</P>
<P>Write the function as you deem appropriate.  See 
 <TT>xvpbm.c</TT>
 for an example of a 
 <TT>Write()</TT>
 routine that
writes different formats for 1-bit per pixel images, 8-bit per pixel 
images, and 24-bit per pixel images,
based on 
 <TT>ptype</TT>
 and 
 <TT>colorstyle</TT>
.</P>
<P>Note:  If your file format can only handle 8-bit images, and 
 <TT>ptype</TT>
 is set to 
 <TT>PIC24</TT>
, you will have to call
 <TT>Conv24to8()</TT>
 to convert the 24-bit image into an 8-bit colormapped image that you can 
write to the
file.  See 
 <TT>xvgifwr.c</TT>
 for an example of how this is done.</P>
<P>That done, edit '
 <TT>xv.h</TT>
' and add a function declaration for your new function.  Search for '
 <TT>WritePBM()</TT>
'
in the file for a sample declaration to copy.</P>
<P>Also find the block that begins with:</P>
<PRE>#define F_GIF       0
#define F_JPEG      ( 0 + F_JPGINC)</PRE>
<P>and add a definition for your format.  Note that it'll be easiest to tack it on at the end.</P>
<P>These numbers  <I>must</I> be contiguous, as they are used as indices into the 
 <TT>fmtMB</TT>
 menu in 
 <TT>xvdir.c</TT>
.</P>
<P>Edit '
 <TT>xvdir.c</TT>
'.  This is the module that controls the  <I>xv save</I> window.</P>
<P>Add another format name, in the appropriate position, to the 
 <TT>saveFormats[]</TT>
 string array.</P>
<P>In the function 
 <TT>DoSave()</TT>
, find the following block:</P>
<PRE>switch (fmt) {
  case F_GIF:
    rv = WriteGIF(fp, thepic, ptype, w, h, rp, gp, bp, nc, col,
picComments);
  break;
  case F_PM:
    rv = WritePM (fp, thepic, ptype, w, h, rp, gp, bp, nc, col,
picComments);
  break;</PRE>
<P>and add a case for your function.</P>
<P>Finally, if your format has a common 3 or 4 letter filename suffix (like, 
".gif", ".jpg", etc.), you should
modify the 
 <TT>changeSuffix()</TT>
 routine in 
 <TT>xvdir.c</TT>
 so that it recognizes your suffix, and puts your
suffix on when someone selects your format.</P>
<P>And It's just that easy!</P>
<A NAME="writing-complex-formats"><H3>  Writing Complex Formats</H3></A>
<P>Okay, maybe it's not  <I>that</I> easy...</P>
<P>If your format requires some additional information to specify how the file 
should be saved (such as the
'quality' setting in JPEG, or position/size parameters in PostScript), then 
your task is somewhat more
difficult.  You'll have to create some sort of pop-up dialog box to get the 
additional information that you
want.  You'll also have to change the way your 
 <TT>Write()</TT>
 function gets called (as it will now get called
from your pop-up dialog box).  (Though, if you only feel like doing a quick 
hack, you can probably just
</P>
<P>use the 
 <TT>GetStrPopUp()</TT>
 function to get a one-line character string from the user, and avoid the
complication of writing your own dialog box.)</P>
<P>This is not recommended for anyone who doesn't understand Xlib programming. 
 Frankly, it's not
recommended for those who  <I>do</I>
, either, but they at least stand some chance of success.</P>
<P>The more adventurous types who wish to pursue this should take a look at 
the 
 <TT>xvjpeg.c</TT>
 code, which
implements an extremely simple pop-up dialog.  A considerably more 
complicated dialog box is
implemented in 
 <TT>xvps.c</TT>
.  In addition to writing a module like these for your format, you'll also 
have to
add the appropriate hooks to the 
 <TT>DoSave()</TT>
 function (in 
 <TT>xvdir.c</TT>
) and the 
 <TT>HandleEvent()</TT>
 function
(in 
 <TT>xvevent.c</TT>
).  '
 <TT>grep PS *.c</TT>
' will be helpful in finding places where the 
 <TT>xvps.c</TT>
 module is
called.
