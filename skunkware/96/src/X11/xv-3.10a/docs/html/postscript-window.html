<IMG SRC="fig-196.gif" WIDTH=445 HEIGHT=380>
<P>The  <I>xv postscript</I> window lets you describe how your image should look when 
printed.  You can set the
paper size and the image size, position the image on the paper, and print 
in 'portrait' or 'landscape'
mode.</P>
<P>The majority of the  <I>xv postscript</I> window is taken up by a window that shows 
a white rectangle (the page)
with a black rectangle (the image) positioned on it.  You can position the 
image rectangle anywhere on
the page.  The only constraint is that the center of the image (where the 
two diagonal lines meet) must
remain on the page.  Only the portion of the image that is on the page will actually be printed.</P>
<P>The image can be (roughly) positioned on the page by clicking in the image 
rectangle and dragging it
around.  As you move the image, the "Top" and "Left" position displays will 
show the size of the top and
left margins (the distance between the top-left corner of the page and the top-left corner of the image).</P>
<P>You'll note that you have limited placement resolution with the mouse.  If 
you want to fine-position the
image, you can use the arrow keys to move the image around.  The arrow keys 
will move the image in
.001" increments.  You can hold them down, and they will auto-repeat.  You 
can also hold a 
 <B>&lt;Shift></B>
 key
down while using the arrow keys.  This will move the image in .010" increments.</P>
<P>You can change the size of the printed image by adjusting the
 <I>Width</I> or  <I>Height</I> dials.  Normally, the dials are locked together, to
keep the aspect ratio of the image constant.  You can unlock the
dials by turning the off the checkbox located below the dials.  As
you change the dials, the size of the image (when printed) is
displayed below, in inches and in millimeters.  The current
resolution of the image is also displayed below.  The "Resolution"
numbers tell you how many image pixels will be printed per inch.

</P>
<IMG SRC="fig-197.gif" WIDTH=177 HEIGHT=125>
<P>One note on the 'Resolution' setting:  I get a fair number of complaints 
about the default of '100% = 72
dpi'.  Many folks wonder why they can't set the resolution to 300 dpi, 
given that most PostScript printers
are 300 dpi.  The answer, of course, is that they can.  While you are 
constrained to integral percentage
scaling factors, all the  <I>good</I> resolutions (72, 75, 100, 150, 300, and 600 
dpi) are attainable with
appropriate settings of the scaling factors (100, 96, 72, 48, 24, and 12%, respectively).</P>
<P>Now, one other thing to note is that,  <I>unless</I> you are printing a 
black-and-white (not greyscale) image, you
almost certainly do  <I>not</I>
 want to print at 300 dpi (or whatever your printer's resolution is).  At 
this time, all
but the most enormous and expensive PostScript printers (> $20K) are 
fundamentally  <I>bitonal</I>.  That is,
they can either put a dot at a certain position on a page, or  <I>not</I> put a dot 
there.  They have no ability (or
nearly none) to adjust the size or darkness of the dot.  As such, they 
cannot put an arbitrary 8-bit shade of
gray (or 24-bit RGB color) at each 300 (or 600) dpi pixel position.  They 
approximate grays (and colors)
by dithering over a larger area.  For example, if you print at 75 dpi onto 
a 300 dpi printer, each arbitrarily
colored pixel in your source image will be represented by a 4x4 grid of 
bitonal dots on the page.  This is
why you should print non-bitonal images at low resolutions, such as 72 dpi. 
 If you try to print them at
higher resolutions, you will lose shades of gray (or different colors).</P>
<P>Located below the 'page' rectangle are a set of radio buttons that let you 
specify the current paper size
(8.5"x11", 8.5"x14", 11"x17", A3, A4, B5, 4"x5", and 35mm), and orientation (Portrait and Landscape).

<DD>This  button will center the image on the page.

</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-199.gif" WIDTH=56 HEIGHT=23></DT>
<DD>This button will align the bottom-left of the image with the bottom-left of 
the
page.  (Which is the origin in the standard PostScript coordinate system.)  
This
may be useful if you are generating Encapsulated PostScript files for use in
some desktop-publishing package.

</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-200.gif" WIDTH=56 HEIGHT=23></DT>
<DD>This button will make the image as large as possible (maintaining half-inch
margins on all sides) without changing the aspect ratio.

</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-201.gif" WIDTH=172 HEIGHT=42></DT>
<DD>There are a pair of small buttons located next to the "Left" and "Top" 
displays.  Clicking the "Left" one
will cycle between displaying the "Left" margin, the "Right" margin, and 
the "Center X" position (the
distance from the left edge of the paper to the center of the image).
<P>Clicking the "Top" display's button will cycle between displaying the size of the "Top" margin, 
the size of
the "Bottom" margin, and the "Center Y" position (the distance from the top 
edge of the paper to the
center of the image).
</P>
</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-202.gif" WIDTH=70 HEIGHT=17></DT>
<DD>This checkbox lets you specify whether or not to include a b/w preview of 
the
image in the PostScript file.  Certain desktop publishing programs may make
use of such a preview.

</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-203.gif" WIDTH=78 HEIGHT=17></DT>
<DD>Specifies whether or not to generate compressed 8-bit per pixel PostScript.
This is particularly handy if you're generating color PostScript, and you 
are currently in  <B>8-bit Mode</B>, as color PostScript files are normally
three times larger than their greyscale counterparts.  Compression can shrink
these color
PostScript files by a factor of 4:1.  It has a lesser effect on greyscale 
images.  It
should be noted, however, that compressed PostScript files may take 2-3 
times
longer to print than uncompressed PostScript files.  However, if you are
connected to your laser printer via a slow 9600 baud serial line, the 
decreased
transmission time due to compression may make up for the increased execution
time. Also note that the '
 <B>compress</B>
' checkbox is not available when you are in
 <B>24-bit Mode</B>
</DD>

<P>Click the 
 <B>Ok</B>
 button when you're done.  If everything is successful, the <I>xv postscript</I> 
and the  <I>xv save</I>
window will both close.  If  <I>xv</I> was unable to write the PostScript file, the 
 <I>xv postscript</I> window will close,
but the  <I>xv save</I>
 window will remain open, to give you a chance to enter a different filename.</P>
