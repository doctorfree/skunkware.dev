<BODY><H1>The Load Window</H1>
<IMG SRC="fig-166.gif" WIDTH=364 HEIGHT=430>
<P>The  <I>xv load</I> window lets you load and view images interactively, without 
specifying them on the
command line when you start  <I>xv</I>
.  While it has been made somewhat obsolete by the  <I>Visual Schnauzer</I>, the
 <I>xv load</I> window is considerably quicker.</P>
<P>The load window shows the contents of the current directory in a scrolling 
window.  The files will be
sorted alphabetically, with a small icon for each indicating the type of 
file (directory, executable, or
normal file).</P>
<P>This list window operates in the same way that the one in the  <I>xv controls</I> 
window works.  (See "<A HREF="control-window.html#operating-list-window">Operating a List Window"</A>
 for details.)  In short, you can operate 
the scroll bar, drag the highlight
bar around the window, and use the 
 <B>&lt;Up></B>
, 
 <B>&lt;Down></B>
, 
 <B>&lt;Home></B>
, 
 <B>&lt;End></B>
, 
 <B>&lt;PageUp></B>
, and 
 <B>&lt;PageDown></B>
keys on your keyboard.</P>
<P>Whenever you click on a name in the list (or otherwise change the position of 
the highlight bar), the name
of the highlighted file is copied to the "Load file" text entry region, 
located below the list window.
Pressing the 
 <B>Ok</B>
 button (or hitting 
 <B>&lt;Return></B>
) will make  <I>xv</I> attempt to load the specified file.  If the load
attempt is successful, the load window will disappear, and the new image will be displayed.  Otherwise, an
error message will be displayed, and the load window will remain visible.
</P>
<TABLE>
<TD><IMG SRC="fig-167.gif" WIDTH=64 HEIGHT=17></TD>
<TD>
<P>The  <B>Browse</B> checkbox overrides this behavior, and keeps the load window
visible until explicitly closed (via the  <B>Cancel</B> button).  This is handy
if you're using  <I>xv</I> to 'wander around a directory tree', and plan to be
using the <B>Load</B> command quite often.  (Though a better way would probably
involve using the <B>Visual Schnauzer</B>.)</P>
</TD>
</TABLE>
<P>If the image is successfully loaded, its name will be added to the 
 <I>xv controls</I> window list.  This will let you
quickly reload it later without have to go through the  <I>xv load</I> window again.</P>
<P>You can also load a file by double-clicking on its name in the file list.</P>
<P>If the specified filename begins with a '!' or '|' character, the filename 
will be interpreted as a shell
command to run.  The leading '!' or '|' is dropped, and the rest of the 
line is fed to the default system
shell.  The command is expected to generate an image in one of the  <I>xv</I>
-recognized formats as its standard
output.  If the command returns non-zero,  <I>xv</I> assumes it failed, and doesn't 
try to read the output
produced.  You can pipe multiple commands together.  For example loading "
 <TT>! xwd | xwdtopnm</TT>
"
would run  <I>xwd</I> to generate a window dump, pipe that to  <I>xwdtopnm</I>
 to convert it to a PPM file, and that file
would be piped to  <I>xv</I>.</P>
<P>If the specified file is a directory,  <I>xv</I>
 will figure that out and (instead of loading it) will  <I>cd</I> to that directory,
and display its contents in the list window.</P>
<P>Above the list window is a pop-up menu button.  It normally displays the name 
of the current directory.  If
you click this button, and hold the mouse down, the complete path will be 
shown, one directory per line.
You can go 'up' the directory tree any number of levels, all the way up to 
the root directory, by simply
selecting a directory name in this list.</P>
<P>For those who prefer the direct approach, you can simply type file or 
directory names in the "Load file"
text entry region.  If you type a directory name and hit 
 <B>&lt;Return></B>
,  <I>xv</I> will  <I>cd</I> to that directory and display
its contents in the list window.  If you type a file name and hit 
 <B>&lt;Return></B>
,  <I>xv</I> will attempt to load the file.
You can enter relative paths (relative to the currently displayed 
directory), absolute paths, and even paths
that begin with a '~'.</P>
<P>The "Load file" text entry region supports a number of  <I>emacs</I>
-like editing keys:
<DL>
<DT>
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> f</B>
</DT><DD>
moves the cursor forward one character
</DD>
<DT> <B>&lt;Ctrl> b</B></DT>
<DD>moves the cursor backward one character</DD>
<DT> <B>&lt;Ctrl> a</B></DT>
<DD>moves the cursor to the beginning of the line</DD>
<DT> <B>&lt;Ctrl> e</B></DT>
<DD>moves the cursor to the end of the line</DD>
<DT> <B>&lt;Ctrl> d</B></DT>
<DD>deletes the character to the right of the cursor</DD>
<DT> <B>&lt;Ctrl> u</B></DT>
<DD>clears the entire line</DD>
<DT> <B>&lt;Ctrl> k</B></DT>
<DD>clears from the cursor position to the end of the line.</DD>
<DT> <B>&lt;Tab></B></DT>
<DD>Filename completion.  Note:  it can only complete 'simple' filenames (no '/' chars)</P></DD>
</DL>
<P>If the filename is so long that it cannot be completely displayed in the 
text entry region, a thick line will
appear on the left or right side (or both sides) of the region to show that "there's more over this way".
</P>

<DD>Pressing the 
 <B>Rescan</B>
 button will rescan the current directory.  While the
contents of the current directory are read each time the load window is 
opened,
it is perfectly possible (given a multitasking operating system) that some 
other
program may add, delete, or rename files in the current directory.   <I>xv</I> 
would not
know if this happened.  The 
 <B>Rescan</B>
 button gives you an easy way of 'kicking'
 <I>xv</I> into looking again.

</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-169.gif" WIDTH=81 HEIGHT=25></DT>
<DD>The 
 <B>Load All</B>
 button simply copies the names of all 'plain files' found in the
current directory into the  <I>xv controls</I> filename list, where you have the 
 <B>Next</B>
and 
 <B>Prev</B>
 buttons to help you look at a list of files.
