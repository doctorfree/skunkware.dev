<H1>The Diversity Algorithm</H1></P>
<P>The problem:  You want to display an image that has  <I>n</I> colors in it.  You 
can only get  <I>m</I> colors, where
 <I>m</I>&lt; <I>n</I>.  What colors do you use?</P>
<P>As explained in
 <A HREF="color-allocation.html">"Color Allocation in <I>xv</I>"</A>
, colors on a non- <I>TrueColor</I> X display are a 
scarce resource.  You can't
guarantee that you'll get as many colors as you might like.  You can't even 
know ahead of time how many
colors you will succeed in getting.  As such, the first step of all of the 
color allocation algorithms
(described in
 <A HREF="color-allocation.html">"Color Allocation in <I>xv</I>"</A>
) is to sort the colors in order of decreasing 
'importance'.  The colors are then
allocated in this order, so that if the color allocation fails after  <I>m</I> 
colors, then at least we allocated the  <I>m</I>
most 'important' colors.</P>
<P>This sorting algorithm is called the  <I>Diversity Algorithm</I>, and is described 
in detail here.  While the
algorithms described in
 <A HREF="color-allocation.html">"Color Allocation in <I>xv</I>"</A>
 are probably only of use to other X 
programmers (or programmers
using other windowing systems with shared colormap resources), the Diversity Algorithm should be 
of use
to anyone who has to display an image using fewer colors than they'd like 
to have.  As far as I know, the
Diversity Algorithm is a completely original algorithm designed for this program.</P>
<A NAME="picking-most-important-colors"><H2>  Picking the Most 'Important' Colors</H2></A>
<P>There are many different criteria that one could use to define which colors in an image are 'important'.</P>
<P>The most naive approach would be to simply ignore the question, and just 
use the first  <I>m</I> colors from the
colormap.  This is clearly unacceptable.  The entries in a colormap are 
generally not sorted in any order
whatsoever.  Even when the colors  <I>are</I>
 sorted in some order, it's not likely that it will be a useful order.</P>
<P>For example, in a normal greyscale picture, there is an implied colormap 
consisting of a continuous
collection of greys, with black at the beginning, and white at the end.  If 
a program were to only use the
first few colors from this colormap, it would  have several shades of  <I>black</I>
, but no  <I>whites</I>, or even  <I>middle
greys</I>.</P>
<P>A method of determining a color's importance to the overall picture quality is needed.</P>
<P>A color's 'importance' can be determined intuitively by asking the question 
"If we can only use one of
these two colors, which one would make the picture look better?".  The goal 
is to have the picture be
recognizable with very few colors.  Additional colors should smooth out 
color gradation, but should not
add significant detail, nor change the color balance of the overall picture.</P>
<P>Picking colors in this order is not a trivial task, and is open to some 
degree of subjectivity.  One method
might involve calculating a histogram of the data to find out which colors 
are used the most often (i.e.,
which colors have the greatest number of pixels associated with them), and 
using those colors first.  This
is certainly a valid approach, but it places too much emphasis on large, 
uniformly colored regions, such as
backgrounds.  This is not generally where the 'interesting' portion of the picture is found.</P>
<P>For example, assume a picture that consists of a blue background, with a 
relatively small  <I>red</I> square on it.
Furthermore, suppose that the background isn't just one solid shade of 
blue, but is actually made up of
three shades of blue ( <I>light blue</I>,  <I>dark blue</I>, and  <I>medium blue</I>, to give them 
names).  Finally, assume that a
histogram has been computed, and  <I>light blue</I> has been found to be the most 
prevalent color, followed by
 <I>medium blue</I>,  <I>dark blue</I>, and  <I>red</I>, in that order.</P>
<P>Now, attempt to display this picture using only two colors.  Which two 
should be used?  If the selection
criteria is simply 'in order of decreasing usage',  <I>light blue</I> and 
 <I>medium blue</I> would be picked.  However, if
this is done the  <I>red</I> square will disappear completely (as  <I>red</I> will wind up 
being 'approximated' by one of
the two blues).
Clearly the solution is to use  <I>red</I> and one of the blues.  Which blue, 
though?  It could be argued that since
there are three blues and only one of them can be used,  <I>middle blue</I> should 
be selected, since it is the
'average' blue.  This is where it gets somewhat subjective.  The Diversity 
Algorithm would pick  <I>light
blue</I>, since it is used more than the others.  When possible, the algorithm 
will try to maximize the number
of pixels that are 'correct' (i.e. exactly what was asked for), rather than 
trying to minimize the total error
of the picture.  This way, additional colors smooth out gradations, rather 
than changing the overall color
balance of the picture.</P>
<P>Suppose that a small  <I>yellow</I> circle is added to the picture described above. 
 If the problem is still 'display
this picture using only two colors', then it cannot be resolved in any 
satisfactory method.  There are no
two colors that will adequately display  <I>red</I>,  <I>yellow</I>, and  <I>blue</I> 
simultaneously .  No matter what colors are
used, one of the three major colors will be lost.  As this is now a no-win 
scenario, it is no longer very
interesting.  It doesn't matter what colors are picked, since it will look 
bad regardless.  However, if the
problem is changed, and  <I>three</I> colors can now be selected, it is intuitively 
obvious that  <I>yellow</I>,  <I>red</I>, and
one of the blues should be selected.</P>
<P>So, the question is, "what is being maximized when colors are selected in 
this manner?"  Certainly, since
the blue regions are so much larger than the  <I>red</I> and  <I>yellow</I> regions, any 
rule based on the number of
pixels satisfied by the color choice is irrelevant.  What  <I>is</I> being 
maximized is the  <I>diversity</I> of the colors.
By picking colors that are as unlike each other as possible, we wind up 
covering the 'inhabited' portion of
the RGB color space as quickly as possible.</P>
<P>As a general rule, this tends to bring out the major details (such as 
objects) in the picture first, since the
details are likely to involve contrasting colors.  As more colors are 
picked, gaps in the RGB space are
filled in.  This smoothes out the color gradations, and brings out lesser detail (such as texture).</P>
<A NAME="original-diversity-algorithm"><H2>  The Original Diversity Algorithm</H2></A>
<P>The algorithm operates as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Run a histogram on the entire picture to determine 'pixel counts' for 
each desired color in the
colormap.  Important point:  throw away any colors that have a 'pixel 
count' of 0.  These colors are never
actually used in the image, and it's important that we not waste valuable 
colorcells allocating unused
colors.</LI>
<LI>Pick the color with the highest pixel count.  This is the 'overall' color of the picture.</LI>
<LI>Run through the list of un-picked colors, and find the one with the 
greatest 'distance' from the first
color.  This is the color that is most diverse from the 'overall' color.  
Distance is defined by the traditional
'Euclidean' formula:</P>
<P> <I>d</I>  =  [ (r1 - r2)^2 + (g1 - g2)^2 + (b1 - b2)^2 ]^1/2</P>
<P>where r1,g1,b1 are the RGB components of one color, and r2,g2,b2 are the 
RGB components of another
color.   <I>d</I> is the computed distance between the two colors.</P></LI>
<LI>For each color remaining in the 'unpicked' list, compute the distance 
from it to each of the colors in
the 'picked' list.  Find the color in the unpicked list that is furthest from all of the 
colors in the picked list.
Pick this color.  Repeat until all colors have been picked.</LI>
</OL>
<A NAME="modified-diversity-algorithm"><H2>  The Modified Diversity Algorithm</H2></A>
<P>Tom Lane of the Independent JPEG Group came up with a couple of 
improvements to the Diversity
Algorithm, resulting in the Modified Diversity Algorithm, which is what  <I>xv</I> 
currently uses.  He rightly
pointed out that, on displays with an intermediate number of colors (~64), 
too much emphasis was being
placed on getting 'different' colors, and not enough emphasis was placed on getting the 'correct' colors.
His idea was to modify the sorting criteria slightly, to better balance the 
allocation between diverse colors
and 'popular' colors (colors with high 'pixel counts').  His solution to 
the problem was to alternate
between picking colors based on diversity and based on popularity.</P>
<P>In the Modified Diversity Algorithm, as implemented in  <I>xv</I>, the first color 
picked is the most-popular
color.  The second color picked is the color furthest away from the first 
color.  The third through tenth
colors picked are all picked using the normal Diversity Algorithm.  The eleventh color picked 
is picked on
popularity, (the un-picked color with the highest 'pixel count' is chosen). 
 The twelfth color is once again
picked on diversity.  The thirteenth color is chosen on popularity, and so 
on, alternating, until all the
colors have been picked.</P>
<P>It should be pointed out that there's a fair amount of subjectivity here, 
and certainly different fine-tunings
of the color picking order will make some pictures look better, and other 
pictures look worse.  Tom
originally had the algorithm pick colors alternately based on diversity and 
popularity right from the first
color.  (The first color picked on popularity, the second on diversity, the 
third on popularity, etc.)  I felt
that this broke the algorithm for displays with very few colors (&lt;16), 
and proposed the strategy described
above.  (First color picked on popularity, the next ten colors picked on 
diversity, remaining colors
alternately picked on popularity and diversity.)</P>
<P>Tom's other major modification to the Diversity Algorithm was to rewrite it 
so that 'diverse' colors are
picked in O( <I>n</I>
2
) time, instead of O( <I>n</I>
3
) time.</P>
