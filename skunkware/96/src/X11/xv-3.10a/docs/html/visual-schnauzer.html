<A NAME="what-s-visual-schnauzer"><H2>  What's a Visual Schnauzer?</H2></A>
<P>Hint:  it's not a smallish seeing-eye dog of Germanic descent.</P>
<P>Probably the most exciting new feature in Version 3.00 was the  <I>Visual 
Schnauzer</I>, and while it hasn't
changed dramatically in Version 3.10, it's still plenty exciting.  The 
 <I>Visual Schnauzer </I>gives you a visual
interface to the UNIX file system.  It lets you view tiny 'thumbnail' 
representations of your image files,
directories, and other files.  It lets you create directories, rename 
files, move and copy files to different
directories, delete files, view image files, view text files, and just generally nose around.</P>
<P>In short, it's cool, and it should be of some use for those of us who have 
large numbers of GIF and JPEG
files with non-descriptive MS-DOS- <I>style</I> '8+3' filenames.</P>
<P>Note:  Unlike most  <I>xv</I> windows, schnauzer windows are resizable.  You can 
decide how many (or few)
icons you'd like displayed by changing the size of the schnauzer window.  
It also should be pointed out
that there are more command buttons available than are shown at the default 
schnauzer size.  If you make
the window larger, you will be given additional command buttons.   <I>All</I>
 the commands are always available
from the 
 <B>Misc. Commands</B>
 menu.</P>
<A NAME="operating-schnauzer"><H2>  Operating the Schnauzer</H2></A>
<P>Click on the 
 <B>Visual Schnauzer</B>
 button in the  <I>xv controls</I> window, or type a 
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> v</B>
 inside any active  <I>xv</I>
window.  This will open a schnauzer window.  The window will display the 
contents of the directory that
you were in when you started  <I>xv</I>.  (Though this behavior, like so many 
things, can be overridden.  See the
description of the '
 <TT>-dir</TT>
' command-line option in "<A HREF="modifying-behavior.html#miscellaneous-options">Miscellaneous Options"</A>
.)</P>
<P>The first time you open an image directory with the schnauzer, you'll find 
that your image files are  <I>not</I>
displayed as spiffy little thumbnail icons, but instead are shown as 
generic icons showing the file format
used.  This is because the icons need to be generated from the image files. 
 Displaying a thumbnail icon
would normally require loading the entire image, compressing it down to a 
small 80x60- <I>ish</I> image, and
dithering it with some set of colors.  This is a very time-consuming 
operation.  To avoid doing this every
single time you open a schnauzer window,  <I>xv</I> lets you do this operation 
once, and it maintains the results
in a hidden subdirectory ('
 <TT>.xvpics</TT>
') for each directory.  This subdirectory contains one small (2k) file
for each file in the parent directory.  The icons are in an 8-bit per pixel 
format, pre-dithered with a 332
RGB colormap.</P>
<P>So, assuming that there are some image files in the current directory, the 
first thing you should do is
generate some icons.  (If there aren't any image files in the current 
directory, exit  <I>xv</I> and start it again
from a directory that  <I>does</I>
 have image files.  We'll discuss navigating via the schnauzer later.)</P>
<A NAME="generating-icons"><H3>  Generating Image Icons</H3></A>
<P>To generate icons for all the images in the current directory, issue the 
 <B>select All files</B>
 command from the
 <B>Misc. Commands</B>
 menu.  All the icons in the current directory should 'light up' in some 
way to signify
that they are selected, with the possible exception of the 
 <TT>&lt;parent></TT>
 directory.</P>
<P>Next, issue the 
 <B>Generate icons</B>
 command from the 
 <B>Misc. Commands</B>
 menu.   <I>xv</I> will begin the process of
generating icon files for the selected files.  This process can be quite 
time-consuming, particularly if you
have a large number of files in the directory, or the image files are in 
the JPEG format.  During this time,
 <I>xv</I> is effectively 'out-to-lunch', as it will not be paying attention to any 
X events.  There isn't any way to
stop it either, though if you  <I>kill</I> the  <I>xv</I> process from another window, you 
will succeed in stopping the icon
generation.  You will  <I>not</I> lose any computed icons by doing this, as icon 
files are written out as they are
computed, so it's perfectly safe to stop the generation via this method.</P>
<P>Also, you'll note that  <I>xv</I> displays a bar-graph 'progress meter' at the top 
of the schnauzer window while
it's doing this, so you can gauge roughly how long it will take.  Icons 
will be displayed as they are
generated, in an attempt to make the process as entertaining as possible.</P>
<A NAME="changing-directories"><H3>  Changing Directories</H3></A>
<P>The name of the current directory is displayed in a button at the 
top-center of the schnauzer window.  You
can change to any higher-level directory in the current path by pulling 
down this menu button.  The
names of the parent directories will be shown in the pull down menu.</P>
<P>You can also go up one level by double-clicking on the 
 <TT>&lt;parent></TT>
 directory icon.</P>
<P>You can go down to any subdirectory by double-clicking on the appropriate subdirectory icon.</P>
<P>The 
 <B>Change Directory</B>
 command gives you a more direct route:  you just type the pathname of the
directory you'd like to go to.</P>
<A NAME="scrolling-schnauzer"><H3>  Scrolling the Schnauzer</H3></A>
<P>You can scroll the schnauzer by operating the vertical scroll bar, which 
operates exactly as described in
"<A HREF="control-window.html#operating-list-window">Operating a List Window"</A>
.</P>
<P>You can also scroll the window a page at a time by using the 
 <B>&lt;PageUp></B>
 and 
 <B>&lt;PageDown></B>
 keys on your
keyboard (which may be labeled 
 <B>&lt;Prev></B>
 and 
 <B>&lt;Next> </B>
 on some keyboards).  The 
 <B>&lt;Home></B>
 and 
 <B>&lt;End></B>
keys will take you to the beginning and end of the list, respectively.  (If 
your keyboard doesn't have Home
and End keys, 
 <B>&lt;Shift></B>
 
 <B>&lt;PageUp> </B>
and 
 <B>&lt;Shift></B>
 
 <B>&lt;PageDown></B>
 may also work.)  You can scroll the list aline at a time by using the up
 and down arrow keys.  Note, however, that 
the arrow keys move the
indicator that shows the currently selected file.  Likewise, the left and 
right arrow keys move the selection
indicator left and right, wrapping at the edges of the window.</P>
<P>Also, if you type a normal, alphabetic character into the schnauzer window, 
it will attempt to scroll the
window so that the first file beginning with that character will be 
visible.  Note that this behavior keeps
you from typing normal  <I>xv</I>
 keyboard equivalents into this window, so don't even try it.</P>
<A NAME="selecting-files"><H3>  Selecting Files</H3></A>
<P>Double-click on an image file's icon.  The image should be loaded, and the 
full path name of the image
should be added to the bottom of the  <I>xv controls</I> window's name list.  You 
can also double-click on text
files to view them in a TextView window.  (See "<A HREF="textview-window.html">The TextView 
Window"</A>
 for more
information.)</P>
<P>It is possible to select more than one file at a time.  The easiest way to 
do so is to hold down the 
 <B>&lt;Shift></B>
key and click on icons.  When the 
 <B>&lt;Shift></B>
 key is held down, any icons clicked on are simply toggled
between being selected, and being  <I>not</I> selected.  All other files remain as 
they were.  If you type 
 <B>&lt;Shift>
&lt;Space></B>
,  <I>xv</I> will keep all currently 'lit' files lit, and light (and load) the file 
 <I>after </I>the last lit file it finds.
This can be useful for building up a big list of files to delete by 
 <B>&lt;Shift> &lt;Space></B>
-ing your way through
the list, and manually unselecting any files you want to keep.</P>
<P>You can also select files by drawing a rectangle around icons that you want 
selected.  To do so, simply
click in the space in between the icons, and drag.  A rectangle will be 
drawn, and all icons that are inside
(or partially inside) the rectangle will be selected.  Note that if you drag the rectangle 
off the top or bottom
of the window, the window will automatically scroll.  Also, if you hold 
down the 
 <B>&lt;Shift></B>
 key while you
draw a rectangle, any previously selected icons will continue to remain lit.</P>
<P>Finally, you can also select files by using the 
 <B>select All files</B>
 command from the menu (or by typing a
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> a</B>
) to select all the icons in the current directory.  If you want  <I>most</I> of 
the files selected, it might be
easiest to select all the files, hold down the 
 <B>&lt;Shift></B>
 key, and selectively turn off the ones you don't want
selected.</P>
<P>If you double-click on a selected file while there are multiple files 
selected, the clicked-on file will be
displayed, and  <I>all</I> selected filenames will be copied into the  <I>xv controls</I>
 window's list.</P>
<A NAME="file-management"><H3>  File Management</H3></A>
<P>Once you have some files selected, you can move them to other directories 
by clicking on a lit icon and
dragging it into one of the subdirectories.  When you press the mouse 
button, the cursor will change to a
'files' cursor to indicate that you are potentially moving files around.  
If you move the cursor near the top
or bottom edge of the window, the window will scroll up or down 
accordingly.  Necessary, as the
subdirectory folders are always shown at the top of the window.  When you 
move the cursor on top of a
folder (either the 
 <TT>&lt;parent></TT>
 directory, or one of the subdirectories), the folder will light up to
acknowledge your selection.  If you release the mouse button while a folder 
is lit, all currently selected
files (and folders) will be moved into the lit folder.</P>
<P>Note that, using only one schnauzer window, it's only possible to move 
files up or down one directory
level.  If you want to move files to completely unrelated directories, you 
can easily accomplish this by
opening a second schnauzer window (via the 
 <B>open new Window</B>
 command in the menu, or 
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> w</B>
).
Get the second schnauzer window aimed at the desired destination directory, 
and simply drag the files
from the first window into the second window.</P>
<P>Also, when you drag files around,  <I>xv</I> normally 'moves' the files from one 
directory to another.  If you'd
like, you can copy files instead of moving them.  Just press (and hold 
down) the 
 <B>&lt;Ctrl></B>
 key while dragging the files.  The 'files' cursor will change to display 'CPY' as 
well, to signify that you are copying
files instead of moving them.</P>
<P>The remaining file-management commands (renaming files, deleting files, and 
creating subdirectories)
are discussed below.</P>
<A NAME="commands"><H2>  The Commands</H2></A>
<P>There are more commands available in the schnauzer than are
normally displayed in the buttons at the bottom of the window.  The
additional buttons will be displayed if you make the window larger.

</TABLE>
<P>Note that the keyboard equivalent for all commands that have one is
listed in the menu, next to the command.  ('^' means 
 <B>&lt;Ctrl></B>
)</P>
<P>Also note that the bottom two commands, 
 <B>Show hidden files</B>
, and
 <B>Select files</B>
, do not appear as buttons, ever.  They're only accessible
via the 
 <B>Misc. Commands</B>
 menu.

<DL>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-148.gif" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=16></DT>
<DD>Pops open a dialog box that prompts you for a directory name to  <I>cd</I> to.
This can be handy if the directory you want to go to is far away in the
directory tree.<BR>
Keyboard Equivalent:  
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> c
</B>
</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-149.gif" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=16></DT>
<DD>This command can only be issued when one or more files (or
directories) are selected.  It will pop up a confirmation box to make
sure you didn't accidentally issue the command.  At the confirmation
box, you can type 
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> d</B>
 a second time to say 
 <B>Ok</B>
, or press 
 <B>&lt;Esc></B>
 to
 <B>Cancel</B>
 the deletion.  (Of course, you can just click on the appropriate
button, as well.)  Also, note that if you delete a subdirectory, all files
and directories in that subdirectory will be recursively deleted.
Finally, note that you can't delete the 
 <TT>&lt;parent></TT>
 directory...  for your
own protection.<BR>
Keyboard Equivalent: 
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> d
</B>
</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-150.gif" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=16></DT>
<DD>When you issue this command you'll be prompted for a plain filename
for the new directory.  You can only create subdirectories in the
current directory.<BR>
Keyboard Equivalent: 
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> n</B>


</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-152.gif" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=16></DT>
<DD>This command can only be used when a single file (or subdirectory) is
selected.  You'll be prompted for the new name.  Also, note that you
can't rename the 
 <TT>&lt;parent></TT>
 directory, again, for your own good.<BR>
Keyboard Equivalent: 
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> r
</B>
</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-153.gif" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=16></DT>
<DD>Rescans the current directory.  Since other programs may be creating
or deleting files in the current directory, the contents shown in the
schnauzer may not always be up-to-date.  Use the 
 <B>ReScan</B>
 command to
re-read the current directory.<BR>
Keyboard Equivalent: 
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> s
</B>
</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-154.gif" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=16></DT>
<DD>Like the 
 <B>ReScan</B>
 command, but more serious about it.  In addition to
re-reading the current directory contents, it will also look for files that
don't have icons created (or files that have later modification times
than their associated icon files) and generate icons for them.  After
that, it will look for icon files that no longer have associated image
files (which can happen if you delete the image files without using the
schnauzer), and deletes them.  Note that this command is  <I>not</I> limited
to the selected files, unlike the 
 <B>Generate icon(s)</B>
 command listed
below.<BR>
Keyboard Equivalent: 
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> u
</B>
</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-155.gif" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=16></DT>
<DD>Opens a new schnauzer window, up to a maximum of 4.  The new
schnauzer opened will display the same directory that the opening-
schnauzer was displaying.<BR>
Keyboard Equivalent: 
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> w
</B>
</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-156.gif" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=16></DT>
<DD>Unconditionally generates icons for all the currently selected files.  As
such, you can only issue this command when one or more files are
selected.<BR>
Keyboard Equivalent: 
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> g
</B>
</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-157.gif" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=16></DT>
<DD>Selects all files in the current directory.<BR>
Keyboard Equivalent: 
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> a
</B>
</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-158.gif" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=16></DT>
<DD>Displays the currently-selected file in a TextView window.  This
command can only be used when there is exactly one file currently
selected.  Note that if you double-click on a file in an unrecognized
format,  <I>xv</I> will automatically display it in a TextView window.  This
command lets you view recognized image files in text mode.<BR>
Keyboard Equivalent: 
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> t
</B>
</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-159.gif" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=16></DT>
<DD>Recursively walks its way down a directory tree, starting from the
current directory, and does an 
 <B>Update</B>
 command in each subdirectory.
It will follow symbolic links, if you have any, and it's smart enough to
avoid circular links.  It gives you a nifty way to generate icons for an
entire hierarchy of image files.  It can also take a Good Long Time,
depending on your particular situation, so it pops up an annoying "Are
You Sure?" dialog box before it starts working its magic.<BR>
Keyboard Equivalent:  
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> e
</B>
</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-160.gif" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=16></DT>
<DD>Exits the  <I>xv</I> program.<BR>
Keyboard Equivalent: 
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> q
</B>
</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-161.gif" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=16></DT>
<DD>Closes this particular schnauzer window.<BR>
Keyboard Equivalent: 
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> c
</B>
</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-162.gif" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=16></DT>
<DD>Toggles whether or not 'hidden' files (in Unix, files that have a '.' as
their first character) should be displayed.<BR>
Keyboard Equivalent:  &lt;none>

</DD>
<DT><IMG SRC="fig-163.gif" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=16></DT>
<DD>Opens a dialog box that lets you select files by name.  Wildcards are
accepted.  It does  <I>not</I> clear any previously selected files.<BR>
Keyboard Equivalent:  
 <B>&lt;Ctrl> f</B>
</DD>
