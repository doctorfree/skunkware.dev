<H1>Color Allocation in <I>xv</I></H1>
<P>Allocating colors on an X11 display is not as trivial a matter as it might seem on 
first glance.   <I>xv</I> goes to a
lot of trouble to allocate colors from what is essentially a scarce 
resource.  This appendix is provided for
those inquisitive types who'd be interested in learning how to successfully 'argue' with an X server.</P>
<P>Note:  If you're using a  <I>TrueColor</I> display, you can safely ignore this 
appendix, as none of the following
actually happens on your system.  On a  <I>TrueColor</I> system, there is no 
colormap.  Pixel values directly
correspond to displayed color values.  For example, in a typical 24-bit 
 <I>TrueColor</I> display, each pixel value
is a 24-bit unsigned number, which corresponds to an 8-bit  <I>Red</I> component, 
an 8-bit  <I>Green</I> component,
and an 8-bit  <I>Blue</I>
 component, bitwise shifted and OR-ed together to form a 24-bit number.  As 
a result, all
displayable colors are always available for use.</P>
<A NAME="problem-with-pseudocolor-displays"><H2>  The Problem with PseudoColor Displays</H2></A>
<P>Most color X displays use a 'visual' model called  <I>PseudoColor</I>.  On a 
 <I>PseudoColor</I> display, pixel values
are small unsigned integers which point into a 'colormap', which contains an RGB triple for 
each possible
pixel value.  As an example, on a typical 8-bit color X display, pixel 
values can range between 0 and 255,
inclusive.  There is a 256-entry colormap which contains an RGB triple for 
each possible pixel value.
When the video display hardware sees a pixel value of '7', for instance, it 
looks up color #7 in the
colormap, and sends the RGB components found in that position of the 
colormap to the video monitor for
display.</P>
<P>In the X Window System, entries on the display's colormap (called 
colorcells) are a scarce resource.  At
any time, out of the 256 colors available (in an 8-bit  <I>PseudoColor</I> system), 
several of these colors may
already be in use by your window manager, the cursor, and other 
applications.  As such,  <I>xv</I> cannot assume
that it has 256 colors at its disposal, because it generally doesn't.</P>
<P>A word on the  <I>xv</I> color allocation policy:  The overall goal is to "make 
this one image being displayed
right now look as good as possible, without changing the colors of any 
other applications."  You can
modify this goal slightly to suit your purposes, on the off chance that 
your goal isn't the same as my goal.
See "<A HREF="control-window.html#color-allocation-commands">Color Allocation Commands"</A>
 for further details.</P>
<A NAME="s-default-color-allocation-algorithm"><H2><I>xv</I>'s Default Color Allocation Algorithm</H2></A>
<P>By default,  <I>xv</I> will allocate 'read-only' colorcells.  Since these 
colorcells cannot be changed by the
application, they can be freely shared among applications.  This is the 
default behavior because it is the
most likely to succeed in getting the colors it needs.  It does, however, 
slow down any color changes made
in the  <I>xv color editor</I> window.  If you intend to be doing any serious color 
modification, you should
probably run  <I>xv</I> with the '
 <TT>-rw</TT>
' option.</P>
<P>When allocating read-only colorcells,  <I>xv</I>
 uses a four-step process to acquire the colors it wants.</P>
<P>The first step is to sort the desired colors by order of 'importance', so 
that we ask for the most 'important'
colors first.  See "<A HREF="diversity-algorithm.html">The Diversity Algorithm"</A>
 for more details on this step.</P>
<P>The next step (Phase 1 Color Allocation) is to ask for each color in the 
list.  Colors that we failed to get
(presumably because there are no more entries available in the colormap) 
are marked for use in the Phase
2 and Phase 3 Color Allocation steps.</P>
<P>If we successfully allocated all the desired colors in Phase 1, the algorithm exits at this time.  
Otherwise, it
goes on to Phase 2.  In Phase 2, the display's colormap is examined.  For 
each color that went unallocated
in Phase 1, the program looks for the color in the display's colormap that 
is the 'nearest' match to the
originally desired color.  It then tries to allocate these 'nearest' colors as read-only colorcells.  The number
of successful allocations in Phase 2 will be displayed in the string "Got 
## 'close' colors.", visible in the
 <I>xv info</I> window.</P>
<P>If all the colors have been successfully allocated by this point, the 
algorithm exits.  Otherwise, it continues
on the Phase 3.  In Phase 3, any colors still unallocated are simply mapped 
into the 'nearest' colors that
 <I>were</I> allocated in Phase 1 or Phase 2.</P>
<A NAME="perfect-color-allocation"><H2>  'Perfect' Color Allocation</H2></A>
<P>If you'd like the image displayed "as nicely as possible on this display, 
and everything else be damned",
you can run  <I>xv</I> in 'perfect' mode, by specifying the '
 <TT>-perfect</TT>
' option on the command line.</P>
<P>In 'perfect' mode, color allocation proceeds much like it does in 
'imperfect' mode.  The colors are sorted
in decreasing order of 'importance'.  Each of these colors is then 
requested, as in the Phase 1 color
allocation code described above.</P>
<P>The big change comes on a failed allocation request.  If a color is not 
successfully allocated in Phase 1,
and this is the first failed request, we assume that the colormap is full.  
The program frees all the colors
allocated so far, creates and installs a completely new colormap.  When a 
new colormap is installed,
everything else on the screen (including other  <I>xv</I> windows) will go to hell. 
 Only the image window will
look correct.  Generally, the colormap will remain installed as long as 
your mouse is inside the image
window.  It is, however, up to your particular window manager to decide how 
multiple colormaps are
handled..</P>
<P>After the colormap has been installed, the program starts Phase 1 over 
again, allocating colors from the
new, empty colormap.  If any color allocation requests still fail, they are marked and dealt with in Phase 2.
(It is possible for allocation requests from the new, empty colormap to 
fail, as the program may be asking
for more colors than are available in a colormap.  For example, you could 
be running  <I>xv</I> on a 4- or 6-bit
display, which only would have 16 or 64 colors (respectively) in a colormap.)</P>
<P>Phase 2 operates as described above, except that it looks for 'nearest' 
matches in the newly created
colormap.  Also, since xv already owns every color in this colormap, we 
don't technically have to
'allocate' any of them in this Phase.  We already have allocated them once.</P>
<P>Note that 'perfect' mode only creates and installs a new colormap if it was 
necessary.  If all the Phase 1
color allocation requests succeeded, a new colormap will not be created.</P>
<A NAME="allocating-read-write-colors"><H2>  Allocating Read-Write Colors</H2></A>
<P>It is sometimes desirable to allocate read-write colorcells instead of 
read-only colorcells.  Read-write
colorcells cannot be shared among programs.  As such, unless you use 
'perfect' mode as well, you are
likely to successfully allocate fewer colors.  That's the disadvantage.  
The advantage is that, since  <I>xv</I>
completely owns these colorcells, it can do what it wishes with them.  
Color changes (as controlled by the
 <I>xv color editor</I> window) will happen almost instantaneously, as the program 
only has to store new RGB
values in the colorcells, rather than free all the colors and reallocate new 
 <I>different</I> colors.</P>
<P>To allocate read-write colorcells, start  <I>xv</I> with the '
 <TT>-rw</TT>
' option.  Colorcells are allocated one at a time.  If
an allocation request fails, the code stops allocating new colorcells.  (Unless 
you've also specified 'perfect'
mode.  In 'perfect' mode, the first time an allocation request fails, all 
allocated colors are freed, a new,
empty colormap is created and installed, and all colors are reallocated.  
If there is an allocation error in
this second pass, the code stops allocating new colorcells.)</P>
<P>If there are still unallocated color remaining, these colors are simply 
mapped into the closest colors that
were allocated.
