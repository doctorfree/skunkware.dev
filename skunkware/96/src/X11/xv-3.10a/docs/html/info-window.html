<A NAME="overview"><H2>  Overview</H2></A>
<P>This window displays information about the current image, color allocation, 
expansion, cropping, and any
error messages.  It can be opened by issuing the 
 <B>Image Info</B>
 command.  (Select 
 <B>Image Info</B>
 from the
 <B>Windows</B>
 menu in the  <I>xv controls</I> window, or type 
 <B>i</B>
 in any open  <I>xv</I> window.)  You can close the window
by using the 
 <B>Image Info</B>
 command while the window is open.  You can also close the window by 
clicking
anywhere inside of it.</P>
<P>The top portion of the window displays the program name, version number, 
and revision date.  It also
shows the University of Pennsylvania shield, the PennNet logo, the 
copyright notice, and of course, the
author's name.</P>
<A NAME="fields"><H2>  The Fields</H2></A>
<P>The "Filename" field displays the name of the currently loaded file.  The 
name is displayed without any
leading pathname.  If there is no currently loaded image (i.e., you're 
looking at the default image, or a
grabbed image) this field will display "&lt;none>".</P>
<P>The "Format" field displays information describing what image format the 
file is stored in, and how large
the file is (in bytes).</P>
<P>The "Resolution" field shows the width and height (in image pixels) of the 
loaded image.  Note that this
does not necessarily have anything to do with the size of the image 
currently displayed on your screen.
These numbers do not change as you modify the display image.</P>
<P>The "Cropping" field displays the current state of any cropping/selection activity.  If you are looking at the
entire (uncropped) image, this field will show "&lt;none>".  If you are 
viewing a cropped portion of an
image, this field will display something like "247x128 rectangle starting 
at 132,421".  See "<A HREF="image-window.html#cropping">Cropping"</A>
 for more details.
</P>
<P>The "Expansion" field gives you information about how the image is 
displayed.  It can display something
like "158.00% x 137.00%  (505 x 273)".  This tells you that the current 
displayed image is 505 pixels
wide and 273 pixels high, and that it is 1.58 times wider and 1.37 times 
higher than the original image
(which, in this case, had a size of 320x200).</P>
<P>The "Selection" field displays the size and position of the currently-drawn 
selection rectangle.  If there
isn't a current selection, this field will show "&lt;none>".</P>
<P>The "Colors" field gives you detailed information on how well (or poorly) 
color allocation went.  If
everything went reasonably well it will display something like:</P>
<P>Got all 67 desired colors.  (66 unique)</P>
<P>This means that 67 entries in the image's colormap were used in the image, 
but that only 66 of these
colors were different, as far as the X server is concerned.  (e.g., if 
'white' (255,255,255) was listed twice
in the image's colormap, it would only allocate one X colorcell, but would 
still count as 2 successful color
allocations).</P>
<P>See "<A HREF="color-allocation.html">Color Allocation"</A>
 for a complete discussion of how colors 
are allocated, and what the
"Colors" field can tell you.</P>
<P>Note that the fields are filled in as information becomes available.  As 
such, they can be used as a rough
'progress indicator' when loading images.  When you begin loading, all the 
fields are cleared.  Once the
image has been successfully loaded, the top three fields (Filename, Format, Resolution) are filled in.  Once
the colors have been allocated, and the display image generated, the bottom 
four fields are shown
(Cropping, Expansion, Selection, and Colors).</P>
<A NAME="status-lines"><H2>  Status Lines</H2></A>
<P>The bottom two lines in the info window display various error messages, 
warnings, and status
information.  These two lines are also duplicated in the  <I>xv controls</I> window.</P>
<P>The upper line is the more commonly used.  It normally displays a one-line 
summary of the current image
and color allocation success.  If an error occurs, it will be displayed on this line as well.</P>
<P>The lower line is used to display warning messages.</P>
