<P>Version 3.10</P>
<P>Copyright 1989, 1994, John Bradley  Thank you for acquiring a copy
of   <I>xv</I> , a pretty nifty X program.  I hope you enjoy using it,
as I've enjoyed writing it.</P>
<P>The latest version of   <I>xv</I>  (or at least a pointer to it) is
available via anonymous ftp at <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/xv">
<TT>ftp://ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/xv/</TT></A>.  If you're not sure if you have
 the latest version, or
 you are missing the source or documentation for  <I>xv</I> , PLEASE
pick up the latest version of the xv distribution.  Do   <I>not</I> 
send mail unless absolutely necessary (i.e., you don't have ftp
capability).</P>
<A NAME="licensing-information"><H2> <I>xv</I> Licensing Information</H2></A>
<P> <STRONG>xv</STRONG>  <B> is shareware for personal use only.</B></P>
<P>You may use   <I>xv</I>  for your own amusement, and if you find it
nifty, useful, generally cool,  or of some value to you, your
registration fee would be greatly appreciated.  $25 is the standard 
registration fee, though of course, larger amounts are quite welcome. 
Folks who donate $40 or more can receive a printed,  bound copy of the 
 <I>xv</I>  manual for no extra charge.  If you want one, just ask.   
<I>Be sure to specify the version of xv that you are using!</I></P>
<P> <B>Commercial, government, and institutional users </B>  <STRONG>must</STRONG>
 <B> register their copies of </B>  <STRONG>xv</STRONG>  <B>.</B></P>
<P>This does   <I>not</I>  mean that you are required to register  
<I>xv</I>  just because you play with it on the workstation in your
office. This falls under the heading of 'personal use'.  If you are a
systems  administrator, you can put   <I>xv</I>  up in a public
directory for your users' amusement.  Again, 'personal use', albeit
plural.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if you use   <I>xv</I>  in the course of doing
your work, whatever your 'work' may happen to be,  you   <I>must</I>
register your copy of   <I>xv</I> .  (Note:  If you are a student, and
you use   <I>xv</I>  to do classwork or research, you should get your
professor/teacher/advisor to purchase an appropriate number of copies.)</P>
<P> <I>xv</I>  licenses are $25 each.  You should purchase one license
per workstation,  or one per   <I>xv</I>  user, whichever is the
smaller number.    <I>xv</I>  is   <I>not</I>  sold on a 'number of
concurrent users' basis.  If   <I>xv</I>  was some $1000 program, yes,
that would be a reasonable request, but at $25, it's not.  Also, given
that   <I>xv</I>  is completely unlocked, there is no way to enforce
any 'number of concurrent users' limits, so it isn't sold that way.</P>
<P>Printed and bound copies of the 120-ish page   <I>xv</I>  manual
are available for $15 each.  Note that manuals are   <I>only</I>  sold
with, at minimum, an equal number of licenses.  (e.g.  if you purchase 5
 licenses, you can also purchase   <I>up to</I>  5 copies of the
manual)</P>
<P>The source code to the program can be had (as a compressed 'tar'
file split  over a couple 3.5" MS-DOS formatted floppies) for $15, for
those who don't have ftp capabilities.</P>
<P>Orders outside the US and Canada must add an additional $5 per
manual  ordered to cover the additional shipping charges.</P>
<P>Checks, money orders, and purchase orders are accepted.  Credit
cards are  not.  All forms of payment must be payable in US Funds. 
Checks must be payable through a US bank (or a US  branch of a non-US
bank).  Purchase orders for less than $50, while still accepted, are not
encouraged.</P>
<P>All payments should be payable to 'John Bradley', and mailed to:</P>

<A NAME="site-licenses"><H3>Site Licenses</H3></A>
<P>If you are planning to purchase 10 or more licenses, site licenses
are available, at a substantial discount.   Site licenses let you run  
<I>xv</I>  on any and all computing equipment at the site, for any
purpose  whatsoever.  The site license covers the current version of  
<I>xv</I> , and any versions released within one year of the licensing
date.  You are  also allowed to duplicate and distribute an unlimited
number of copies of the   <I>xv</I>  manual, but only for use within
the site.  Covered versions of the software may be run in perpetuity.</P>
<P>Also, it should be noted that a 'site' can be defined as anything
you'd  like.  It can be a physical location (a room, building, location,
etc.), an organization (a workgroup, department,  division, etc.) or any
other logical grouping ("the seventeen technical writers scattered about
our company", etc.).  The site license cost will be based on your
estimate of the number of   <I>xv</I>  users or workstations at your
site, whichever is the smaller number.</P>
<P>If you are interested in obtaining a site license, please contact
the  author via electronic mail or FAX (see below for details).  Send
information regarding your site (the name or definition of  the 'site',
a physical address, a fax number, and an estimate of the number of users
or workstations), and we'll get a site license out to you for your
examination.</P>

email). Arrangements can probably be worked out.</P>
