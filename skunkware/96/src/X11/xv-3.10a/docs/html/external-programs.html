<A NAME="bggen"><H2>  bggen</H2></A>
<P>Syntax:
 <B>bggen</B>
 [-h  <I>high</I>] [-w  <I>wide</I>] [-b  <I>bits</I>] [-g  <I>geom</I>] [-d  <I>disp</I>] [-a] [-r  <I>rot</I>] [-G  <I>rptgeom</I>]
 <I>color1 </I>[ <I>color2</I> ...  <I>colorN</I>]</P>
<P> <I>bggen</I> generates background gradients for use with  <I>xv</I>.  It does not directly 
display anything itself.
Instead, it generates an appropriately sized PPM file, which  <I>xv</I>
 can display.  It is also used by the  <I>xv</I>'s 
 <B>Pad</B>
command, for a similar purpose.</P>
<P>By default,  <I>bggen </I>will generate a screen-sized PPM file with a vertical 
color gradient.  The top of the
image will be in  <I>color1</I>, the bottom of the image will be in  <I>colorN</I>, and 
intermediate positions will have
an appropriate intermediate color.  You can list as many colors as you'd 
like.  If you only list one color,
the entire image will be that single color.</P>
<P>Color specifications can be in one of three formats:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
A color name (e.g. 'lightblue') known to your X server.  Use the  <I>showrgb</I> 
command to get a
(gigantic) list of known colors.</LI>
<LI>
An X11-style hexadecimal RGB color specification (e.g. '#00ff00'), where the first two hex digits
specify the red value, the middle two specify the green value, and the last 
two specify the blue
value.  Note that the '#' character is treated specially in some shells, 
and to be on the safe side
you should either protect it by putting a '\\' character in front of it, or 
wrap the whole color
specification in single-quotes.</LI>
<LI> 
Three integers, in the 0-255 range, separated by spaces (e.g.  0 255 0).  
This is mainly for
backward compatibility, as it was the only format understood by previous versions of 
 <I>bggen</I>.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Options:</P>
<DL>
<DT>-d  <I>disp</I></DT>
<DD>Specifies the name of the X display that the program should talk to. 
  <I>bggen</I>
needs to connect to an X display to determine the screen size (which is
used as the default image size), and to parse color names.  It is not
 <I>necessary</I> for  <I>bggen</I> to connect to an X display.  If it can't, you will have 
to
specify an image size (see below), and you'll have to use the numeric
format to enter color specifications.</DD>
<DT>-g  <I>geom</I></DT>
<DD>Specifies the size of the generated image.   <I>geom</I> should be in the 
format:
 <I>wide</I>
 <B>x</B>
 <I>high</I> (e.g.  '1024x768').  If you don't specify a size, the image will
default to the size of your display, assuming it was able to connect to your
display.</DD>
<DT>-w  <I>wide</I> -h  <I>high</I></DT>
<DD>Another way to specify the size of the generated image.  
Provided for
backward compatibility.</DD>
<DT>-G  <I>rptgeom</I></DT>
<DD>Sets the size of the gradient.  Normally, the gradient will be 
the size of the
image.  However, if you wish, you make the gradient smaller than the
image; the gradient will repeat as often as necessary to fill the image</DD>
<DT>-r  <I>rot</I></DT>
<DD>Lets you rotate the gradient.  Normally, the gradient is aligned 
vertically,
with the first color at the top, and the last color at the bottom.  Using 
this
option, you can rotate the whole mess by an arbitrary amount.   <I>rot</I> should
be specified in degrees.  Positive values rotate the gradient counter-
clockwise.
</DD>
<DT>-a</DT>
<DD>If supplied,  <I>bggen</I> will generate a PPM 'ascii' file, rather than the 
default
PPM 'raw' format.</DD>
<DT>-b  <I>bits</I></DT>
<DD>Specifies the number of significant bits to use in the RGB color
specifications in the output image.  It must range between 1 and 8,
inclusive.  Use values less than 8 (the default) to limit color use by
increasing the color granularity.  Since  <I>xv</I> can do this sort of thing 
better,
this is of dubious value.</DD>
</DL>
<A NAME="xcmap"><H2>  xcmap</H2></A>
<P>This is a little X program I wrote years ago to help me debug  <I>xv</I>'s color 
allocation code.  It displays the
contents of the default colormap as (typically) a 16x16 grid of colored 
rectangles.  Run it, and then run
something that allocates colors (such as  <I>xv</I>), and you'll see the color 
cells changing color.  It can give you
an indication of how full your colortable is, and whatnot.  It only works 
on displays where the default
visual is a PseudoColor visual, but that's nearly all of them, so it shouldn't be a problem.</P>
<P>There are two standard X options:  '-d  <I>display</I>' to set the X display, and 
'-g  <I>geom</I>', to set the default
window size and position.</P>
<P>You can click in the window to examine the RGB values of various color 
cells.  I have not found a useful
purpose for this feature, but there must have been one at one time...</P>
<P>Type 'q' in the window to exit the program.</P>
<A NAME="pictoppm"><H2>  xvpictoppm</H2></A>
<P>This program is a standard Unix filter that reads the 'thumbnail' files 
created by the  <I>visual schnauzer</I>
(from 
 <TT>stdin</TT>
) and writes standard PPM versions of same (to 
 <TT>stdout</TT>
).  The thumbnail files are small
(80x60 maximum) 8-bit versions of your image files and are used as the 
icons in the  <I>visual schnauzer</I>.
These files are stored in my own weird format (one optimized for my 
purposes), but many folks have
asked for a way to turn them into standard image files, for use on their WWW pages, or whatever.</P>
<P>Anyway, assuming you've done an 
 <B>Update</B>
 or 
 <B>Generate Icons</B>
 command in the  <I>visual schnauzer</I>, you'll
find the thumbnail version of an image stored with the same name in the '
 <TT>.xvpics</TT>
' subdirectory.  For
example, if you have a file '
 <TT>/pics/gif/foobie.gif</TT>
', you would find the thumbnail version of it in
the file '
 <TT>/pics/gif/.xvpics/foobie.gif</TT>
'.</P>
<A NAME="cjpeg-djpeg"><H2>  cjpeg and djpeg</H2></A>
<P>These two programs are distributed as part of the Independent JPEG Group's 
software, located in the
 <TT>jpeg</TT>
 subdirectory of the  <I>xv</I> source.  They perform command-line conversion 
between JPEG and the
PPM/PGM, GIF, BMP and Targa formats.  Since  <I>xv</I> has absolutely no 
command-line or 'batch'
conversion abilities, you may find these useful if you want to convert a 
lot of images, or automatically
convert images from a script.  If this is the case, you should probably get 
Jef Poskanzer's most-excellent
 <I>pbmplus</I> package, which you can get via anonymous ftp on 
 <TT>ftp.x.org</TT>
 and elsewhere..</P>
<A NAME="vdcomp"><H2>  vdcomp</H2></A>
<P>Uncompresses compressed PDS and VICAR images.  Beyond that, I know nothing.</P>
