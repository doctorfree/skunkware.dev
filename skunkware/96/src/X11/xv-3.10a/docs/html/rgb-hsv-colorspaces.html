<H1>RGB &amp; HSV Colorspaces</H1>
<P>Both the RGB and HSV Colorspaces define a method of uniquely specifying colors via three numbers.</P>
<P>The RGB colorspace is the more commonly used of the two.  For example, most 
color monitors operate on
RGB inputs.  In RGB colorspace, each color is represented by a three number 
'triple'.  The components of
this triple specify, respectively, the amount of red, the amount of green, 
and the amount of blue in the
color.  In most computer graphics systems (and in  <I>xv</I>), these values are 
represented as 8-bit unsigned
numbers.  Thus, each component has a range of 0-255, inclusive, with 0 
meaning 'no output', and 255
meaning 'full output'.</P>
<P>The eight 'primary' colors in the RGB colorspace, and their values in the 
standard 8-bit unsigned range
are:</P>
<PRE>Black    (  0,  0,  0)
Red      (255,  0,  0)
Green    (  0,255,  0)
Yellow   (255,255,  0)
Blue     (  0,  0,255)
Magenta  (255,  0,255)
Cyan     (  0,255,255)
White    (255,255,255)</PRE>
<P>Other colors are specified by intermediate values.  For example,  <I>orange</I> is 
chromatically between red and
yellow on the color spectrum.  To get an  <I>orange</I>, you can simply average  <I>red</I> 
(255,0,0) and  <I>yellow</I>
(255,255,0) on a component-by-component basis resulting in (255,127,0), 
which will be some  <I>orange</I>-ish
color.</P>
<P>You can change the brightness of the colors by raising or lowering all of 
their components by some factor.
For example, if (0,255,255) is  <I>cyan</I> (it is), then (0,128,128) would be a 
 <I>dark cyan</I>.</P>
<P>Saturation of a color is a measure of how 'pure' the color is.  Desaturated 
colors will appear washed-out,
or pastel, whereas saturated colors will be bold and vibrant, the sort of 
colors you'd paint a sports car.  In
the RGB colorspace, you can desaturate colors by adding  <I>white</I> to them.  For 
example, if you take  <I>red</I>
(255,0,0), and add a  <I>medium grey</I> to it (128,128,128), you'll get a shade of 
 <I>pink</I> (255,128,128).  Note that
the component values are 'clipped' to remain in the range 0-255.</P>
<P>The HSV colorspace works somewhat differently.  It is considered by many to 
be more intuitive to use,
closer to how an artist actually mixes colors.</P>
<P>In the HSV colorspace, each color is again determined by a three-component 
'triple'.  The first
component,  <I>Hue</I>, describes the basic color in terms of its angular position 
on a 'color wheel'.  In this
particular implementation, Hue is described in terms of degrees.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, since this document isn't printed in color, it is not 
possible to show this 'color wheel' in
any meaningful way.  Here is where the 'primary' colors live:</P>
<PRE>Red       0
Yellow   60
Green   120
Cyan    180
Blue    240
Magenta 300
</PRE>
<P>The colors appear in the same order that they do on a standard color 
spectrum, except that they form a
circle, with magenta looping back to red.</P>
<P>As with the RGB space, in-between colors are represented by in-between 
values.  For example,  <I>orange</I>
would have a Hue value of 30, being situated roughly halfway between  <I>red</I>
 and  <I>yellow</I>.
</P>
<P>The second component of the HSV triple is  <I>Saturation</I>, which, as described 
above, can be thought of as
"how pure the color is".  In this implementation, saturation can range 
between 0 and 100, inclusive.
Colors with a saturation of 100 are fully-saturated, whereas colors with a 
saturation of 0 are completely
desaturated (in other words,  <I>grey</I>).</P>
<P>The third component of the HSV triple is  <I>Value</I>
, which really should be called  <I>Intensity</I>.  It is a measure of
how 'bright' the color is.  In this implementation, Value can range between 
0 and 100, inclusive.  A color
with a Value component of 100 will be as bright as possible, and a color 
with a Value component of 0 will
be as dark as possible (i.e.,  <I>black</I>).
