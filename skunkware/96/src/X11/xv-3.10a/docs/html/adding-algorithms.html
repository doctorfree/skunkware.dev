<H1>Adding Algorithms to <I>xv</I></H1>
<P>With the addition of the 
 <B>Algorithms</B>
 menu in the  <I>xv controls</I> window,  <I>xv</I> can now perform standard
image-processing algorithms.  However, I'm not really into the whole image
-processing  <I>scene</I>, so I've
only implemented a few algorithms.</P>
<P>Please!  Feel free to add your own algorithms, it's easy, and if you'd care 
to donate them, they may find
their way into future official releases of  <I>xv</I>, and eternal fame and glory 
will be yours, in the form of a
credit in the "Hall of Fame" listing..</P>
<A NAME="adding-an-algorithm"><H2>  Adding an Algorithm</H2></A>
<P>For the purposes of this example, I'll be adding a new algorithm called 
'Noise' which will simply add (or
subtract) a small random amount from each pixel in the image.  I can't see that this would be a very 
useful
algorithm (which is why it's not already  <I>in xv</I>
), but then again, what do I know about such things...</P>
<P>Edit 
 <TT>xv.h</TT>
, and find the block that starts with:</P>
<PRE>#define ALG_NONE  0
#define ALG_SEP1  1  /* separator */
#define ALG_BLUR3 2</PRE>
<P>and add an additional definition at the end of the list (right before 
 <TT>ALG_MAX</TT>
) for your algorithm.  Don't
forget to increment 
 <TT>ALG_MAX</TT>
 to reflect the additional algorithm:</P>
<PRE>#define ALG_TINF  6
#define ALG_OIL   7
#define ALG_NOISE 8
#define ALG_MAX   9</PRE>
<P>
Edit 
 <TT>xvctrl.c</TT>
, and find where the array 
 <TT>algMList[]</TT>
 is initialized.  Add a string for your new
algorithm.  The string's position in the list must match the number that 
you assigned to the 
 <TT>ALG_*</TT>
 value
in 
 <TT>xv.h</TT>
:</P>
<PRE>static char *algMList[] = { "Undo All",
                            MBSEP,
                            "Blur (3x3)",
                            "Blur (7x7)",
                            "Edge Detection",
                            "Emboss",
                            "Oil Painting",
                            "Add Noise"};</PRE>
<P>Edit 
 <TT>xvalg.c</TT>
, and find the 
 <TT>DoAlg()</TT>
 function.  This function is called with an 
 <TT>ALG_*</TT>
 value whenever
something is selected from the 
 <B>Algorithms</B>
 menu.  Add a case for the new 
 <TT>ALG_NOISE</TT>
 value, and have it
call your top-level function, with no parameters:</P>
<PRE>  case ALG_TINF:  EdgeDetect(1);  break;
  case ALG_OIL:   OilPaint();     break;
  case ALG_NOISE: Noise();       break;
   }</PRE>

<P>Write your top-level function:</P>
<PRE>/************************/
static void Noise()
{
  byte *pic24, *tmpPic;
  /* turn on flapping fish cursor */
  WaitCursor();
  /* mention progress... */
  SetISTR(ISTR_INFO, "Running Noise algorithm...");
  /* generates a 24-bit version of </TT> <TT>pic</TT> <TT>, if necessary.
     also generates a w*h*3 buffer (tmpPic) to hold intermediate results */
  if (start24bitAlg(&amp;pic24, &amp;tmpPic)) return;
  /* do the noise algorithm */
  doNoise(pic24, pWIDE,pHIGH, tmpPic);</P>
<P>  /* if we're in PIC8 mode, convert pic24 back to PIC8. free pic24 &amp; tmppic */
  end24bitAlg(pic24, tmpPic);
}</PRE>
<P>Now write the function that does the work of your algorithm.  It will be 
passed a 24-bit RGB source image
 <I>srcpic</I>, its dimensions  <I>w,h,</I> and a destination 24-bit image  <I>dstpic</I> of the 
same size.  If your algorithm is
normally meant to be run on greyscale images (as so many image algorithms 
are), you should simply run
it separately for each of the  <I>Red, Green, </I>and  <I>Blue</I> planes, and glue the 
results back together at the end of
the algorithm.</P>
<PRE>/************************/
static void doNoise(srcpic, w, h, dstpic)
  byte *srcpic, *dstpic;
  int   w, h;
{
  byte *sp, *dp;
  int   x,y,newr,newg,newb;

  printUTime("start of doNoise");   /* print timing info */

  for (y=0; y&lt;h; y++) {
    if ((y &amp; 15) == 0) WaitCursor();

    sp = srcpic + y*w*3;     /* position sp,dp at start of line #y */
    dp = dstpic + y*w*3;
    for (x=0; x&lt;w; x++) {
      newr = sp[0] + (random()&amp;0x3f)-0x20;  /* add noise to red   component */
      newg = sp[1] + (random()&amp;0x3f)-0x20;  /* add noise to green component */
      newb = sp[2] + (random()&amp;0x3f)-0x20;  /* add noise to blue  component */
      RANGE(newr, 0, 255);   /* clip values to range[0..255] inclusive */
      RANGE(newg, 0, 255);   /* RANGE() is defined in xv.h */
      RANGE(newb, 0, 255);
      dp[0] = (byte) newr;   /* store new values in dstpic */
      dp[1] = (byte) newg;
      dp[2] = (byte) newb;

      sp += 3;  dp += 3;     /* advance to next 3-byte pixel in images */
    }
  }
  printUTime("end of doConvolv");
}</PRE>
<P>Note that this algorithm is written in about as non-optimal a way as possible, for the sake of clarity.</P>
<P>Also note that if you define 
 <TT>TIMING_TEST</TT>
 at the beginning of 
 <TT>xvalg.c</TT>
, it will turn on code that will
let you measure the CPU time your algorithm requires.  Once you have a working algorithm, 
you may find
this useful if you wish to try to optimize your algorithm for increased performance.</P>
<P>And that's all there is to it!
