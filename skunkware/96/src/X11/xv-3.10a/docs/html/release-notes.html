<BODY><H1>Release Notes</H1>
<P>The following is a short synopsis of the major features that have
been  added to  <I>xv</I> since Version 3.00.  See the   <TT>CHANGELOG</TT>
 file in the  <I>xv</I>  source directory for complete details, and
up-to-the-minute information.</P>
<UL>
 <LI>Image cut and paste capabilities.</LI>
 <LI>Minimal image editing (line drawing, text annotation, and
  smudging).</LI>
 <LI>Additional choices in the   <B>Algorithms</B>  menu.  Also,
  algorithms now operate on the selected region of the image, if any.</LI>
 <LI>Image padding.</LI>
 <LI>Added a   <B>Print</B>  command.</LI>
 <LI>Additional file formats:  XPM files and 24-bit Targa files can
  both be read  and written, as can a variety of the Amiga ILBM formats
  (commonly called 'IFF' files).   <I>xv </I>can  read (but not write)
  the XWD (X Window Dump) format.  Also,  <I>xv</I> can now read 16-bit
  greyscale  'pgmraw' files, however, the low-order 8-bits will be
  discarded.</LI>
 <LI>Much improved   <B>Grab</B>  command.  It is now possible to
  grab pull-down menus in other programs.</LI>
 <LI>Much improved selection rectangle handling.</LI>
 <LI>Image 'panning' when zoomed in.</LI>
 <LI>Improved 24-to-8-bit algorithm.</LI>
 <LI>Filename completion in the  <I>load</I> and  <I>save</I>
  windows.</LI>
 <LI>Changed command-line handling.  All the 'flag' arguments
  ('-perfect',  '-smooth', etc.) are forced 'on' if you start them with a
  '-', and are forced 'off' if you start  them with a '+'.  (They used to
  toggle the state, which could lead to unpredictable results.)</LI>
 <LI>Support for 'gzip'ed files.</LI>
 <LI>Sniffs out the 'best' visual type to use, rather than simply
  using the default visual.</LI>
 <LI>New versions of Sam Leffler's  <I>libtiff</I> TIFF i/o library
  (version 3.3) and  the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG i/o library
  (version 5a) have been merged in.</LI>
 <LI>When viewing 24-bit images (in 24-bit mode) on an 8-bit
  display,  <I>xv</I> now  uses a 4*8*4 standard RGB colormap, rather
  than the 6*6*6 colormap it used in 3.00.  This colormap uses fewer 
  colors, and produces better looking results, on average.</LI>
</LI>
<P>Of course, there have been plenty of bug fixes and minor
enhancements.  It  would probably be safe to say that there's some
exciting new bugs, too!</P>
