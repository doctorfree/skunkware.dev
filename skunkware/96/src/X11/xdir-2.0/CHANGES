                  *    What's New in LLNL XDIR 2.0    *
                  *************************************

  Fixed a problem:
  ----------------

  o Added fix to Imakefile to work around a template problem on Solaris 2.4.


                  *************************************
                  *   What's New in LLNL XDIR 2.0b3   *
                  *************************************

  Changed functionality:
  ----------------------

  o Ctrl-C added as keyboard accelerator for "Close" in directory windows.


  Fixed some problems:
  --------------------

  o Fixed bug that prevented SOCKSified executable from successfully
    connecting to remote host.  A result of this fix is that the STOP
    button will have no effect during connections to remote hosts made
    with SOCKSified executable.

  o Added more porting patches for UnixWare.

  o Fixed problems with "Edit History" dialog on SCO systems.


                  *************************************

  New functionality:
  ------------------

  o A new user preference "Stop Button Blinking" was added to control
    whether the STOP button blinks or not.

  Fixed some problems:
  --------------------

  o Added porting patch for UnixWare.

  o Minor change to Imakefile for Solaris.

  o Changed the volume of error/alert beeps to user's base level.  It had
    been set to the loudest bell volume supported by the X server.

  o Improved some ambiguously worded warning dialogs.

  o Added porting patches for AIX 3.2.4.


                  *************************************
                  *   What's New in LLNL XDIR 2.0b1   *
                  *************************************

  New functionality:
  ------------------

  o  The LLNL XDIR button in the upper right corner of the directory
     window now transforms into a "Stop" button during most time-consuming
     operations.

     area by holding down the third mouse button.

  o  The number of files to transferred and to be transferred is now
     reported in the file transfer dialog.

  o  User now has option of caching directory lists from remote hosts
     during a session, allowing fast redisplay of previously visited
     directories.  This feature is controlled by the "C" mode button
     in the toolbar and by the general preferences "Initial Cache Mode"
     and "Max Dir Cache Len (KB).

  o  Added a new dialog, "Edit History", for editing history information
     (accessible via the "File" menu).

  o  Added menu for changing to ancestor directory.  This menu is accessible
     in two ways: (1) As a pullright in the "Goto" menu and (2) as a right-
     mouse-button popup in the "Up Arrow".

  o  Now able to search for strings in built-in viewer.

  o  Now can specify starting directory for local host on execute line.


  Changed functionality:
  ----------------------

  o  Dropping entries onto another directory window will always initiate
     a copy or move operation (before, it was a noop to drop entries onto
     a file name in another window).

  o  The user preference "Auto Refresh" was removed.

  o  The user preference "Add To Cache" was removed.

  o  Made following name changes to general preferences:
         "Directory Cache Size"    -->  "Max Dir Name History"
         "Host Cache Size"         -->  "Max Host Name History"
         "User Cache Size"         -->  "Max User Name History"
         "Wildcard Cache Size"     -->  "Max Quoted Cmd History"
         "Quoted Cmd Cache Size"   -->  "History Sort Order"

  o  The configuration parameters in the General Preferences dialog are
     now organized by category.

  o  Changed keyboard accelerators for "Search" and "Search Again" menu
     items to Ctrl-F and Ctrl-G, respectively.

  o  Initial width of built-in viewer now determined by examining file
     to be viewed.  (See general preference "Initial Max Viewer Width").

  o  Replaced diamond-shaped tree controls with triangles.

  o  Made diagnostics window taller.


  Fixed some problems:
  --------------------

  o  Fixed bug that could cause LLNL XDIR to mysteriously dump core while
     a file is being viewed.  (Thanks to Mark Crimmins for tracking down
     this bug.)

  o  Fixed bugs that prevented Full Info Mode from working correctly with
     some VMS FTP servers.

  o  Fixed a scrolling bug that could crash some servers.

  o  Fixed bug caused the "Initial Search Case Match" user preference to
     have the opposite of the desired effect.

  o  Fixed a bug that made it possible under very special circumstances
     to simultaneously display the same directory in two different windows.

  o  Increased robustness of file transfer abort logic.

  o  Added porting patches for QNX/OS.

  o  Added porting patches for NEWS-OS 4.2.

  o  Anonymous user names of form "anonymous@host" and "ftp@host" are now
     put into the Connect to Anonymous dialog's scrolled list.

  o  Online help now more robust.

  o  Add porting patches for Solaris 2.4 with IXI Motif.

  o  Added kludge to correct listing of NSL UniTree directories in tree
     and full info modes.


                  *************************************
                  *   What's New in LLNL XDIR 1.1b1   *
                  *************************************

The file transfer logic was rewritten in order to implement the following
new functionality:

  o  The ability to automatically stage and read Unitree files that are
     not on disk.

  o  The ability for the user to specify (via a new user preference,
     OVERWRITE DIR ON COPY) whether it is okay to overwrite an existing
     directory when recursively copying another directory with the same
     name.


  Fixed some problems:
  --------------------

  o  Fixed bug that could, under some circumstances, prevent the sink
     directory window from being updated when a file transfer or move
     operation completes.

  o  Fixed bug that could cause a connection to certain VMS FTP servers
     to be lost if an operation is performed on an empty directory.

  o  User names with embedded spaces now correctly handled by connection
     dialogs.

  o  Plugged some memory leaks.

  o  Fixed bug that could sometimes cause directory entries to be listed
     slightly out of order.

  o  Xdir now works with versions 2.3 and 2.4 of FTPd, a Macintosh FTP
     server.

  o  Improved logic for aborting file transfers from Unitree to local host.

  o  Fixed problem in cache file ($HOME/.xdircache): Due to an earlier bug,
     the labels "User:" and "Quote:" were switched.  The first line of the
     cache file is now "Cache Version 2" to distinguish between good and
     bad cache files.


  Other minor changes:
  --------------------

  o  Added a command line option, "-color," which forces LLNL XDIR to use
     a nice color scheme, even if the application defaults file, XDir, is
     not found.

  o  By default, tunneling mode is now "On".

  o  Processing of "quoted" command now continues if a 3xx reply is received
     from the FTP server.

o  Fixed bug that caused the type-to-select mechanism to work incorrectly
   in tree layout mode if entry to be selected follows an expanded sub-
   directory.

   are dropped onto a name/icon of a directory that is displayed in its
   own window.

   default.
