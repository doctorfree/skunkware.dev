                    *************************************
                    *   New Features in LLNL XDIR 2.0   *
                    *************************************

  Major New Functionality:
  ------------------------

  o  The "LLNL XDIR" button in the upper right corner of the directory
     window now transforms into a blinking "Stop" button during most
     time-consuming operations.  Click on the Stop button to interrupt
     the operation.  A new user preference, "Stop Button Blinking",
     controls whether the stop button blinks while displayed.

  o  You now have the option of caching directory lists from remote hosts
     during a session, allowing fast redisplay of previously visited
     directories.  This feature is controlled by the "C" mode button
     in the toolbar and by the general preferences "Initial Cache Mode"
     and "Max Dir Cache Len (KB)".

  o  You can now search for strings in the built-in viewer.

  o  You can use a new dialog, "Edit History", for editing history
     information.  The dialog is accessible via the "File" menu.


  Minor New Functionality:
  ------------------------

  o  You now have the ability to specify (via a new user preference,
     "Overwrite Dir on Copy") whether it is okay to overwrite an existing
     directory when recursively copying another directory with the same
     name.

  o  Now the copy (i.e., file transfer) operation automatically stages
     and read Unitree files that are not on disk.

  o  You can now pop up the launch commands menu in the directory list
     area by holding down the third mouse button.

  o  The number of files to transfer and to be transferred is now
     reported in the file transfer dialog.

  o  Initial width of built-in viewer is now determined by examining file
     to be viewed.  (See general preference "Initial Max Viewer Width").

  o  A new command line option, "-color," forces LLNL XDIR to use a nice
     color scheme, even if the application defaults file, XDir, is not
     found.

  o  A menu is now available for changing to an ancestor directory.  This
     menu is accessible in two ways: (1) As a pullright in the "Goto"
     menu and (2) as a right-mouse-button popup in the "Up Arrow" button
     of the toolbar.

  o  You can now specify starting directory for local host on the command
     line.

  o  SOCKS firewall support.


  Changed Functionality:
  ------------------------

  o  Dropping entries onto another directory window will always initiate
     a copy or move operation (before, it was a noop to drop entries onto
     a file name in another window).

  o  The user preference "Auto Refresh" was removed.

  o  The user preference "Add To Cache" was removed.

  o  The following name changes were made to the general preferences:

         "Directory Cache Size"    -->  "Max Dir Name History"
         "Host Cache Size"         -->  "Max Host Name History"
         "User Cache Size"         -->  "Max User Name History"
         "Wildcard Cache Size"     -->  "Max Quoted Cmd History"
         "Quoted Cmd Cache Size"   -->  "History Sort Order"

  o  The configuration parameters in the General Preferences dialog are
     now organized by category.

  o  The keyboard accelerators for the "Search" and "Search Again" menu
     items have been changed to Ctrl-F and Ctrl-G, respectively.

  o  The diamond-shaped tree controls have been replaced with triangles.

  o  The diagnostics window is now taller.

  o  By default, tunneling mode is now "On".

  o  Processing of "quoted" command now continues if a 3xx reply is received
     from the FTP server.
