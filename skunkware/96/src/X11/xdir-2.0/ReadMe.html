<STRONG>NAME</STRONG>
  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> - A graphical network-oriented file manager


<STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>
  xdir [options] [directory path]


<STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> provides a graphical user interface for file
  transfer and for direct manipulation of local and remote
  directories on UNIX (and a number of non-UNIX) platforms.
  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> offers the ability to view directory information
  in four different formats, ranging from long lists to tree
  structures.  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> is based on UNIX, the C programming
  language, OSF/Motif and FTP; hence, <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> is highly
  portable.

  With <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM>, you can manage virtually all of your files
  in a network.  Specifically, <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> can be used to browse
  directory structures, transfer files and directories, view
  local and remote files, delete files and directories, rename
  files and directories, and search directories on one or more
  hosts for entries matching a specified pattern.

  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> simultaneously displays any number of directories
  of any number of (local or remote) hosts, with each
  directory being displayed in its own window.  Several
  existing products are able to manage files on a single
  system, but <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> extends this capability to manage
  files on an entire network.

  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> does not have a "main" window, as such, but
  instead consists of a number of windows, each of which
  displays the contents of a local or remote host's directory.
  Each of these "directory windows" has a complete set of
  controls for setting modes and invoking operations.  Several
  other windows are provided for setting general preferences
  and displaying diagnostic information.

  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> offers elaborate directory-browsing functionality.
  Each directory can be viewed in several different formats,
  ranging from long lists to tree structures.  A number of
  mechanisms are provided to traverse directory structures,
  including: (1) double-clicking a directory name/icon to
  enter that directory, (2) a "go to parent directory" button,
  (3) a "go to home directory" button, and (4) a sophisticated
  history mechanism for easily reentering previously visited
  directories.

  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> provides powerful file transfer capability using
  drag-and-drop.  It is just as easy to copy a file between
  two remote systems as it is to copy a file from the local
  host to itself.  Files and directories may be transferred
  either singly or in groups with just a few movements of the
  mouse.

  One of <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM>'s most powerful features is its ability to
  search directory structures for entry names matching a
  specified pattern.  You are able to specify the range and
  depth of such searches.  The search can be restricted to a
  single subdirectory or can extend across machine boundaries.

  With <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM>, you are able to view local or remote files,
  using either the built-in viewer or any combination of
  external viewers of your choice (e.g., <EM>emacs</EM> or <EM>xv)</EM>.

  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM>'s history mechanism makes it simple to establish a
  connection with a remote host.  This and other features make
  it especially painless to connect to an anonymous FTP site.

  A number of directory-manipulation features are provided for
  operating on selected entries.  There are several ways to
  select a group of directory entries to operate on, including
  direct toggling of entries, sweeping out a rectangular area,
  and wildcard selection.  Once entries are selected, you are
  able to rename entries, delete entries (including entire
  subdirectories), or move entries between directories within
  the same host.  You are also able to create directories,
  both on local and remote hosts.

  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> utilizes a history mechanism for automatically
  saving (1) wildcard expressions used in selecting directory
  entries, (2) previously visited directories, (3) host/user
  name pairs used in connecting to remote hosts, and (4) low-
  level "quoted" commands sent to the host's FTP server.  The
  purpose of this mechanism is to reduce the amount of typing
  and mouse movement required.  For example, when you wish to
  apply a wildcard expression to select directory entries to
  operate on, a list of recently referenced wildcard
  expressions for that host will be presented; you can then
  double-click on an existing wildcard expression to apply it.
  The histories are automatically preserved across <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM>
  sessions.

  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> presents a graphical user interface for easily
  tailoring the program's behavior.  You are able to specify
  such things as whether you would like the delete operation
  to first pop up a verification dialog listing the entries to
  be deleted.

  Finally, an extensive on-line help facility, much of which
  is contextual, is provided.  However, experience has shown
  that the user interface is so intuitive that the user rarely
  needs to access the help package.

<STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line
  options, as well as the following option:

  -color
	   Force <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> to use a nice color scheme, even if the
	   application defaults file, <EM>XDir</EM>, is not found.

<STRONG>GETTING</STRONG> <STRONG>STARTED</STRONG>
  When <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> is started, a window appears that displays
  the contents of a directory on the local host.  This window
  is called a "directory window."  You can have any number of
  directory windows for any number of hosts.

  Use the <EM>Connect</EM> menu to connect to a remote host.  Select
  <EM>Connect</EM> <EM>to</EM> <EM>Anonymous</EM> to connect to an anonymous FTP site.
  Choose <EM>Connect</EM> <EM>to</EM> <EM>Remote</EM> to connect to other remote hosts.
  A directory window will be created for the specified host.

  You can use a host's directory window to create another
  directory window for that host,  First make sure that
  tunneling mode is off for that directory window (using the
  tunnel icon in the toolbar).  Then, simply change to another
  undisplayed directory by using any of the following
  techniques: (1) double-click an entry name or icon that
  represents a directory, (2) press the "go to parent
  directory" button (the up-arrow button in the toolbar), (3)
  press the "go to home directory" button (the house button in
  the toolbar), or (4) select an item in the <EM>Goto</EM> menu.  If
  tunneling mode happens to be on, the current directory
  window is used to display the specified directory.

  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> has several mechanisms to aid you in managing a
  proliferation of directory windows: (1) directory windows
  may be individually iconified (using the window manager),
  (2) all iconified <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> windows can be redisplayed by
  selecting <EM>Deiconify</EM> <EM>All</EM> in the <EM>File</EM> menu, (3) any request to
  display a directory that is iconified or buried under other
  windows causes its directory window to be brought to the
  front, and (4) the <EM>Wins</EM> menu can be used to identify
  existing directory windows and bring them to the front.

  Change between different formats for displaying information
  within a directory window by toggling the layout buttons in
  the directory window's toolbar.

  Many operations require that entries in a directory window
  first be selected.  Select/deselect entries by (1) single-
  clicking on an entry (which toggles its selection state),
  (2) holding the left mouse button down and dragging to sweep
  out a selection rectangle (which individually toggles each
  entry's selection state), (3) selecting any of the items in
  the directory window's <EM>Select</EM> menu, or (4) typing a sequence
  of characters into a directory window to select the first
  entry that most closely matches the characters.

  Copy (i.e., transfer) selected entries by using the left
  mouse button to drag the entries.  The drop site of the drag
  can be (1) the background of another directory window, (2) a
  directory entry in any directory window (including the
  source directory window).  Directories, as well as files,
  can be transferred.  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> does not permit transfers
  from a remote host to itself.  The desired file transfer
  mode can be specified by using the option menu in the
  toolbar of any directory window.

  Move selected entries by using the left mouse button to drag
  the entries, and holding down the control key when the mouse
  button is released over the drop site.  (A move differs from
  a transfer in that (1) the source entries are destroyed, and
  (2) a move is usually implemented by manipulating file
  system pointers rather than by actually copying bits.)  The
  drop site of the drag may be (1) the background of another
  directory window, (2) a directory entry in any directory
  window (including the source directory window).  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM>
  only allows moves from a host to itself.

  View selected files by selecting <EM>View</EM> <EM>Selected</EM> <EM>Entries</EM> in
  the directory window's <EM>Ops</EM> menu.  Also, you may double-click
  on an entry that <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> knows not to be a directory.
  Configure the viewer by selecting item <EM>Viewer</EM> <EM>Preferences</EM> in
  the <EM>Prefs</EM> menu.  Be sure to first set the file transfer mode
  by using the option menu in the toolbar of any directory
  window.

  Delete selected entries by pressing the trash can button in
  the toolbar.  Directories, as well as files, may be deleted.

  Search for an entry that matches a specified wildcard
  expression by selecting <EM>Search</EM> in the <EM>Ops</EM> menu.  You are
  able to specify the range and depth of the search.  After a
  match has been found, you can continue the search by
  selecting <EM>Search</EM> <EM>Again</EM> in the <EM>Ops</EM> menu.

  Some other operations on selected entries may be invoked by
  selecting appropriate items in the directory window's <EM>Ops</EM>
  menu.

  Abort in-progress operations by pressing the animated stop
  button in the upper-right corner of the affected directory
  window (this button is normally labeled "LLNL XDIR").  <EM>LLNL</EM>
  <EM>XDIR</EM> will attempt to return control to you at the earliest
  possible moment.

  Configure <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> by selecting the <EM>General</EM> <EM>Preferences</EM>
  item in the <EM>Prefs</EM> menu.


<STRONG>DIRECTORY</STRONG> <STRONG>WINDOW</STRONG> <STRONG>TOOLBAR</STRONG>
  Each directory window has a toolbar that can be used to set
  modes and to invoke operations.  From left to right, the
  toolbar controls are:

  Transfer Mode  (Option menu)
	   The option menu at the left allows you to choose the
	   file transfer mode (<EM>ASCII</EM> or <EM>Binary)</EM>.  This mode is
	   global in scope; hence, changing the value in one
	   directory window will automatically change the value in
	   all directory windows.

  Layout Mode  (Group of four buttons)
	   The layout mode controls how the directory entries are
	   displayed.  The first button selects "Tabular Layout,"
	   in which only the entry names are displayed.  The
	   second button selects "Iconic Layout," in which an icon
	   and name is displayed for each entry.  In Iconic
	   Layout, five different icons are used to identify the
	   entry type: directory, executable file, generic file,
	   socket, and link.  The third button selects "Tree
	   Layout," which is similar to Iconic Layout except that
	   each entry that is a directory also has a small
	   triangle-shaped button, which can be used to expand and
	   collapse the subdirectory.  The last button selects
	   "Full Info Layout," which displays as much information
	   about each directory entry as possible (the amount of
	   information available is limited by the host's FTP
	   server).

  Tunneling Mode  (Button with picture of tunnel)
	   If "tunneling mode" is off, entering a directory that
	   is not already displayed will cause a new window to be
	   created to display that directory.  If tunneling mode
	   is on, an existing directory window (the one from the
	   which the command was invoked) will be used to display
	   a directory that does not already have it own window.

  Dot Files Mode  (Button with dot in dog-eared page)
	   If "dot files mode" is on, then entry names that begin
	   with a dot (i.e., period) will be displayed.

  Cache Mode  (Button with "C")
	   If "cache mode" is on, then directory lists from remote
	   hosts will be saved and used to quickly display
	   revisited directories.

  Refresh Directory  (Button with starburst shape)
	   Redisplay this window's directory.

  Go To Parent  (Up arrow button)
	   Display this window's parent directory.

	   Also, pressing the right mouse button pops up a menu
	   that contains the paths for each ancestor of this
	   window.  Select a path to display that directory.

  Go To Home   (House button)
	   Display the home directory of this directory window's
	   host.

  Delete  (Trash can button)
	   Delete selected directory entries.

  Make Directory  (Button containing folder labeled "New")
	   Create a directory.

  Close  (Skull and cross bones button)
	   Get rid of this directory window.


<STRONG>DIRECTORY</STRONG> <STRONG>WINDOW</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG>
  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> contains a large number of commands that can be
  invoked from the directory windows.  Most commands are
  invoked (1) from the menus, (2) from the toolbars, and (3)
  by dragging and dropping directory entries.  Here is a list
  of the commands:

  About <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> (in <EM>File</EM> menu)
	   Give version information.

  Close (in <EM>File</EM> menu and toolbar)
	   Remove (not iconify) this directory window.  If this
	   directory window is the last for its host, the host is
	   disconnected.

  Connect to Anonymous (in <EM>Connect</EM> menu)
	   Easily connect to an anonymous FTP site.  A dialog pops
	   up to prompt for the remote host, user name and
	   password.  The user name is initialized to "anonymous".
	   The password is initialized to the value of the general
	   preference <EM>Anonymous</EM> <EM>Ftp</EM> <EM>Password</EM> (which you will
	   probably want to set to your email address).  If the
	   general preference <EM>Anonymous</EM> <EM>Ftp</EM> <EM>Password</EM> is blank,
	   <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> will attempt to create a password of the form
	   "user@host".  An optional, space-delimited port number
	   may follow the host name.  Previously used host/user
	   name pairs are saved across sessions, and those with
	   user names "anonymous" or "ftp" are displayed in the
	   scrolled list <EM>Recently</EM> <EM>Referenced</EM> <EM>Hosts</EM>.  Double-
	   clicking on a host/user name pair initiates a
	   connection.  Single-clicking on a host/user name pair
	   places those values into the host name and user name
	   fields, where they can be edited.  Click on the <EM>Connect</EM>
	   button to initiate a connection.  (If already
	   connected, a directory window for that host is simply
	   brought to the front.)  (See general preferences
	   <EM>Anonymous</EM> <EM>Ftp</EM> <EM>Password</EM>, <EM>History</EM> <EM>Sort</EM> <EM>Order</EM>, <EM>Max</EM> <EM>Host</EM>
	   <EM>Name</EM> <EM>History</EM>, and <EM>Max</EM> <EM>User</EM> <EM>Name</EM> <EM>History</EM>.)

  Connect to Local (in <EM>Connect</EM> menu)
	   Connect to the local host (i.e., the host upon which
	   <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> is executing).  If already connected, an
	   existing directory window for the local host is brought
	   to the front.

  Connect to Remote (in <EM>Connect</EM> menu)
	   Connect to a remote host (use <EM>Connect</EM> <EM>to</EM> <EM>Anonymous</EM> to
	   more easily connect to an anonymous FTP site).  A
	   dialog pops up to prompt for the remote host and user
	   names. The user name is initialized to the value of the
	   environment variable <EM>USER</EM>.  An optional, space-
	   delimited port number may follow the host name.
	   Previously used host/user name pairs are saved across
	   sessions, and those with user names other than
	   "anonymous" and "ftp" are displayed in the scrolled
	   list <EM>Recently</EM> <EM>Referenced</EM> <EM>Hosts</EM>.  Double-clicking on a
	   host/user name pair initiates a connection.  Single-
	   clicking on a host/user name pair places those values
	   into the host name and user name fields, where they can
	   be edited.  Click on the <EM>Connect</EM> button to initiate a
	   connection.  (If already connected, a directory window
	   for the host is simply popped to the top.)  (See
	   general preferences <EM>History</EM> <EM>Sort</EM> <EM>Order</EM>, <EM>Max</EM> <EM>Host</EM> <EM>Name</EM>
	   <EM>History</EM>, and <EM>Max</EM> <EM>User</EM> <EM>Name</EM> <EM>History</EM>.)

  Contextual Help (in <EM>Help</EM> menu)
	   Enter contextual-help mode.  The mouse cursor changes
	   to a pointing hand.  Click on any graphical element in
	   the directory window that you wish to know more about.

  Copy (drag-and-drop operation)
	   Copy (i.e., transfer) the selected files according to
	   the mode (ASCII or Binary) specified in the toolbar's
	   file transfer mode option menu.  Copy selected items by
	   using the left mouse button to drag the items.  The
	   drop site of the drag can be (1) the background of
	   another directory window, (2) a directory entry in any
	   directory window (including the source directory
	   window).  Directories, as well as files, can be
	   transferred (but the general preference <EM>Copy</EM> <EM>Mode</EM> must
	   be set to <EM>Recursive)</EM>.  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> does not permit
	   transfers from a remote host to itself.  The desired
	   file transfer mode can be specified via the option menu
	   in the toolbar of any directory window.  Set general
	   preference <EM>Copy</EM> <EM>Mode</EM> to <EM>Recursive</EM> to allow copying of
	   directories.  Set general preference <EM>Overwrite</EM> <EM>Dir</EM> <EM>On</EM>
	   <EM>Copy</EM> to specify whether or not it is okay to overwrite
	   an existing directory.  A dialog pops up to enable the
	   user to monitor the progress of the transfers.  This
	   dialog contains a button for aborting the transfers.
	   (See general preferences <EM>Beep</EM> <EM>When</EM> <EM>Ops</EM> <EM>Done</EM>, <EM>Copy</EM> <EM>Mode</EM>,
	   <EM>Initial</EM> <EM>Transfer</EM> <EM>Mode</EM>, <EM>Inquire</EM> <EM>On</EM> <EM>Copy</EM>, and <EM>Overwrite</EM>
	   <EM>Dir</EM> <EM>On</EM> <EM>Copy</EM>.)

  Delete Selected Entries (in <EM>Ops</EM> menu and toolbar)
	   Delete the selected entries.  Set general preference
	   <EM>Delete</EM> <EM>Mode</EM> to <EM>Recursive</EM> to allow deletion of nonempty
	   directories.  A dialog pops up to enable the user to
	   monitor the progress of the deletions.  This dialog
	   contains a button for aborting the deletions.  (See
	   general preferences <EM>Beep</EM> <EM>When</EM> <EM>Ops</EM> <EM>Done</EM>, <EM>Delete</EM> <EM>Mode</EM> and
	   <EM>Inquire</EM> <EM>On</EM> <EM>Delete</EM>.)

  Deselect All Entries (in <EM>Select</EM> menu)
	   Deselect all the entries in this directory window.

  Deiconify All (in <EM>File</EM> menu)
	   Deiconify all top-level windows in the application.

  Diagnostics (in <EM>Wins</EM> menu)
	   Display the diagnostics window.

  Disconnect (in <EM>Connect</EM> menu)
	   Terminate the connection to this directory window's
	   host.  All directory windows associated with this host
	   are closed.

  Edit History (in <EM>File</EM> menu)
	   Display the Edit History dialog.  See section <EM>Edit</EM>
	   <EM>History</EM> for details.

  Getting Started (in <EM>Help</EM> menu)
	   Learn how to get started using <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM>.

  General Preferences (in <EM>Prefs</EM> menu)

  Go to Ancestor ((in <EM>Goto</EM> menu and toolbar)
	   Display an ancestor of this directory window.

  Go to Directory (in <EM>Goto</EM> menu)
	   Display a directory.  A dialog pops up to prompt for
	   the directory path.  The directory may be specified
	   with a full or relative path.  Previously referenced
	   directories are saved and displayed in a scrollable
	   list.  Double-click on a path in the list to display
	   that directory.  Single click on a path in the list to
	   place that entry into text field <EM>Directory</EM>, where it
	   can be edited.  Click on the <EM>OK</EM> button to change to the
	   directory displayed in the text field.  (See general
	   preferences <EM>History</EM> <EM>Sort</EM> <EM>Order</EM>, <EM>Max</EM> <EM>Dir</EM> <EM>Name</EM> <EM>History</EM>,
	   and <EM>Max</EM> <EM>Host</EM> <EM>Name</EM> <EM>History</EM>.)

  Go to Home Directory (in <EM>Goto</EM> menu and toolbar)
	   Display the home directory of this directory window's
	   host.

  Go to Parent Directory (in <EM>Goto</EM> menu and toolbar)
	   Display the parent directory of this directory window.

  Iconify All (in <EM>File</EM> menu)
	   Iconify all top-level windows in the application.

  Launch (submenu in <EM>Ops</EM> menu and popup menu in entries area)
	   Launch application as a child process.  Select a
	   command name in the <EM>Launch</EM> submenu to fork and exec the
	   associated command.  See section <EM>Launcher</EM> <EM>Preferences</EM>
	   for details on constructing commands.) When a command
	   is launched, placeholders are replaced by their values
	   as follows: "%u" is replaced by the user name, "%h" is
	   replaced by the host name, "%s" is replaced by the name
	   of a selected entry, and "%l" is replaced by the
	   blank-delimited names of all selected entries.  If "%s"
	   is used, then the command is launched once for each
	   selected entry, each time "%s" being replaced by the
	   full path of the next selected entry name.

  Launcher Preferences (in <EM>Prefs</EM> menu)
	   Display the Launcher Preferences window.  See section
	   <EM>Launcher</EM> <EM>Preferences</EM> for details.

  LLNL XDIR Overview (in <EM>Help</EM> menu)
	   Give a high-level description of <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM>.

  Make Directory (in <EM>Ops</EM> menu and toolbar)
	   Pop up a dialog to prompt for the name of a directory
	   to create in the displayed directory.

  Move (drag-and-drop operation)
	   Move selected entries from one directory to another on
	   the same host.  Move selected items by using the left
	   mouse button to drag the items, and holding down the
	   control key when the mouse button is released over the
	   drop site.  (A move differs from a transfer in that (1)
	   the source entries are destroyed, and (2) a move is
	   usually implemented by manipulating file system
	   pointers rather than by actually copying bits.) The
	   drop site of the drag can be (1) the background of
	   another directory window, and (2) a directory entry in
	   any directory window (including the source directory
	   window).  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> only allows moves from a host to
	   itself.  A dialog pops up to enable the user to monitor
	   the progress of the moves.  This dialog contains a
	   button for aborting the move operations.  (See general
	   preferences <EM>Beep</EM> <EM>When</EM> <EM>Ops</EM> <EM>Done</EM>, and <EM>Inquire</EM> <EM>on</EM> <EM>Move</EM>.)

  Quit (in <EM>File</EM> menu)
	   Terminate the application.

  Refresh Directory (in <EM>Ops</EM> menu)
	   Redisplay this window's directory.

  Rename Selected Entries (in <EM>Ops</EM> menu)
	   Pop up a dialog to individually rename selected
	   entries.

  Save Preferences (in <EM>Prefs</EM> menu)
	   Save the current settings of the general, viewer, and
	   launcher preferences.

  Search (in <EM>Ops</EM> menu)
	   Pop up a dialog to initiate a search of directory
	   windows for entry names that match a specified pattern.
	   The pattern to be matched can contain the usual
	   wildcard characters ('*', '?', '[', and ']').  The
	   toggle item <EM>Match</EM> <EM>Case</EM> controls whether case (upper or
	   lower) should be considered when looking for a match.
	   The <EM>Maximum</EM> <EM>Search</EM> <EM>Depth</EM> slider is used to specify the
	   maximum number of directory levels the search command
	   will explore when looking for an entry that matches the
	   specified pattern.  Choose one of the toggle items,
	   <EM>Search</EM> <EM>this</EM> <EM>directory</EM>, <EM>Search</EM> <EM>all</EM> <EM>displayed</EM> <EM>directories</EM>
	   <EM>of</EM> <EM>this</EM> <EM>host</EM>, or <EM>Search</EM> <EM>all</EM> <EM>displayed</EM> <EM>directories</EM> <EM>of</EM>
	   <EM>all</EM> <EM>hosts</EM>, to specify which directory windows (and
	   their descendants) are to be searched.

	   When the <EM>OK</EM> button is pressed, a dialog appears to
	   monitor the progress of the search.  This dialog
	   contains a button that can be used to abort the search.

	   If a match is found in a directory that is already
	   displayed, the entry is selected, scrolled into view,
	   and its directory window is brought to the front.  If a
	   match is found in a directory that is not already
	   displayed, there are two cases: If the search was
	   initiated from a directory window with tunneling mode
	   on, the entry's directory is displayed in that
	   directory window; otherwise a new window is created to
	   display the entry's directory.

	   Use <EM>Search</EM> <EM>Again</EM> to continue the search once an entry
	   has been found.  (See general preferences <EM>Beep</EM> <EM>When</EM> <EM>Ops</EM>
	   <EM>Done</EM>, <EM>Initial</EM> <EM>Max</EM> <EM>Search</EM> <EM>Depth</EM>, <EM>Initial</EM> <EM>Search</EM> <EM>Case</EM>
	   <EM>Match</EM>, and <EM>Initial</EM> <EM>Search</EM> <EM>Range)</EM>.

  Search Again (in <EM>Ops</EM> menu)
	   Search for the next entry that satisfies the search
	   criteria specified by the last search command.  (See
	   general preference <EM>Beep</EM> <EM>When</EM> <EM>Ops</EM> <EM>Done)</EM>.

  Select All Entries (in <EM>Select</EM> menu)
	   Select all the entries in this window.

  Send Quoted Command (in <EM>Ops</EM> menu)
	   Pop up a dialog to prompt for a "raw" command to send
	   to the FTP server of the remote host.  Previously
	   issued commands are saved and displayed in a scrolled
	   list.  Double-clicking on a command in the list issues
	   that command.  To have a command act on selected
	   entries, use the quote placeholder ("%s") to represent
	   a selected item.  For example, type "stage 1 %s" to
	   send a STAGE command to the the remote host for each
	   selected entry.  (See general preference <EM>Beep</EM> <EM>When</EM> <EM>Ops</EM>
	   <EM>Done</EM> and <EM>Max</EM> <EM>Quoted</EM> <EM>Cmd</EM> <EM>History</EM>.)

  Use Wildcard (in <EM>Select</EM> menu)
	   Pop up a dialog to prompt for a wildcard expression to
	   use in selecting entries in this directory window.
	   Previously referenced wildcard expressions are saved
	   and displayed in a scrolled list.  Double-clicking on
	   an item in the list applies that wildcard expression.
	   Single-clicking on an item in the list places the
	   expression in a text field where it may be edited.
	   Choose the toggle item <EM>Replace</EM> <EM>Selection</EM> to cause the
	   currently selected entries to be cleared before
	   applying the wildcard.  Choose the toggle item <EM>Add</EM> <EM>to</EM>
	   <EM>Selection</EM> to cause the entries selected by the wildcard
	   to be added to the current selection.  (See general
	   preference <EM>Initial</EM> <EM>Wildcard</EM> <EM>Mode</EM> and <EM>Max</EM> <EM>Wildcard</EM>
	   <EM>History)</EM>.

  Using Help (in <EM>Help</EM> menu)
	   Describe the online help package.

  View Selected Files (in <EM>Ops</EM> menu)
	   Display the selected files.  The viewer preferences
	   dialog (accessible via the <EM>Prefs</EM> menu) can be used to
	   control whether files will be displayed using the
	   built-in viewer or using an external viewer of the
	   user's choice (e.g., <EM>emacs</EM> or <EM>xv)</EM>.  The selection of
	   the viewer is configurable, based on the file extension
	   (e.g., ".gif" or ".jpg").

	   The file is transferred according to the mode (ASCII or
	   Binary) specified in the toolbar of the directory
	   window.  A dialog pops up to enable the user to monitor
	   the progress of the transfer.  This dialog contains a
	   button for aborting the transfer.

	   The destination of the transfer is a temporary
	   directory created in the directory defined as <EM>P_tmpdir</EM>
	   in the include file "/usr/include/stdio.h".  If the
	   environment variable <EM>TMPDIR</EM> is defined, it is used as
	   the directory.  The temporary directory, and the files
	   it contains, are automatically deleted when the user
	   dismisses the viewer or terminates <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM>.

	   If the file is recognized as being compressed, it is
	   expanded before viewing.  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> excutes the
	   following decompressors based on the file extension:
	   <EM>gunzip</EM> for ".z" and ".gz"; <EM>uncompress</EM> for ".Z"; <EM>atob</EM>
	   for "atob"; and <EM>uudecode</EM> for ".uu".  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> searches
	   for the decompressor application in the standard way
	   using the <EM>PATH</EM> environment variable.

  Viewer Preferences (in <EM>Prefs</EM> menus)
	   Display the viewer preferences window.  See section
	   <EM>Viewer</EM> <EM>Preferences</EM> for details.


<STRONG>GENERAL</STRONG> <STRONG>PREFERENCES</STRONG>
  Selecting item <EM>General</EM> <EM>Preferences</EM> in a directory window's

	   The default file transfer mode (<EM>ASCII</EM> or <EM>Binary)</EM>.

  Initial Tunneling Mode
	   Specifies tunneling mode for the first created
	   directory window.  Tunneling mode controls whether or
	   not a new directory window is created to display a
	   directory.  Each subsequently created directory window
	   inherits its tunneling mode from its parent directory
	   window.

  Initial Wildcard Mode
	   The default mode of the Use Wildcard dialog.  Choose
	   <EM>Replace</EM> to make <EM>Replace</EM> <EM>Selection</EM> the default.  Choose
	   <EM>Add</EM> to make <EM>Add</EM> <EM>to</EM> <EM>Selection</EM> the default.

  Overwrite Dir On Copy
	   Specifies whether it is okay to overwrite an existing
	   directory when recursively copying another directory by
	   the same name.  If a sink directory is overwritten then
	   none of its subdirectories will be deleted, but new
	   files and subdirectories might be added to it, and some
	   existing files might be replaced.

  Preserve Vms Ver Nums
	   Specifies whether to preserve VMS file version numbers
	   when transferring files from a VMS system.  This is
	   only an issue for those VMS FTP servers that provide
	   version numbers (at least one server does not).

  Print Password In Debug
	   Specifies whether to print passwords in the diagnostics
	   window when the level of diagnostics messages is set to
	   <EM>Debug</EM>.

  Stop Button Blinking
	   Specifies whether the STOP button (shown during
	   potentially lengthy operations) should blink or not.

  Store Unique
	   Specifies whether existing sink files are to be renamed
	   before file transfer occurs.  If <EM>Yes</EM> then the existing
	   sink file is typically renamed by appending a "."
	   (period) followed by an integer between 1 and 99.

  Type To Select Delay
	   The number of milliseconds to wait before <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM>
	   determines that you are finished typing characters into
	   a directory window to select the first entry that best

  Use Last Dir At Login
	   Specifies whether to automatically enter the most
	   recently referenced directory after connecting to a
	   host.  If this option is requested, but is not possible
	   to perform (e.g., because the directory no longer
	   exists), your home directory will be entered.


<STRONG>VIEWER</STRONG> <STRONG>PREFERENCES</STRONG>
  Selecting item <EM>Viewer</EM> <EM>Preferences</EM> in a directory window's
  <EM>Prefs</EM> menu pops up a dialog that allows the user to control
  which file will be displayed with which viewer, based on the
  file extension.

  A file to be viewed is first transferred to a temporary
  directory and then, if necessary, is decompressed.  The file
  extension (e.g., ".gif") is then examined to determine which
  viewer the file is to be displayed in.  There are two types
  of viewers: the viewer built into <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> (which is
  suitable for displaying text files) and external viewers
  (e.g., <EM>emacs</EM> for text and <EM>xv</EM> for graphics).

  Single-click on an entry in the <EM>Extensions</EM> list to place
  that extension and its associated command line into the
  <EM>Extension</EM> and <EM>Viewer</EM> <EM>Command</EM> <EM>Line</EM> text fields, respectively.

  An extension is a file suffix that begins with a period
  (".").  A special entry in the extensions list, "OTHERS,"
  represents all files that do not have their extension listed
  (including files with no extensions).

  The pattern "%s" in a command line is a placeholder for the
  name of the file to be viewed.  A blank command line
  indicates that the built-in viewer is to be used.  To add a
  new extension to the list, fill in the <EM>Extension</EM> and <EM>Viewer</EM>
  <EM>Command</EM> <EM>Line</EM> text fields and press the <EM>Add</EM> button.  If the
  text in <EM>Extension</EM> does not begin with a period, one will be
  added.  If the extension is already in the list, it will be
  replaced.

  To replace the command line associated with an extension,
  (1) single-click on the list item to select it, (2) edit the
  command line, and (3) press the <EM>Replace</EM> button.

  To delete an extension from the list, single-click on the
  list item to select it and then press the <EM>Delete</EM> button.
  The "OTHERS" entry cannot be deleted (but its command line
  can be replaced).

  Click the <EM>Apply</EM> button to cause the new changes to take
  effect.  The <EM>OK</EM> button has the same effect as <EM>Apply</EM>, but the
  dialog is also closed.  The <EM>Cancel</EM> button undoes the changes
  made since <EM>OK</EM> or <EM>Apply</EM> were last pressed.

  The viewer preferences can be preserved across <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM>
  sessions in a text file named ".xdirrc" in the user's home
  directory (select <EM>Save</EM> <EM>Preferences</EM> in a directory window's
  <EM>Prefs</EM> menu).


<STRONG>LAUNCHER</STRONG> <STRONG>PREFERENCES</STRONG>
  Selecting item <EM>Launcher</EM> <EM>Preferences</EM> in a directory window's
  <EM>Prefs</EM> menu pops up a dialog that allows the user to specify
  commands that can be invoked using the <EM>Launch</EM> submenu of the
  <EM>Ops</EM> menu.  The idea is to be able to fork and exec child
  processes with execute lines based on information about
  selected entries.

  Single-click on an entry in the <EM>Command</EM> <EM>Names</EM> list to place
  that command name and its associated command line into the
  <EM>Command</EM> <EM>Name</EM> and <EM>Command</EM> <EM>Line</EM> text fields, respectively.

  The following placeholders can be specified in a command
  line: "%u" for the user name, "%h" for the host name, "%s"
  for the name of a selected entry, and "%l" for the blank-
  delimited names of all selected entries.  To add a new
  command to the list, fill in the <EM>Command</EM> <EM>Name</EM> and <EM>Command</EM>
  <EM>Line</EM> text fields and press the <EM>Add</EM> button.  If the command
  name is already in the list, it will be replaced.

  To replace the command line associated with a command name,
  (1) single-click on the list item to select it, (2) edit the
  command line, and (3) press the <EM>Replace</EM> button.

  To delete a command from the list, single-click on the list
  item to select it and then press the <EM>Delete</EM> button.

  Click the <EM>Apply</EM> button to cause the new changes to take
  effect.  The <EM>OK</EM> button has the same effect as <EM>Apply</EM>, but the
  dialog is also closed.  The <EM>Cancel</EM> button undoes the changes
  made since <EM>OK</EM> or <EM>Apply</EM> were last pressed.

  The launcher preferences can be preserved across <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM>
  sessions in a text file named ".xdirrc" in the user's home
  directory (select <EM>Save</EM> <EM>Preferences</EM> in a directory window's
  <EM>Prefs</EM> menu).

  The names of the commands will be placed in the <EM>Launch</EM>
  submenu of the <EM>Ops</EM> menu.  (See command <EM>Launch</EM> in section
  <EM>Directory</EM> <EM>Window</EM> <EM>Commands</EM> for details on how commands are
  actually launched.)


<STRONG>EDIT</STRONG> <STRONG>HISTORY</STRONG>
  Selecting item <EM>Edit</EM> <EM>History</EM> in a directory window's <EM>File</EM>
  menu pops up a dialog that allows the user to remove
  unwanted history information.  (<EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> automatically
  saves certain information, such as the paths of previously
  visited directories, for future use.)

  Four categories of history information are saved for each
  host: (1) paths of previously visited directories, (2)
  wildcard expressions used in selecting directory entries,
  (3) user names used in connecting to the host, and (4) low-
  level "quoted" commands sent to the host's FTP server.

  An entire host's history information may be removed by
  selecting an entry in the <EM>Hosts</EM> list and then clicking the
  <EM>Delete</EM> <EM>Host</EM> button.

  A single item may be removed by using the three lists to
  specify host, category and item, and then clicking the
  <EM>Delete</EM> <EM>Item</EM> button.

  Click the <EM>OK</EM> button to cause the changes to take effect (and
  remove the dialog).  Click the <EM>Cancel</EM> button to undo the
  changes (and remove the dialog).



<STRONG>LIMITATIONS</STRONG>
  Here are some things to watch out for:

  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> might not work with some old X servers.  For
  example, some older OpenWindows servers might dump core.
  MacX fans should use nothing older than version 1.1.7b.

  Old, buggy versions of Motif can cause weirdness.

  <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> might not work correctly with some non-Unix FTP
  servers.  (If you can give us temporary access to such a
  server, we might be able to fix the problem.)

  Out-of-spec FTP servers can cause untold grief.  (Most
  Unix-based servers work correctly.)

  Third-party file transfers will not work unless at least one
  of the remote FTP servers supports the PASV (passive)
  command.


<STRONG>FILES</STRONG>
  $HOME/.xdirhistory   history file
  $HOME/.xdirrc        preferences
  XDir                 application defaults file


<STRONG>AVAILABILITY</STRONG>
  Source code for <EM>LLNL</EM> <EM>XDIR</EM> is tarred and compressed, and is
