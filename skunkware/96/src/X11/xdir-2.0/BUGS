Email bug reports to llnlxdir@llnl.gov.  Please report compiler-generated
warning errors as well as run-time errors.  In addition to the particulars
of the problem, please specify:

  o  LLNL XDIR version number

  o  System (e.g., SGI IRIX 4.0.5)

  o  Compiler (e.g., gcc) and options

  o  Versions of Motif and X11

                           *   Known Bugs   *
                           ******************

  o  LLNL XDIR chokes on Apollo path names that begin with "//".

  o  LLNL XDIR terminates abnormally when displaying a long list on from
     the anonymous FTP site server.berkeley.edu because of the unusual
     format returned by that server.  (A workaround is for you to put a
     '-' character at the beginning of your password since this forces
     the server to return a standard format.)

  o  STOP button has no effect during connections to remote hosts made
     with SOCKSified executable.

  o  On Linux systems, Xdir binaries built with Motif 2.0 can die with a
     segmentation fault when closing a directory window.  This does not
     occur on all Linux systems using Motif 2.0, and is apparently due to
     a Motif bug.  One of the vendors that supplies Motif for Linux systems
     has reported the bug to OSF.  Until the bug is fixed, the only work-
     around I know of is to replace the following line in dirwin3.c,

             XtDestroyWidget(dirwin->w_shell);
     with
             XtUnrealizeWidget(dirwin->w_shell);

     This will cause the directory window to disappear upon closing and
     will free resources on the X server, but will not free widget data
     structures in the Xdir client (hence, the executable will act as though
     it has a bad memory leak).

  o  On Solaris 2.4 systems, Xdir binaries built with Motif libraries that
     were not supplied by Sun Microsystems have been known to die during
     certain operations in the function _XmIEndUpdate().  The segmentation
     fault seems to be due to a Motif bug, but this has not been confirmed.
     The problem has not been observed with binaries built with the Motif
     supplied by Sun Microsystems.
