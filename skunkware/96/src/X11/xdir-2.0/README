    **************************  ABOUT LLNL XDIR  *************************
    **********************************************************************

    LLNL XDIR, an OSF/Motif-based FTP client, provides a graphical user
    interface for drag-and-drop file transfer.  LLNL XDIR simultaneously
    displays any number of directories for any number of hosts, with each
    directory being displayed in its own window.  LLNL XDIR supports
    powerful directory browsing capability, including iconic and
    hierarchical views.  One of LLNL XDIR's most powerful features is its
    ability to search directory structures (even across multiple hosts)
    for entry names that match a specified pattern.

    LLNL XDIR is meant to be the successor to LLNL XFTP, another graphical
    FTP client.  LLNL XDIR is considerably more sophisticated than LLNL
    XFTP, and has all of its functionality.

    LLNL XDIR is a component of the Intelligent Archive, which is currently
    under development at LLNL.

    LLNL XDIR was written by Neale Smith of the Lawrence Livermore National
    Laboratory, which is operated by the University of California.

    ************************  BUILDING LLNL XDIR  ************************
    **********************************************************************

    LLNL XDIR requires OSF/Motif 1.2 or later (earlier versions of Motif
    might work okay, but don't bother with anything earlier than 1.1.4).

    One version or another of LLNL XDIR has been successfully built on the
    following platforms (and a bunch of others):

          Computer            System                         Motif
          --------            ------                         -----

          Convex              Convex OS 10.1                 1.?
          i486-66             Sunsoft Interactive Unix 4.0   ?
          i486/33             BSD/OS 1.1                     1.2.3
          Intel               UnixWare 2.02                  1.2.3
          i486/33             Linux 1.2.13                   2.0.0

    Perform the following steps to build LLNL XDIR:

    1. Enter the "sources" directory and type "xmkmf" to create "Makefile"
       from "Imakefile".  If you are unable to get this to work, use the
       backup makefile, "Makefile.alt", by uncommenting (and possibly
       editing) the section which seems most promising for your platform.

       NOTE: Follow instructions at beginning of Imakefile or Makefile.alt
             if you wish to build a SOCKSified executable.

       NOTE: To avoid a problem with Imake templates on Solaris 2.4, you
             might try executing the following (insteading of using xmkmf)
             to generate your Makefile:

                   imake -I/usr/openwin/lib/config -DHAVE_USR_DT

    2. Type "make" to build the executable "xdir".

    3. Type "make install" to install the executable and the application
       defaults file.

    4. Type "make install.man" to install the man page.


    **********************************************************************
    ********************  Application Defaults File  *********************
    **********************************************************************

    It is usually not necessary to use an application defaults file with
    LLNL XDIR (since LLNL XDIR contains built-in fallback values).  You may
    wish to use an application defaults file with LLNL XDIR if you want to
    customize certain widget attributes such as fonts or colors.

    The application defaults file is named "XDir".  (A symbolic link to
    XDir is in the "sources" subdirectory.)  Make sure that XDir is in
    the search path of one of the X application defaults file environment
    variables (e.g., XAPPLRESDIR, XFILESEARCHPATH, or XUSERFILESEARCHPATH).
    Consult the usual X documentation on how to set and use these environment
    variables.

    NOTE: LLNL XDIR 2.0 is not compatible with the earlier versions of the
    app defaults file.  One sure sign that an old XDir is being picked up
    is that the file transfer monitor (the dialog that appears during file
    transfers) will look funny.


    **********************************************************************
    ***************************  Limitations  ****************************
    **********************************************************************
    
    Here are some things to watch out for:

      (1) LLNL XDIR might not work with some old X servers.  For example,
          some older OpenWindows servers might dump core.  MacX fans should
          use nothing older than version 1.1.7b.

      (2) Old, buggy versions of Motif can cause weirdness.

      (3) LLNL XDIR might not work correctly with some non-Unix FTP servers
          (If you can give us temporary access to such a server, we might
          be able to fix the problem.)

      (4) Out-of-spec FTP servers can cause untold grief.  (Most Unix-based
          servers work correctly.)

      (5) Third-party file transfers will not work unless at least one of
          the remote FTP servers supports the PASV (passive) command.
