Apr 12 92   Ramon Santiago           santiago@fgssu1.sinet.slb.com

	    + Added code to support icon menu of actions.
	    + Added code to internally provide a pseudo-terminal to a
	      process (not using an xterm inside the action command).

	      order.
	    + Changed config file syntax for command description ('%s'
	      replaces '!@', to remain consistent with icon actions
	      description which allows '%f', '%n', '%b', '%e' and '%d').

	    + Fix bug in SendInput when just hitting CR or clicking Input.

	    icon_list[index]->user_data  is null (no preference at all).
	    + Fix bug in button_selected when mode is Long (freeing
	    unallocated memory).
	    + Change signature of do_iconprefs and applyprefs to
	    return a pointer into the type preference instead of
	    allocating a user preference, which could sometimes results
	    in memory leaks or memory errors.

Feb 04 93   Lionel Mallet
	    + Fix bug with freeing filetype->filename before used in
	    duplicateQueryReturn callback which caused Duplicate File
	    to either fail or copy irrelevant file or even crash(?).

Feb 09 93   Lionel Mallet
	    + Bug fixed: when moving a directory, the moved directory
	    was not deleted (the command used was rm -f instead of rm -rf). 
	    + Bug fixed: when copying files, the modification time of
	    newly created files was not updated (fixed using m option
	    of tar).

Feb 12 93   Lionel Mallet
	    + Bug fixed: two calls to XtVa* functions without the NULL
	    terminating arg (side-effect on Trash/Move/Copy functions
	    when calling destroy_button_dialog).

Feb 15 93   Lionel Mallet
	    + Bug fixed: Duplicate File on a directory add one level
	    of directory (i.e., temp -> temp2 = temp2/temp).
	    duplicateQueryReturn changed to only do a cp -r.

Mar 9 93    Lionel Mallet
	    + Bug fixed: Duplicate File incorrectly deals with
	    symbolic links. Changed cp -r to avoid this. Rather use
	    this principle:
	    	        .
		        |
		 ----------------
		 |	  |	 |
		foo    mangled  bar
		   \      |     ^
		  1 ---> foo --/ 2

Mar 10 93  Lionel Mallet
	   + Bug fixed: moveQueryResult and copyQueryResult were
	   reallocating unsufficient space. Confusion between rmstring
	   and movestring when reallocating rmstring was causing Move
	   to crash when moving a lot of files.

Mar 29 93  Lionel Mallet
	   + Bug fixed: Map and Select help windows were frozen due to
	   a Non exclusive grab of the Map and Select dialog taking
	   effect over the Help None grab.

Mar 29 93  **** Released xdtm 2.4.8

Apr 28 93  Lionel Mallet
	   + Bug fixed: SelectAll when . or .. are ignored was
	   crashing due to Unhighlighting inexistant item.

Apr 29 93  Lionel Mallet
	   + Bug fixed: union wait was used instead of int on SYSV
	   machines (like HP).
	   + Bug fixed: dialog title of Trash/Move/Copy dialog was
	   always "Delete Files".
	   + Enhancement: TermWindow are now considered as
	   topLevelShell windows instead of transientShell ones. They
	   can live without Xdtm main window so...
	   + Portability: some machines don't have B option of tar as
	   Sun's do, toggling it off.
	   + Bug fixed: now use different messages when copy fails or
	   rm fails during a Move.

May 17 93  Lionel Mallet
	   + Bug fixed: Allocating insufficient memory when changing
	   directory from "Goto" line to determine directory name.

Jun 2 93   Lionel Mallet
	   + Portability issue: setlinebuf seems to be a BSD function,
	   on SYSV use setvbuf instead (appman.c).
	   + Typo: in iconman.c, AppProgram was written ApProgram in
	   prototype.
	   + Bug fixed: when updating file information in Info dialog,
	   a / is added at the end of the current directory (menus.c,
	   doubleclick.c, dirman.c).

Jun 3 93   Lionel Mallet
	   + Bug fixed: buttons remained sensitive when Copy/Move was
	   cancelled. 
	   + Enhancement: bell ringing totally revisited. Bell is rung
	   inside alert_dialog when resource BellOnWarn is True. Bell
	   is rung in child_died when resource BellOnExit is True.

Jun 4 93  **** Released xdtm 2.4.9

Jun 9 93   Lionel Mallet
	   + Bug fixed: reverting a bug introduced in previous version
	   in button_selected() causing Trash/Move/Copy to fail in
	   Long mode.

Jun 10 93  Lionel Mallet
	   + Bug fixed: icon menus no longer grab the server
	   incorrectly causing server lock when a window gets mapped
	   over an opened icon menu. The grab is put on the directory
	   manager to get all button events when an icon menu is
	   displayed.
	   + Add: realize_dialog signature changed to pass a handler
	   and client data to call on WM_DELETE_WINDOW. Default
	   behaviour (if no handler passed) is to ignore the event.
	   + Bug fixed: WIFEXITED and WEXITSTATUS need not be defined
	   on HP architecture (appman.c).
	   + Portability: Dec need not including <sys/unistd.h>.
	   + Add: Handlers for WM_DELETE_WINDOW on all dialogs but
	   alert ones. Action executed is always safe.
	   + Bug fixed: when no program selected in map dialog or icon
	   program empty, xdtm crashes with SEGV on execution of such actions.
	   +Bug fixed: realize_dialog() could map window out of
	   screen. Still some problems with WM borders.

Jun 16 93  Lionel Mallet
	   + Bug fixed: xdtm used to exit when help files were not found.

Jun 22 93  **** Released xdtm 2.4.10

Jun 25 93  Lionel Mallet
	   + Bug fixed: refresh_proclist() was using same var for real
	   number of processes and widget's number of processes.
	   File->List Processes button was incorrectly activated and
	   xdtm could crash when redisplaying process list in widget.
	   + Problem fixed: Mike Hoswell (hoswell@ra.cgd.ucar.EDU)
	   reported that when running on a Sparc10, Xdtm was crashing
	   on getting the translation table of process list widget.
	   All translation table manipulations are removed, they are
	   now useless. 
	   + Portability: fixed include file needed for access(). Use
	   unistd.h for all architectures (hope it's right!). Files
	   concerned are doubleclick.c, menus.c, map.c.
	   + Added set_cmd_is_first definition without prototype in parser.y.
	   + Bug fixed: arguments check in appman.c:build_arguments()
	   was reporting error in ASEL mode when no file is selected
	   (Thx to Pat Dohoney - dohoney@sirius.llnl.gov).

Aug 25 93 Lionel Mallet

	   process, it is now fixed.
	   + name of alert dialog widget changed to alertDialog to
	   make setting title through resource possible (added in
	   Xdtm.ad.tmpl).
	   + Add new application resource SilentSelection to allow
	   program to silently start if possible even if selection
	   list size does not match required one. Access to this
	   resource is provided in the Options menu.
	   + Fixed reverse video icons on display with black pixel = 0
