<STRONG>NAME</STRONG>
  xdtm - graphical shell for X

<STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>
  xdtm [ -<EM>cf</EM> configuration_file ] [ -<EM>delay</EM> time ] [ -<EM>dmfont</EM>
  font_name ] [ standard X options ]

<STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
  The X Desktop Manager is a graphical shell for the X Window
  System.  It provides facilities to list directories
  graphically, view, edit, copy, move, delete, and modify
  permissions on files, and to launch programs.

  It comes with comprehensive help available from within the
  program, this should be consulted for instructions on how to
  use the program.

  The -<EM>cf</EM> option tells xdtm to use the following file as the
  configuration file. If this file is not found xdtm will try
  the users home directory for the file .xdtmrc, if that fails
  the system xdtmrc will be used.

  The -<EM>delay</EM> option is used on systems with NFS mounted
  directories.  It specifies the time in seconds to delay
  between updating a directories contents and updating the
  directory listing within xdtm. A value of 1 second is
  usually enough unless the network is very heavily loaded.
  The valid range is between 1 and 5 seconds.

  The -<EM>dmfont</EM> option is used to specify the font to be used to
  list the filenames in the directory list. Because this font
  is used in the long listing mode within which spaces are
  used to align the columns of data a fixed width font should
  be specified.

  Any standard X Toolkit command line options may be used in
  addition to the ones already listed above.

<STRONG>DIAGNOSTICS</STRONG>
  Xdtm will display any standard error output from the
  commands it executes. It will also complain about any errors
  in accessing files.

<STRONG>FILES</STRONG>
