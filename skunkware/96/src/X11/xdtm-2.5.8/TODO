- add the tree manager based on the Athena R5 tree widget. This is 
  easy and I have already done so on a separate code line.

- add the ability to produce a sound when opening up a file or
  spawning a process. I don't know how to do this.

- add a Motif version including the drag and drop from Motif 1.2.
  This will probably be in part on the next release.

- replace Help System with a HyperText based widget Help System,
  somebody has already posted a simple HyperText widget to export
  I will probably use that.
