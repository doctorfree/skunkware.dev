     The X Desktop Manager is a graphical shell for the X Window System, 
     it provides mechanisms for all the usual shell activities and is 
     intended to reduce the training necessary for UNIX novice to become
     productive on your system.

     System requirements: An ANSI compliant C compiler, ideally 'gcc'
                          The X Window system release 4 or 5 libraries.
                          The Athena widget set (header files + library)
                          lex (or flex) and yacc (or bison)
                          a smile on your face :-)

     Installation instructions: 

     1) Unpack the shar archives in order, the archives unpack into the 
        current directory.

     2) If you have 'imake(1)' edit the Imakefile for your system, 
        otherwise edit the Imakefile.Old files in the main source
        directory and the Xedw and regexp directories using the 
        Imakefile as a guide.

     3) If you have 'imake(1)' execute the command 'xmkmf' to make the
        Makefile, followed by 'make Makefiles'.
        If you DO NOT have imake then copy the Makefile.Old to Makefile
        in the main source directory AND the Xedw and regexp directories.

     4) execute 'make all' to make xdtm.

     5) execute 'make install install.man' to install xdtm and the xdtm
        manual page.
