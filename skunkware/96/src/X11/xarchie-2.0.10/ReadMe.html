  xarchie - X11 browser interface to archie, version 2.0.9

<STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>
  xarchie [X Toolkit options] [-host host]
		  [-search type|-e|-c|-s|-r|-ec|-es|-er]
		  [-sort type|-t|-w] [-maxhits num] [-offset num]
		  [-nice lev|-N lev] [-noscroll] [-mono|-gray|-color]
		  [-debug num|-D num] [-help|-?]

<STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
  Xarchie is an X11 browser interface to the  Archie  Internet
  information  system  using  the  Prospero virtual filesystem
  protocol.  Archie provides information about files available
  for  ftp  anywhere  on  the  Internet; Xarchie displays this
  information using an easy-to-use, point-and-click interface.
  Xarchie allows you to further explore ftp sites by examining
  directories returned as query matches,  and  allows  you  to
  retrieve  files located this way.  Xarchie is designed (like
  most X applications) to be highly customizable, allowing you
  to  tailor  the  look-and-feel  of  the  tool  to  your  own
  preferences.

  This document is broken into two parts.  First,  the  USER'S
  GUIDE  describes  Archie  and Xarchie, and covers both Basic
  and Advanced Xarchie usage.  Second,  the  REFERENCE  MANUAL
  provides  all  the  information needed to customize Xarchie.
  You can also browse this document  using  the  Xarchie  Help
  facility.

  To  report  problems  or  bugs,  please  see   the   section
  "Reporting Bugs" in the REFERENCE MANUAL section.

<STRONG>USER'S</STRONG> <STRONG>GUIDE</STRONG>
  The User's Guide section of this manual describes the Archie
  service,  the  Xarchie  client,  and  how  to use Xarchie to
  access resources available for FTP on the Internet.

<STRONG>What</STRONG> <STRONG>is</STRONG> <STRONG>Archie?</STRONG>
  The Archie information system is a network-based information
  tool  offering  proactive  data  retrieval  and indexing for
  widely distributed collections of data.

  Perhaps the best known application of the Archie  system  is
  to  maintain  the Internet Archives database. This database,
  already available from a number of service providers  across
  the Internet, currently contains the names of over 2,100,000
  files at over 1,000 anonymous FTP archive sites.  Using this
  database,  users can rapidly locate needed files without the
  need to log onto dozens or even hundreds of machines. Archie
  servers offering this database currently receive over 50,000
  queries per day.  It  is  this  database  that  the  Xarchie
  client accesses, as described in the next section, using one
  of the many independently owned and operated Archie  servers
  around the world.

  The Archie system is much more than  the  Internet  Archives
  database.   For  more information contact Bunyip Information
  Systems  at  (514)  398-3709  or  (514)  398-811  or   email
  "info@bunyip.com".

<STRONG>What</STRONG> <STRONG>is</STRONG> <STRONG>Xarchie?</STRONG>
  Xarchie is an X11 browser interface to the  Archie  Internet
  Archives  database  using  the  Prospero  virtual filesystem
  protocol.  Archie provides information about files available
  for  ftp  anywhere  on  the  Internet; Xarchie displays this
  information using an easy-to-use, point-and-click interface.
  Xarchie allows you to further explore ftp sites by examining
  directories returned as query matches,  and  allows  you  to
  retrieve files located this way.

  Xarchie is designed (like most X applications) to be  highly
  customizable,  allowing  you  to tailor the look-and-feel of
  the tool to your own preferences. See the  REFERENCE  MANUAL
  for details.

  Users should be aware that the  Xarchie  client  accesses  a
  server  that  is shared with users on other hosts.  As such,
  submitting long or large  numbers  of  queries  during  peak
  periods  not  only  increases the time that you have to wait
  for a response, but it increases the time that  others  have
  to  wait  too.  Please  read  about  the  -<EM>nice</EM>  option, the
  <STRONG>niceLevel</STRONG> resource, and  the  "Nice  Level"  setting  before
  making  large  queries.   Also,  you  should use the closest
  possible host to save long-distance network traffic. Abusers
  of the service may find their access revoked without notice.

<STRONG>The</STRONG> <STRONG>Xarchie</STRONG> <STRONG>Display</STRONG>
  Xarchie uses several conventions regarding menus and  button
  names:

  -    Clicking on a button whose name ends with  a  "&gt;"  will
	   pop  up a menu from which you should select the desired
	   action.

  -    Clicking on or selecting an item  whose  name  ends  in
	   "..." will pop up a panel that will let you perform the
	   desired operation.

  A label with neither of these suffixes  indicates  that  the
  action will be taken without subsequent interaction.

  Xarchie's display is divided into  three  horizontal  areas.
  The  top  pane  is  a  control panel providing the following
  buttons:

  File:
	   Clicking on this button presents the  File  Menu,  from
	   which   you   can  select  a  variety  of  file-related
	   operations  to  be  described  later.  The  File   Menu
	   operations can also be invoked by holding down the Meta
	   key and typing the first letter of the operation's name
	   (e.g., Meta-Q to quit).

  Settings:
	   Clicking on this button  presents  the  Settings  Menu,
	   whose  operations  will  be  described in the "Advanced
	   Usage" section.

  Query:
	   This button presents  the  Query  Menu,  used  to  send
	   queries  to  Archie.   Its  operation will be described
	   shortly.

  Abort:
	   When active during a query or  retrieval,  this  button
	   allows you to abort the operation.

  Help:
	   Clicking on this button pops up the Help  Panel,  which
	   allows you to browse this document on-line.

  Finally, the area  labelled  "Status"  is  used  to  provide
  information   about   the  progress  of  a  query  or  other
  informative messages.

  The middle pane of the Xarchie display functions as a  host-
  location-file  browser.  That is, the leftmost pane displays
  hostnames, the middle pane locations (directories), and  the
  rightmost pane files or directories returned by a query. The
  browser's use is described in the section "Browsing", below.
  You  can adjust the relative size of the browser panes using
  the Grips on their borders.

  Finally, the bottom pane of the Xarchie display  provides  a
  set  of Text items where you can enter information and where
  information is displayed as query results are  browsed.  Not
  all  Text  items  can be typed in; some are used for display
  only. These text items provide Emacs-like  editing  controls
  (see  <EM>xedit</EM>(1) for a complete description). Typing Return in
  some  Text  items  invokes  an  action  as  a  shortcut  for
  selecting it from a menu or button.

<STRONG>Basic</STRONG> <STRONG>Xarchie</STRONG> <STRONG>Usage</STRONG>
  This  section  provides  information  on   basic   querying,
  browsing,  and file operations. The "Advanced Xarchie Usage"
  section describes how to use the Settings Panel and  how  to
  perform other, more complicated, queries.

<STRONG>Querying</STRONG>
  The primary function provided by Xarchie is that of querying
  the  Archie  server  for  a  "search  term"  (the  string or
  expression for which you want to search). By  default,  your
  query  uses <EM>exact</EM> search mode. That is, the search term must
  literally match an entry in the database for the entry to be
  returned.   Other   search  modes  are  available,  and  are
  described in the "Advanced Usage" section.

  You enter your search term  in  the  appropriately  labelled
  Text  item  in  the  bottom  pane  of  the  Xarchie display.
  Hitting Return in the text item or  selecting  "Query  Item"
  from the Query Menu will send your request to Archie.

  The Status area will be updated  as  the  query  progresses.
  First  the  Archie  server's  Internet address is looked up,
  then the server is contacted, the search term is sent  over,
  and, after reaching the front of the server's request queue,
  matches are returned to Xarchie. The matches,  if  any,  are
  displayed  in  the browser and the Status area indicates how
  many matches were returned.

  If your window manager and version of X support it, you  can
  iconify  the Xarchie application and the icon will change to
  reflect the progress of your query. That is, it will  change
  when a query is in progress and when it finishes.

<STRONG>Aborting</STRONG>
  If you find that your query is  taking  too  long,  you  can
  abort  it  by  clicking  on  the  "Abort"  button when it is
  active. Your query will be aborted as soon as possible.  You
  should  note  that  while aborting a query will allow you to
  enter a new query, it does not remove  the  query  from  the
  server's  queue  (this  may be changed in the future).  Thus
  aborting queries does not reduce the load on the  server  --
  just the opposite probably. Use it with discretion, like the
  rest of the service.

<STRONG>Browsing</STRONG>
  As described in  the  section  "The  Xarchie  Display",  the
  middle  pane  of  the  Xarchie  display functions as a host-
  location-file browser.  The leftmost  pane  of  the  browser
  contains  the  names of hosts that have a file matching your
  search term. Clicking the Left mouse button  on  a  hostname
  will  highlight  it  and cause the middle browser pane to be
  filled with a list of locations on  that  host  where  files
  matching  your  search  term  can  be  found.  The  selected
  hostname will also be displayed in the  Text  item  labelled
  "Host" in the bottom pane of the Xarchie display.
  Similarly, selecting a location from the middle browser pane
  will  cause  the right browser pane to be filled with a list
  of the  files  available  from  the  selected  host  in  the
  selected location, and the location will be displayed in the
  bottom pane item labelled "Location".

  Finally, selecting a file from the right browser pane causes
  its  name, size, permission modes and last-modification date
  to be displayed in the correspondingly-labelled bottom  pane
  items.

  Note that if a browser pane has only  one  item,  then  that
  item  will  be automatically selected and its "lesser" panes
  and information items filled in. This saves time and  effort
  in  the  common case where there is only one host, location,
  or file  that  matches  your  query.  Also,  note  that,  by
  default, Xarchie scrolls the browser pane when you select an
  item.  This makes it easy to click through a  long  list  of
  matches,  but  can be annoying. If you don't like it, it can
  be changed on the Settings Panel (described below), and  see
  the  description of the <STRONG>-noscroll</STRONG> command-line option in the
  REFERENCE MANUAL.

  The  browser   allows   you   to   select   multiple   items
  simultaneously,  although  of  course only the last-selected
  item will have it's  information  displayed  in  the  bottom
  pane.  You  add  to  a selection by clicking the Left button
  with Shift depressed. If  the  clicked-on  item  is  already
  selected,  it will be unselected. Currently, only the bottom
  level of the browser can have multiple selections,  since  a
  selection  at  a  higher level clears the selections for all
  lower levels (this may be changed in the future).  Thus  you
  can  select  multiple  files  from  a  single  host, but not
  multiple files from separate hosts.

<STRONG>Expanding</STRONG> <STRONG>the</STRONG> <STRONG>Browser</STRONG>
  The browser can be expanded, allowing  you  to  investigate,
  say,  a  directory  that  matched  your query. To select and
  expand an directory, double-click on it  (double-click  with
  Shift  to  avoid  unselecting any other items). You can also
  select "Open" from  the  File  Menu  to  expand  directories
  (although  this  will also open selected files, as described
  later).  All  selected  directories  will  be  expanded   by
  querying  an  appropriate Archie server, and the Status area
  will keep you informed.  Expansion requests can  be  aborted
  just like queries using the "Abort" button.

  If only a single item was expanded, and if the expansion was
  successful,  then  the  browser  will  scroll to display the
  results. The arrow buttons across the top of the browser can
  be  used  to  scroll the browser left or right when they are
  active. The Middle and Right mouse buttons or the  Left  and
  Right arrow keys will do the same thing, when the pointer is
  in the browser panes.

<STRONG>Viewing</STRONG> <STRONG>Files</STRONG>
  You can view a file that  is  selected  in  the  browser  by
  selecting  "Open"  from the File Menu (or by typing Meta-O).
  Xarchie retrieves all selected files in ASCII  mode  into  a
  temporary directory.  The Status area, like usual, will keep
  you posted on the progress of the operation  and,  once  the
  FTP  connection is established, the Abort button can be used
  to abort the Open operation.  If you  abort  and  there  are
  files  remaining  to  retrieve,  you  will be prompted as to
  whether  to  continue  with  the  next   file.   Note   that
  partially-retrieved   files   are  not  removed.   There  is
  currently no way to abort the transfer until the  connection
  is  established.  The connection will eventually timeout and
  control will return to Xarchie if connection is impossible.

  Each file is displayed in a popup Text  window  after  being
  retrieved.    Use   the  "Down"  and  "Up"  buttons  or  the
  scrollbars to view the text.  Click on the "Dismiss"  button
  to  destroy the window and delete the file. To save the file
  before dismissing, use the "Save" button.  This  pops  up  a
  panel  with  which  you  can  choose the name of the file to
  which to save.

  Note that  because  the  Archie  database  is  only  updated
  periodically,  some  files  returned by Archie may not exist
  when you attempt to retrieve them. This and  any  other  FTP
  errors are signalled with alert boxes.

<STRONG>Retrieving</STRONG> <STRONG>Files</STRONG>
  The "Open" action should be used to view short  files,  such
  as  "README"  files,  that  you don't need to save. For more
  permanent  files,  and  for  non-ASCII  files  like  tar  or
  compressed   files,  Xarchie  allows  you  to  retrieve  the
  selected browser items using the "Get" item of the File Menu
  (or typing Meta-G). The selected files are retrieved via FTP
  and stored in the current directory (see  the  section  "FTP
  Parameters"  in  the  "Advanced  Usage"  section  for how to
  change this).  The "Status" area is updated to  reflect  the
  progress  of  the transfer. As for "Open", you can abort the
  retrieval using the "Abort" button once the  FTP  connection
  is established.

  It is  currently  not  possible  to  retrieve  a  directory,
  although  of  course  the  directory  can  be opened and the
  entire contents selected for transfer.

  Note that  because  the  Archie  database  is  only  updated
  periodically,  some  files  returned by Archie may not exist
  when you attempt to retrieve them. This and  any  other  FTP
  errors are signalled with alert boxes.

  As with querying, if your window manager and  version  of  X
  support  it,  Xarchie's  icon will be changed to reflect the
  progress of a transfer.

<STRONG>Saving,</STRONG> <STRONG>Loading,</STRONG> <STRONG>and</STRONG> <STRONG>Writing</STRONG>
  Xarchie allows you to save and reload the  contents  of  the
  browser,  or  write  it  in  human-readable format using the
  items on the File menu.  Selecting either of "Save", "Load",
  or   "Write"   (or   typing   Meta-S,   Meta-L,  or  Meta-W,
  respectively) will pop up the File Panel with which you  can
  specify  the  appropriate  filename.   Clicking  on the "Ok"
  button will invoke the appropriate action; clicking "Cancel"
  will abort the operation and pop down the panel.

  Saving the database creates  a  file  containing  sufficient
  information for the browser to be reloaded using "Load". The
  output is not intended for human  consumption.  The  current
  Settings  are  also  written  to  the file by "Save" and are
  restored by "Load".

  Users  should  note  that  a  reloaded  database   will   be
  "flattened",  that  is,  directories  will  be  added to the
  middle pane as needed to fit  everything  in  three  browser
  panes.   (This  may be changed in the future to preserve the
  original hierarchy.)

  Writing the database is intended to create  files  that  are
  more  or  less  human-readable (compared to "Save", anyway).
  There are two possible formats, selectable from  the  "Write
  Format"  menu  on  the  panel.  If  "One  entry per line" is
  selected, then the output will have one line per  entry,  in
  the format

			   mode size date host:location/file

  If "Pretty-printed" is selected, then the  file  format  has
  hostnames  starting  at  the beginning of the line, location
  names indented one tab, and file entries indented two  tabs,
  all  on  separate  lines.   Hostnames and locations are only
  printed once, as in:

		  host
				  location
						  mode size date file
						  mode size date file

  The latter is more readable, the former may be  more  useful
  if the output is to be used by a program.

<STRONG>Quitting</STRONG> <STRONG>Xarchie</STRONG>
  You can exit Xarchie by selecting "Quit" from the File  Menu
  (or typing Meta-Q).

<STRONG>Advanced</STRONG> <STRONG>Xarchie</STRONG> <STRONG>Usage</STRONG>
  This section describes  how  various  aspects  of  Xarchie's
  functionality  can  be modified to perform different queries
  and other operations.  Further customization information  is
  found in the REFERENCE MANUAL section.

<STRONG>The</STRONG> <STRONG>Settings</STRONG> <STRONG>Panel</STRONG>
  The panel popped up by selecting  "Other"  on  the  Settings
  Menu  in  the  top  Xarchie  pane  allows  you to change the
  parameters of your queries Archie. Each of the parameters is
  described in the following sections.

  After you're done with the Settings Panel, clicking  on  the
  "Apply"  button will make Xarchie use the settings as set on
  the panel.  Clicking on "Default" will reset the settings to
  the  values they had when Xarchie started (but note that you
  will still have to apply them to  have  them  take  effect).
  Clicking  on  "Done"  closes  the  Settings  panel.  A popup
  confirmer will appear if you did  not  apply  your  changes,
  allowing  you  to  discard  the changes or go back and apply
  them. Note that the  "Apply"  button  is  inactive  until  a
  change is made.

  The menus available  from  the  "Search Type",  "Sort Type",
  "Nice   Level"  and  "Archie Host"  submenus of the Settings
  Menu on the Xarchie top pane have effects  corresponding  to
  those of the buttons on the Settings Panel. However, they do
  not require that the "Apply" button be clicked  on  to  take
  effect, and do not affect the behaviour of the "Done" button
  confirmer.

<STRONG>Archie</STRONG> <STRONG>host</STRONG>
  The item labelled "Host" provides a  menu  of  known  Archie
  hosts. You should choose one appropriate to your site (i.e.,
  one that minimizes long-distance transmission).  In addition
  however,  you  can  enter  an arbitrary hostname in the Text
  item next to the "Host" button.  Note that the  Archie  host
  is only used for queries; expansion requests use information
  stored with the items to determine which  host  to  contact.
  That  is,  changing  the  Archie host does not "take effect"
  until the next query is issued.

  If you have the <EM>ping</EM>(1) program, you can try to use it  with
  the its "-s" option to locate a "nearby" host.

  You can specify hostnames using either the symbolic name  or
  by  giving  its numeric IP address (four octets separated by
  periods). In either case, you can specify the port at  which
  the  Prospero  server  should  be  contacted by giving it in
  parentheses immediately following the hostname (no spaces).

<STRONG>Search</STRONG> <STRONG>mode</STRONG>
  The "Search Mode"  item  allow  you  to  change  how  Archie
  interprets  your  search  term.  Holding a mouse button down
  while the mouse cursor is on the button displays a menu from
  which  you can choose the desired search type.  The label to
  the right of the item is updated to reflect the choice.

  The <EM>exact</EM> mode is fastest and returns files exactly matching
  your  search  term.   The  <EM>substr</EM>  and  <EM>subcase</EM> modes return
  substring and case-sensitive substring matches  respectively
  (i.e.,  <EM>substr</EM>  means  case-insensitive).  The  <EM>regexp</EM>  mode
  allows you to specify a regular expression to  select  files
  (see  <EM>ed</EM>(1) for a description of regular expression syntax).
  The <EM>exact</EM>* forms of these last  three  try  an  exact  match
  first  and  then fall back on the more costly search type if
  the exact match fails.

<STRONG>Sort</STRONG> <STRONG>mode</STRONG>
  The "Sort Mode" item  allows  you  to  specify  how  Xarchie
  displays  the  results  from Archie.  Holding a mouse button
  down while the mouse cursor is in this item displays a  menu
  from  which you can choose the desired sort type.  The label
  to the right of the item is updated to reflect  the  choice.
  Applying  the settings (see above) will cause the data to be
  resorted according to the new sort mode.

  The type can be one of <EM>name</EM>, <EM>date</EM>, or  <EM>weight</EM>.   Sorting  by
  <EM>name</EM> is simple lexicographic ordering.

  If sorting by <EM>date</EM>  is  selected,  then  hosts  are  ordered
  according  to  the most recent file among those returned for
  them, and similarly  for  locations.  Files  themselves  are
  ordered by last-modification date, naturally.

  If sorting by <EM>weight</EM> is selected, then hosts are ordered  by
  a  user-definable  set of "weights". In this way, hosts that
  are "close" (in some sense) are displayed first. The weights
  can  be set using the Text item that appears on the Settings
  Panel when this sort mode is selected.

  Hopefully, an appropriate weight  list  for  the  geographic
  location  of  your  site  will  have  been  installed as the
  default. In any case, the the weight list is a set of lines,
  where  each  line  specifies a weight and the set of domains
  for that weight. A host's weight is  determined  by  finding
  the  first line for which the end of the host's name matches
  one of the suffixes. A host that  belongs  in  none  of  the
  classes  is assigned the weight 99. For example, the default
  for the USA is:

		 1 edu com net gov mil us\n\
		 2 ca\n\
		 3 uk de nl fi fr eu.net\n\
	   100 au nz jp

  This means that all the US domains are ordered  first,  then
  Canada, then several European countries. Hosts in Australia,
  New Zealand, and Japan are ordered <EM>after</EM> any  unknown  (i.e.
  non-matching) hosts.

  For more details, see the  description  of  the  <STRONG>hostWeights</STRONG>
  non-widget resource in the REFERENCE MANUAL section.

<STRONG>Nice</STRONG> <STRONG>level</STRONG>
  The "Nice Level" item deserves special mention. As mentioned
  in  the  "About  Archie"  section,  Archie  servers  run  on
  machines that must be shared between other Archie users  and
  even other "real" users. This item allows you to voluntarily
  lower the priority of your request, just  like  the  <EM>nice</EM>(1)
  command  does  for  Unix. The menu provides some recommended
  values and you can enter arbitrary values in the text  item.
  If  you  are  searching  with  a  large  number  of  matches
  requested, please increase your nice level.

  Note that, like <EM>nice</EM>(1), nicing a job does not mean your job
  won't affect others.  In particular, once your job begins it
  is not pre-empted, thus you should  still  avoid  long  jobs
  during peak periods. You should especially avoid queries for
  items of only personal interest  (you  know  what  we  mean)
  during  these  periods.  As  stated  above,  abusers  of the
  service may find their access revoked without notice.

<STRONG>Other</STRONG> <STRONG>Query</STRONG> <STRONG>Settings</STRONG>
  The following items set parameters  of  your  query  to  the
  Archie server.

  Max Hits:
	   the limit on the number of successful matches that will
	   be returned.

  Initial Timeout:
	   the length of the first timeout interval in seconds.

  Retries:
	   the number of times to retry a query if it  times  out,
	   doubling the timeout each retry.

  These items are Text items that  allow  you  to  edit  their
  values.

  The item labelled "Auto-Scroll Browser" controls whether the
  browser  scrolls  after an item is selected. Setting this to
  "yes" is useful when browsing a long list of matches. It can
  be  annoying if you're doing more selective browsing, so set
  it to "no" in those cases.

<STRONG>FTP</STRONG> <STRONG>settings</STRONG>
  The following items allow you  to  set  parameters  of  file
  retrieval.  You  should  be  sure they are appropriately set
  before retrieving files using either "Open" or "Get".

  FTP Email Address:
	   Specifies the password used for anonymous FTP login. By
	   convention,  users logging in as "anonymous" send their
	   email address as the  password.  Some  servers  enforce
	   this  by  checking  the address. The default may not be
	   appropriate depending on what information Xarchie could
	   glean  from  your system about its address. You can set
	   the environment variables <STRONG>USER</STRONG> and <STRONG>HOSTNAME</STRONG> to override
	   the system's information, or see the description of the
	   <STRONG>ftpMailAddress</STRONG> non-widget  resource  in  the  REFERENCE
	   MANUAL.

  FTP Local Directory:
	   Specifies  the  directory  into  which  files  will  be
	   retrieved using "Get".

  FTP Transfer Type:
	   Provides a menu from which you can  select  "ascii"  or
	   "binary"  mode transfer for files retrieved with "Get".
	   Files retrieved with "Open"  are  always  retrieved  in
	   ascii mode.

  FTP Prompt:
	   Provides a menu  allowing  you  to  enable  or  disable
	   prompting during multi-file transfers.

  Trace FTP Transfers:
	   Since FTP transfers are  susceptible  to  timeouts  and
	   other  confusions,  this item allows you to monitor any
	   FTP interactions. If tracing is enabled, then  invoking
	   "Open"  or  "Get"  on  a file will popup a trace window
	   that displays a running log of the FTP  session  as  it
	   happens.   Using  this  successfully  requires that you
	   understand something about  how  FTP  works,  which  is
	   beyond the scope of this document.

  Strip CR
	   If this option is enabled, then  carriage  returns  are
	   removed   from   ASCII-mode   files.  This  is  usually
	   desirable when transferring to a Unix machine.

<STRONG>Querying</STRONG> <STRONG>Hosts</STRONG> <STRONG>and</STRONG> <STRONG>Locations</STRONG>
  The Query Menu provides two other types of  queries  besides
  the  "Query Item" described in the "Basic Usage" section for
  querying the Archie database.

  Selecting "Query Host" will use the hostname in  the  "Host"
  Text  item on the bottom pane and will fill the browser with
  the contents of the root of its FTP directory. From then on,
  interaction  is  as  previously described. The host to query
  can be in the "Host" item as a result of selecting a host in
  the browser, or you can type directly into the item the name
  of the host that you wish to  open.  Typing  Return  in  the
  "Host" item is equivalent to selecting "Query Host" from the
  Query Menu.

  Querying locations by selecting "Query Location" is similar:
  the  Archie  server  is  queried  for  the  contents  of the
  directory given by the "Location" item on the host given  by
  the  "Host"  item. The browser is filled in with the results
  of the query (i.e.,  the  contents  of  the  directory).  As
  before,  you  can  type  the  name  of the location into the
  "Location" item if you wish, and typing Return there is  the
  same as invoking "Query Location".

  Note that  because  the  Archie  database  is  only  updated
  periodically,  some  files  returned by Archie may not exist
  when you attempt to retrieve them. Similarly, recently added
  files may exist on the host but not in the Archie database.

<STRONG>REFERENCE</STRONG> <STRONG>MANUAL</STRONG>
  This section provides all the information you should need to
  customize    Xarchie.   Command-line   options,   non-widget
  resources, widget  hierarchies,  translations  actions,  and
  other  information  are all provided. It is assumed that you
  understand enough about X applications to understand this.

<STRONG>Command-line</STRONG> <STRONG>Options</STRONG>
  The following non-widget  resources  can  be  set  from  the
  command-line  or in a resource file. As usual, when given on
  the command line they can be abbreviated to  their  shortest
  unique  prefix, often the first letter.  Furthermore Xarchie
  accepts all the standard X Toolkit options (see <STRONG>X</STRONG>(1)).

  <STRONG>-host</STRONG> host
	   Sets the host to which Archie  queries  will  be  sent.
	   Please  be  careful  to  use the nearest possible host.
	   You can specify hostnames  using  either  the  symbolic
	   name  or  by giving its numeric IP address (four octets
	   separated by periods). In either case, you can  specify
	   the  port  at  which  the  Prospero  server  should  be
	   contacted  by  giving  it  in  parentheses  immediately
	   following the hostname (no spaces).

	   The default  is  "archie.sura.net(1526)".  This  option
	   corresponds to the <STRONG>archieHost</STRONG> resource.

  <STRONG>-search</STRONG> type
	   Sets the search mode for Archie queries. The  type  can
	   be  one of <EM>exact</EM>, <EM>substr</EM>, <EM>subcase</EM>, <EM>regexp</EM>, <EM>exactSubstr</EM>,
	   <EM>exactSubcase</EM>,  or   <EM>exactRegexp</EM>.    See   the   section
	   describing the Settings Panel in the USER'S GUIDE for a
	   description of the various search types.   The  default
	   search  mode  is <EM>exact</EM>.  This option corresponds to the
	   <STRONG>searchType</STRONG> resource.

  <STRONG>-e</STRONG>   Equivalent to "<STRONG>-search</STRONG> <STRONG>exact</STRONG>".

  <STRONG>-s</STRONG>   Equivalent to "<STRONG>-search</STRONG> <STRONG>substr</STRONG>".

  <STRONG>-c</STRONG>   Equivalent to "<STRONG>-search</STRONG> <STRONG>subcase</STRONG>".

  <STRONG>-r</STRONG>   Equivalent to "<STRONG>-search</STRONG> <STRONG>regexp</STRONG>".

  <STRONG>-es</STRONG>  Equivalent to "<STRONG>-search</STRONG> <STRONG>exactSubstr</STRONG>".

  <STRONG>-ec</STRONG>  Equivalent to "<STRONG>-search</STRONG> <STRONG>exactSsubcase</STRONG>".

  <STRONG>-er</STRONG>  Equivalent to "<STRONG>-search</STRONG> <STRONG>exactRegexp</STRONG>".

  <STRONG>-sort</STRONG> type
	   Sets the sort mode for displaying Archie responses. The
	   type  can  be  one  of  <EM>name</EM>, <EM>date</EM>, or <EM>weight</EM>.  See the
	   section describing the Settings  Panel  in  the  USER'S
	   GUIDE  for  a  description  of  the various sort types.
	   This option corresponds to the <STRONG>sortType</STRONG> resource.

  <STRONG>-t</STRONG>   Equivalent to "<STRONG>-sort</STRONG> <STRONG>date</STRONG>".

  <STRONG>-w</STRONG>   Equivalent to "<STRONG>-sort</STRONG> <STRONG>weight</STRONG>".

  <STRONG>-maxHits</STRONG> num
	   Sets the maximum number of matches allowed  per  query.
	   This option corresponds to the <STRONG>maxHits</STRONG> resource.

  <STRONG>-offset</STRONG> num
	   Sets the offset of  the  Prospero  query.  This  option
	   corresponds to the <STRONG>offset</STRONG> resource.

  <STRONG>-nice</STRONG> level or <STRONG>-N</STRONG> level
	   Sets the  query  niceness  level.  Higher  numbers  are
	   nicer,  up  to a maximum niceness of 32765. The default
	   niceness is 0. This option corresponds to the <STRONG>niceLevel</STRONG>
	   resource.

  <STRONG>-noscroll</STRONG>
	   By  default,  Xarchie   scrolls   the   browser   lists
	   automatically when you select items. This usually makes
	   it easier to scan through the results  of  queries  but
	   can  be  annoying.  This option turns off the automatic
	   scrolling. It corresponds to the <STRONG>autoScroll</STRONG> resource.

  <STRONG>-mono</STRONG> or <STRONG>-gray</STRONG> or <STRONG>-color</STRONG>
	   By default, Xarchie will determine the visual  type  of
	   your  display and use the proper color resources. If it
	   gets  it  wrong,  you  can  override  the  default   by
	   specifying one of these options. They correspond to the
	   <STRONG>visualType</STRONG> resource.

  <STRONG>-debug</STRONG> level or <STRONG>-D</STRONG> level
	   Sets the Prospero debugging level. Higher numbers  mean
	   more  verbose messages.  This option corresponds to the
	   <STRONG>debugLevel</STRONG>  resource.   <EM>Xarchie</EM>   must   be   specially
	   compiled  for  this  option to have any effect (see the
	   Imakefile or your local installer).

  <STRONG>-help</STRONG> or <STRONG>-?</STRONG>
	   Prints the usage message summarizing Xarchie options.

<STRONG>Non-widget</STRONG> <STRONG>Resources</STRONG>
  <EM>Xarchie</EM> has a default set of resources built in. If you wish
  to   customize   the  tool,  take  a  copy  of  the  default
  application defaults file (see the section  "Files",  below)
  and  modify  it.  Then,  before  invoking  Xarchie,  set the
  environment variable <STRONG>XAPPLRESDIR</STRONG> to the directory containing
  your  private  copy. Alternatively, you can place entries in
  your .Xdefaults file or provide them with the  <STRONG>-xrm</STRONG>  toolkit
  option (see <STRONG>X</STRONG>(1)).  Most of the following resources can also
  be set using  the  command-line  options  described  in  the
  previous section.

<STRONG>Query</STRONG> <STRONG>Resources</STRONG>
  <STRONG>archieHost</STRONG>
	   Sets the host to which Archie  queries  will  be  sent.
	   Please be careful to use the nearest possible host. The
	   default is "archie.sura.net".  This resource can be set
	   with the <STRONG>-host</STRONG> option or on the Settings Panel.

	   You can specify hostnames  using  either  the  symbolic
	   name  or  by giving its numeric IP address (four octets
	   separated by periods). In either case, you can  specify
	   the  port  at  which  the  Prospero  server  should  be
	   contacted  by  giving  it  in  parentheses  immediately
	   following the hostname (no spaces).

  <STRONG>searchType</STRONG>
	   Sets the search mode for Archie queries.  This  can  be
	   one  of  <EM>exact</EM>,  <EM>substr</EM>,  <EM>subcase</EM>, <EM>regexp</EM>, <EM>exactSubstr</EM>,
	   <EM>exactSubcase</EM>,  or   <EM>exactRegexp</EM>.    See   the   section
	   describing the Settings Panel in the USER'S GUIDE for a
	   description of the various search types.   The  default
	   search  mode  is  <EM>exact</EM>.  This resource can be set with
	   the <STRONG>-search</STRONG> option, or its abbreviations  <STRONG>-e</STRONG>,  <STRONG>-s</STRONG>,  <STRONG>-c</STRONG>,
	   <STRONG>-r</STRONG>, <STRONG>-es</STRONG>, <STRONG>-ec</STRONG>, or <STRONG>-er</STRONG>, or on the Settings Panel.

  <STRONG>sortType</STRONG>
	   Sets the sort mode  for  displaying  Archie  responses.
	   This  can  be  one  of  <EM>name</EM>, <EM>date</EM>, or <EM>weight</EM>.  See the
	   section of the Settings Panel, above, for a description
	   of  the various search types.  This resource can be set
	   with the <STRONG>-sort</STRONG> option, or its abbreviations <STRONG>-t</STRONG>  or  <STRONG>-w</STRONG>,
	   or on the Settings Panel.

  <STRONG>hostWeights</STRONG>
	   Specifies the weights used to order hosts when  sorting
	   by <EM>weight</EM> is selected. The format of this resource is a
	   series of entries of the form:

					weight host [hosts...] {,|\n}

	   where parts of an entry are separated by spaces or tabs
	   and  entries are separated by a comma or newline.  Each
	   entry specifies a  weight  and  a  series  of  possible
	   suffixes  (one  or  more trailing components). A host's
	   weight is determined by finding  the  first  class  for
	   which  the  end  of  the host's name matches one of the
	   suffixes. A host that belongs in none of the classes is
	   assigned  the  weight  99. For example, the default for
	   the USA is:

			  1 edu com net gov mil us\n\
			  2 ca\n\
			  3 uk de nl fi fr eu.net\n\
			100 au nz jp

	   This means that all the US domains are  ordered  first,
	   then  Canada, then several European countries. Hosts in
	   Australia, New Zealand, and Japan are ordered <EM>after</EM> any
	   unknown (i.e. non-matching) hosts. This resource can be
	   set on the Settings Panel.

	   If this resource is not defined, Xarchie  will  attempt
	   to make an intelligent choice by comparing the system's
	   idea  of  its  hostname  with  a  set  of  pre-compiled
	   defaults. This may not work, but is usually better than
	   nothing, and it can always be edited  on  the  Settings
	   Panel anyway.

  <STRONG>niceLevel</STRONG>
	   Sets the  query  niceness  level.  Higher  numbers  are
	   nicer,  up  to a maximum niceness of 32765. The default
	   is 0. This resource can be set with the <STRONG>-nice</STRONG> option or
	   on the Settings Panel.

  <STRONG>maxHits</STRONG>
	   Sets the maximum number of matches allowed  per  query.
	   The  default  is 99.  This resource can be set with the
	   <STRONG>-maxHits</STRONG> option or on the Settings Panel.

  <STRONG>offset</STRONG>
	   Sets the Prospero  offset.  The  default  is  0.   This
	   resource  can  be set with the <STRONG>-offset</STRONG> option or on the
	   Settings Panel.

  <STRONG>timeout</STRONG>
	   Sets the initial timeout value, in seconds. The default
	   is 4. This resource can be set on the Settings Panel.

  <STRONG>retries</STRONG>
	   Sets the number of retries, where the  timeout  doubles
	   every  retry.  This resource can be set on the Settings
	   Panel.

  <STRONG>debugLevel</STRONG>
	   Sets the Prospero debugging level. Higher numbers  mean
	   more verbose messages.  Xarchie must have been compiled
	   specially for this option to have any effect  (see  the
	   Imakefile  or  your local installer). This resource can
	   be set with the <STRONG>-debug</STRONG> or <STRONG>-D</STRONG> options.

<STRONG>Browser</STRONG> <STRONG>Resources</STRONG>
  <STRONG>autoScroll</STRONG>
	   By  default,  Xarchie   scrolls   the   browser   lists
	   automatically when you select items. This usually makes
	   it easier to scan through the results  of  queries  but
	   can  be  annoying.  This  resource  enables or disables
	   automatic scrolling.  The default is True.  It  can  be
	   set  to  False  with  the  <STRONG>-noscroll</STRONG>  option and can be
	   changed on the Settings Panel.

  <STRONG>pasteBuffer</STRONG>
	   If  this  resource  is  True  (the  default),   browser
	   selections  are  stored in the CUT_BUFFER_0 property of
	   the root window of the Xarchie display in the format:

						 <EM>host</EM>:<EM>location</EM>/<EM>file</EM>

	   This allows them to be used by other applications using
	   XFetchBytes(3X).   The  Xarchie distribution includes a
	   sample program (xcutbuf.c) that retrieves the  contents
	   of a cutbuffer property.

<STRONG>FTP</STRONG> <STRONG>Resources</STRONG>
  <STRONG>ftpMailAddress</STRONG>
	   By convention, FTP users are  expected  to  send  their
	   email  address  as the password during anonymous login.
	   The string specified by  this  resource  is  passed  to
	   sprintf(3)  along with two parameters: the username and
	   the hostname (as indicated by the system or by the <STRONG>USER</STRONG>
	   and  <STRONG>HOSTNAME</STRONG> environment variables), and the result is
	   used as the password  for  anonymous  FTP  logins.  The
	   default  is "%s@%s". You should change this resource if
	   your system returns strange  or  incorrect  values  for
	   either  parameter.  The password (after sprintf) can be
	   edited on the Settings Panel.

  <STRONG>ftpLocalDir</STRONG>
	   Sets the local destination directory for ftp transfers.
	   This  will  be  used  as  the initial value of the "FTP
	   Local Dir" item on the Settings Panel.

  <STRONG>ftpType</STRONG>
	   Sets the transfer type for ftp transfers. This will  be
	   used  as  the  initial value of the "Ftp transfer type"
	   item on the  Settings  Panel.   It  should  be  one  of
	   "ascii" or "binary".

  <STRONG>ftpPrompt</STRONG>
	   Specifies whether to  prompt  for  verification  during
	   transfers  involving  multiple files. This will be used
	   as the initial value of the "Prompt  during  transfers"
	   item on the Settings Panel.

  <STRONG>ftpTrace</STRONG>
	   Specifies whether to pop  up  a  window  in  which  FTP
	   transactions  are  monitored.  This will be used as the
	   initial value of the "Trace FTP transfers" item on  the
	   Settings Panel.

  <STRONG>ftpStrip</STRONG>
	   Specifies whether to strip carriage returns from  files
	   transferred  in  ASCII  mode.  This will be used as the
	   initial value of the "Strip CR" item  on  the  Settings
	   Panel.

<STRONG>Database</STRONG> <STRONG>Writing</STRONG> <STRONG>Resources</STRONG>
  <STRONG>fileWriteOnePerLine</STRONG>
	   Specifies the format of files written by "Write".  This
	   will be used as the initial value of the "Write format"
	   item on the File Panel.  The meaning of this setting is
	   described  in  the  USER'S  GUIDE  section  on "Saving,
	   Loading, and Writing".

<STRONG>Special</STRONG> <STRONG>Font</STRONG> <STRONG>Resources</STRONG>
  Xarchie uses two fonts by  default:  one  "normal"  and  one
  "bold".   However,  because  of  widget  naming and resource
  lookup conventions, these fonts must be  specified  in  many
  places  in  the resource file. To make it easier to find and
  change these fonts, the following two resources are defined:

  <STRONG>xarchieFont</STRONG>
	   The name of the default font used by  Xarchie  widgets.
	   If   any   widget   specifies   a   font   resource  as
	   "xarchieFont", this font will be used.

  <STRONG>xarchieBoldFont</STRONG>
	   Like the above, but specifies  the  font  used  by  any
	   widget    that    specifies    a   font   resource   of
	   "xarchieBoldFont".

  The resource converter that looks up fontnames  is  modified
  so  that  the  the  two  special  strings  "xarchieFont" and
  "xarchieBoldFont" result in  the  corresponding  font  being
  returned; other strings are looked up as normal fontnames.

<STRONG>Other</STRONG> <STRONG>Resources</STRONG>
  <STRONG>visualType</STRONG>
	   This resource allows you to override Xarchie's  builtin
	   determination  of the type of display, which it uses to
	   specify appropriate color resources.  You  can  specify
	   "mon",   "gray",  or  "color"  as  the  value  of  this
	   resource. It can also be  set  with  the  corresponding
	   command-line options.

  <STRONG>defaultIcon</STRONG>
	   If given, this resource specifies  the  name  of  an  X
	   bitmap  file  that  will be used as Xarchie's icon when
	   not querying (assuming you are using a  window  manager
	   that  supports icon pixmaps). The X resource conversion
	   routines will look for the file in a variety of places,
	   including  directories  given  by  the  global resource
	   <STRONG>bitmapFilePath</STRONG>.

  <STRONG>busyIcon</STRONG>
	   If given, this resource specifies  the  name  of  an  X
	   bitmap  file  that  will be used as Xarchie's icon when
	   querying  (see  the  description  of  the   <STRONG>defaultIcon</STRONG>
	   resource,  above).  The  icon  is  changed  back to the
	   default when the query completes, so you can watch  for
	   a change while Xarchie is iconified.

<STRONG>Widget</STRONG> <STRONG>Hierarchies</STRONG>
  Xarchie uses primarily Athena widgets, with some extra  sub-
  classes as described below.

<STRONG>Main</STRONG> <STRONG>Xarchie</STRONG> <STRONG>Widgets</STRONG>
  The widget hierarchy for the  main  Xarchie  display  is  as
  follows:

  Xarchie xarchie
	[Form color|gray] &lt;-- Color or gray-scale displays only
	   Paned outerPaned
			Form buttonForm
				 MenuButton fileButton
				 MenuButton settingsButton
				 MenuButton queryButton
				 Command abortButton
				 Command helpButton
				 Label,Text status{Label,Text}
			Form browserForm
				 Command browserUpButton
				 Command browserDownButton
				 Paned browserPaned
					  Viewport browserViewport0
						   XfwfMultiList browserList0
					  Viewport browserViewport1
						   XfwfMultiList browserList1
					  Viewport browserViewport2
						   XfwfMultiList browserList2
			Form stringForm
				 Label,Text search{Label,Text}
				 Label,Text host{Label,Text}
				 Label,Text location{Label,Text}
				 Label,Text file{Label,Text}
				 Label,Text size{Label,Text}
				 Label,Text modes{Label,Text}
				 Label,Text date{Label,Text}

  On color displays, there  is  an  extra  Form  widget  named
  "color" created as the only child of the toplevel shell, and
  all other widgets are children of it. This allows  resources
  that  are  only  applicable  for  color  displays to use the
  prefix "Xarchie.color" while generally applicable  resources
  should  use  the  "Xarchie*" prefix. On gray-scale displays,
  the extra widget is named "gray". On monochrome displays, no
  extra widget is created.

  The XfwfMultiList widget is a modification of  the  standard
  Athena   List  widget  that  allows  multiple  items  to  be
  selected.    It    was    written     by     Brian     Totty
  (totty@flute.cs.uiuc.edu)  and  is  distributed  by the Free
  Widget       Foundation        (contact        free-widgets-
  request@kazoo.cs.uiuc.edu).   <EM>Xarchie</EM> can be compiled to use
  standard Athena List widgets instead. See the  Imakefile  or
  your local installer.

  To  describe  this  widget  hierarchy  briefly,   <EM>outerPaned</EM>
  controls  the relative sizes of the three horizontal display
  areas while <EM>browserPaned</EM> allows the  browser  panels  to  be
  resized  independently.  Each  browser  panel  consists of a
  Viewport to allow it to  scroll  and  an  XfwfMultiList  (or
  List) to display the entries.

  The  command  buttons  and   status   widgets   are   pretty
  straightforward.  The <EM>fileButton</EM> pops up the <EM>fileMenu</EM>, whose
  items invoke the obvious actions (see below) when  selected.
  The <EM>settingsButton</EM> pops up the <EM>settingsMenu</EM>, which uses some
  special translations and the  <STRONG>settings-submenu()</STRONG>  action  to
  permit  the  use of pullright submenus. The <EM>queryButton</EM> pops
  up the <EM>queryMenu</EM>, the <EM>abortButton</EM> (when active) invokes  the
  <STRONG>abort()</STRONG> action, and the <EM>helpButton</EM> invokes the <STRONG>help()</STRONG> action
  to pop up the Help panel.

  In the bottom pane, the <EM>searchText</EM> widget is used  to  enter
  the  search  term,  and  by  default  it binds Return to the
  <STRONG>query()</STRONG> action (see below) to send the query to Archie.  The
  <EM>hostText</EM>  binds  Return to <STRONG>query-host()</STRONG> and the <EM>locationText</EM>
  binds Return to <STRONG>query-location()</STRONG>.  All the other Text  items
  in  the  <EM>stringForm</EM> cannot be edited and are used to display
  information about the current browser selection.

<STRONG>Settings</STRONG> <STRONG>Panel</STRONG> <STRONG>Widgets</STRONG>
  The "Panel" item on the Settings menu pops up  the  Settings
  Panel, which has the following widget hierarchy:

	   TopLevelShell settingsShell
			Form settingsForm
				 Command setDoneButton
				 Command setApplyButton
				 Command setDefaultButton
				 MenuButton,AsciiText setHost{Button,Text}
				 MenuButton,Label setSearch{Button,Label}
				 MenuButton,Label setSort{Button,Label}
				 Label,AsciiText setHostWeights{Label,Text}
				 MenuButton,AsciiText setNice{Button,Text}
				 Label,AsciiText setMaxHits{Label,Text}
				 Label,AsciiText setTimeout{Label,Text}
				 Label,AsciiText setRetries{Label,Text}
				 Label,AsciiText setAutoScroll{Button,Label}
				 Label,AsciiText ftpMailAddress{Label,Text}
				 Label,AsciiText ftpLocalDir{Label,Text}
				 MenuButton,Label ftpType{Button,Label}
				 MenuButton,Label ftpPrompt{Button,Label}
				 MenuButton,Label ftpTrace{Button,Label}
				 MenuButton,Label ftpStrip{Button,Label}

  The <EM>setDoneButton</EM> invokes the  <STRONG>settings-done()</STRONG>  action,  the
  <EM>setApplyButton</EM>    invokes    <STRONG>settings-apply()</STRONG>,    and    the
  <EM>setDefaultButton</EM> invokes  <STRONG>settings-default()</STRONG>.   The  actions
  are  described  below.   The MenuButton widgets pop up menus
  described below under "Menus".  The  AsciiText  widgets  are
  used to display and edit the corresponding parameters.

<STRONG>File</STRONG> <STRONG>Panel</STRONG> <STRONG>Widgets</STRONG>
  The "Save", "Load", and "Write" items on the File  menu  pop
  up the File panel, which has the following widget hierarchy:

  TopLevelShell fileShell
	   Form fileForm
			Label fileLabel
			XfwfFileChooser fileChooser
			Label,AsciiText filename{Label,Text}
			MenuButton,Label fileWriteMode{Button,Label}
			Command fileOkButton, fileCancelButton


  The XfwfFileChooser widget provides a browser for  selecting
  files.   <EM>Xarchie</EM> can be compiled without the FileChooser, if
  necessary.  See the Imakefile or your local installer.

  In any event, the  <EM>fileLabel</EM>  indicates  what  operation  is
  being  performed, the fileChooser, fileText, and buttons are
  used to select a file, and the <EM>fileWriteModeButton</EM>  pops  up
  the  <EM>fileWriteModeMenu</EM>  (only  enabled  for  Write).  Typing
  Return in the <EM>filenameText</EM>  is  the  same  as  clicking  the
  <EM>fileOkButton</EM>,   and  sending  the  WM_DELETE_WINDOW  message
  (typically from the window manager) is the same as  clicking
  on the <EM>fileCancelButton</EM>.

<STRONG>View</STRONG> <STRONG>Window</STRONG> <STRONG>Widgets</STRONG>
  Whenever a file is retrieved by "Open", it is displayed in a
  window with the following widget hierarchy:

  TopLevelShell viewShell
	   Form viewForm
			Command viewDoneButton
			Command viewDownButton
			Command viewUpButton
			Command viewSaveButton
			Text viewText

  The title of the TopLevel shell is set to  the  basename  of
  the file being viewed in the <EM>viewText</EM>.  The operation of the
  buttons is all hard-coded.  Clicking on  the  <EM>viewSaveButton</EM>
  results in the following panel being displayed to select the
  file to save to:

  TopLevelShell viewSaveShell
	   Form viewSaveForm
			Label viewSaveLabel
			AsciiText viewSaveLabelText
			XfwfFileChooser fileChooser
			Label viewSaveTextLabel
			AsciiText viewSaveText
			Command viewSaveOkButton, viewSaveCancelButton

  The <EM>viewSaveLabelText</EM> indicates the name  of  the  temporary
  file  from  which  the  save  should  be  made and connot be
  changed. The <EM>fileChooser</EM> and <EM>fileText</EM> allow  you  to  select
  the file to save to.

<STRONG>Help</STRONG> <STRONG>Panel</STRONG> <STRONG>Widgets</STRONG>
  The "Help" button in Xarchie's top pane  pops  up  the  Help
  panel, which has the following widget hierarchy:

  TopLevelShell  helpShell
	   Form  helpForm
			Label  helpLabel
			Viewport  helpViewport
			List  helpList
			Text  helpText
			Command  helpDoneButton
			Command  helpPrevButton
			Command  helpNextButton
			Command  helpDownButton
			Command  helpUpButton

  The  <EM>helpLabel</EM>  identifies  the  version  of  Xarchie.   The
  <EM>helpList</EM>  displays  the  help  topics, and the corresponding
  text is  displayed  in  the  <EM>helpText</EM>.   The  <EM>helpDoneButton</EM>
  invokes  the  <STRONG>help-done()</STRONG> action, the <EM>helpPrevButton</EM> invokes
  the <STRONG>help-prev()</STRONG> action, and the <EM>helpNextButton</EM>  invokes  the
  <STRONG>help-next()</STRONG>  action.  The  <EM>helpDownButton</EM>  and  <EM>helpUpButton</EM>
  invoke the <STRONG>help-down()</STRONG> and <STRONG>help-up()</STRONG> actions respectively.

<STRONG>About</STRONG> <STRONG>Panel</STRONG> <STRONG>Widgets</STRONG>
  Selecting the "About" item on the  File  menu  pops  up  the
  About panel, which has the following widget hierarchy:

  TopLevelShell aboutShell
	   Form aboutForm
			Label aboutLabel{0,1,2,3,4,5}
			Command aboutDoneButton

  The labels are set to display the  version  of  Xarchie  and
  other contact information. There is little you can or should
  do with these widgets.

<STRONG>Popup</STRONG> <STRONG>Widgets</STRONG>
  Finally, two types of popup windows can appear. An Alert box
  signals  an error and blocks until clicked in; a Confirm box
  allows the user to make a Yes/No decision.  These  have  the
  following widget hierarchies:

  TransientShell alertShell
	   Dialog alertDialog
			Command okButton

  TransientShell confirmShell
	   Dialog confirmDialog
			Command yesButton,noButton

  respectively. Several actions are defined  (see  below)  for
  use in these popups.

<STRONG>Menus</STRONG>
  The MenuButton widgets on both the main Xarchie display  and
  on   the  various  panels  use  standard  Athena  SimpleMenu
  widgets. The following naming conventions are used to  allow
  resources  to  be specified: if the parent SimpleMenu widget
  is named "<EM>foo</EM>Menu", then the  SmeBSBObjects  making  up  the
  entries  are  named  "<EM>foo</EM>MenuItem<STRONG>n</STRONG>", where <STRONG>n</STRONG> starts at 0 for
  the first item in the menu. The menus are  all  children  of
  the  main  Xarchie  shell,  <EM>toplevel</EM>.  For example, the File
  menu has widget hierarchy

  SimpleMenu  fileMenu
	   SmeBSB  menuLabel
			SmeBSB  fileMenuItem{0,1,2,3,4,5,6}


  There are three things worth  mentioning.  First,  as  noted
  above,  the  <EM>settingsMenu</EM>  uses special translations and the
  <STRONG>settings-submenu()</STRONG>  action  to  allow  pullright   submenus.
  Secondly,  the  submenus  available  from  the Settings menu
  (<EM>searchMenu</EM>, <EM>sortMenu</EM>, <EM>niceMenu</EM>,  and  <EM>hostMenu)</EM>  and  those
  available on the Settings Panel (<EM>setSearchMenu</EM>, <EM>setSortMenu</EM>,
  <EM>setNiceMenu</EM>, and <EM>setHostMenu)</EM> have the same labels  but  are
  different  widgets  with  different  effects.   The Settings
  Panel menus (the second  group)  only  update  the  Settings
  panel,  requiring  the  Done  button  to  be clicked to take
  effect. The Settings menu submenus (the  first  group)  take
  effect  immediately,  and  also indicate the current item in
  the left margin of the menu.

  Finally, the number, order, and  effect  of  all  menus  are
  hardcoded, although the labels can, of course, be changed in
  the resource file.  However, changing the  labels  will  NOT
  change  the effect of selecting the item, with the exception
  of the  <EM>hostMenu</EM>  and  <EM>setHostMenu</EM>.   These  menus  use  the
  <EM>numHosts</EM>  non-widget resource to indicate how many items are
  on the menu. Thus you can add hosts to the  menu  by  adding
  <EM>label</EM>  resources  for  the new <EM>hostMenuItem</EM>'s and increasing
  the value of <EM>Xarchie.numHosts</EM>.  Xarchie parses the labels to
  determine   the   hostname:   anything   up   to  whitespace
  constitutes  the  hostname  (and  optional   port   number),
  anything after is simply commentary.

<STRONG>Translation</STRONG> <STRONG>Actions</STRONG>
  The following action procedures are registered  for  Xarchie
  and  can  be  bound  to widget events using the <STRONG>translations</STRONG>
  resource (see the Xt manual, Appendix C). The actions of the
  browser  widgets  are hard-coded since they are so essential
  to  correct  behaviour.   They  can  however  be  bound   to
  different  events  using  the  <STRONG>notify()</STRONG> action (that is, you
  could notify on some other event than mouse clicks,  if  you
  know what you're doing).

<STRONG>Main</STRONG> <STRONG>panel</STRONG> <STRONG>actions</STRONG>
  <STRONG>quit()</STRONG>
	   Exit Xarchie.  By default this is invoked by  selecting
	   "Quit"  from the File menu or by typing "Meta-Q" in any
	   non-Text widget.

  <STRONG>query()</STRONG>
	   Send the current contents of  the  "Search  Term"  text
	   widget  (<EM>searchText)</EM>  to  <EM>Archie</EM>.   By  default this is
	   performed  by  hitting  Return  in  <EM>searchText</EM>  or   by
	   selecting "Query Item" from the Query menu.

  <STRONG>query-host()</STRONG>
	   Fills  the  browser  with  the  contents  of  the  root
	   directory  of  the  host  given  by the contents of the
	   "Host" text widget  (<EM>hostText)</EM>.   By  default  this  is
	   performed  by  hitting  Return  in  <EM>hostText</EM>  or  by by
	   selecting "Query Host" from the Query menu.

  <STRONG>query-location()</STRONG>
	   Fills the browser with the contents  of  the  directory
	   given  by the "Location" text widget (<EM>locationText)</EM> and
	   the host given by  the  contents  of  the  "Host"  text
	   widget  (<EM>hostText)</EM>.   By  default  this is performed by
	   hitting Return in <EM>locationText</EM> or by  selecting  "Query
	   Location" from the Query menu.

  <STRONG>abort()</STRONG>
	   Aborts the current query at the soonest possible  time.
	   Has  no  effect  is  a  query  is  not  currently being
	   processed. By default, this invoked by clicking on  the
	   Abort button when it is active.

  <STRONG>query-or-abort()</STRONG>
	   Invokes either <STRONG>query()</STRONG> or <STRONG>abort()</STRONG>, depending on whether
	   a query is in progress.

  <STRONG>about()</STRONG>
	   Pops up the About panel.

  <STRONG>ftp-get()</STRONG>
	   Begin retrieval of  the  currently-selected  files.  By
	   default  this  is  invoked  by selecting "Get" from the
	   "File" menu, or by  typing  "Meta-G"  in  any  non-Text
	   widget.

<STRONG>Browser</STRONG> <STRONG>actions</STRONG>
  Items are selected in  the  browser  using  the  Left  mouse
  button,  as usual.  Clicking with Shift does not clear other
  selections,   allowing   multiple   selections.   This    is
  implemented  using  the  XfwfMultiList  translation  actions
  <STRONG>Notify()</STRONG>,  <STRONG>Set()</STRONG>,  <STRONG>Toggle()</STRONG>,  and  <STRONG>OpenMany()</STRONG>,  unless  your
  version of Xarchie was compiled to not use the XfwfMultiList
  widget (see the Imakefile or your local installer).   Modify
  at your own risk!

  The following actions are used for other browser operations.

  <STRONG>browser-up()</STRONG>
	   Shifts the browser left (i.e., up the  file  hierarchy)
	   if possible.  By default this is invoked by clicking on
	   the "&lt;&lt;<" button (<EM>browserUpButton)</EM>, or by clicking  the
	   Middle  mouse  button in the browser, or by hitting the
	   "Left" key (often the left arrow on the cursor keypad).

  <STRONG>browser-down()</STRONG>
	   Shifts the browser right (ie., down the file hierarchy)
	   if possible.  By default this is invoked by clicking on
	   the "&gt;&gt;>" button (<EM>browserDownButton)</EM>,  or  by  clicking
	   the  Right  mouse  button in the browser, or by hitting
	   the "Right" key (often the right arrow  on  the  cursor
	   keypad).

  <STRONG>browser-top()</STRONG>
	   Shifts the browser to its leftmost position (i.e.,  the
	   top of the file hierarchy).  By default this is invoked
	   by  clicking   with   Shift   on   the   "&lt;&lt;<"   button
	   (<EM>browserUpButton)</EM> or by hitting the "Home" key.

  <STRONG>browser-open-directories()</STRONG>
	   Expands  selected  directories.  If  the  browser   was
	   expanded  uniquely and successfully, it will be shifted
	   right to display the new information.  By default, this
	   is invoked by double-clicking in the browser.

  <STRONG>browser-open-files()</STRONG>
	   Retrieves selected files by FTP into a  temporary  file
	   and displays them using View windows.

  <STRONG>browser-open-all()</STRONG>
	   Opens  the  selected  items   by   expanding   selected
	   directories  and retrieving selected files for viewing.
	   By default, this is invoked by  selecting  "Open"  from
	   the  File  menu,  or by typing "Meta-O" in any non-text
	   widget.

<STRONG>Settings</STRONG> <STRONG>actions</STRONG>
  The following actions control the Settings Panel and can  be
  used to change some settings without using the panel.

  <STRONG>popup-settings()</STRONG>
	   Pops up the Settings Panel, and resets  its  values  to
	   those currently in effect. Raises the Settings Panel if
	   it is already popped up. By default this  is  performed
	   by selecting "Other" on the Settings menu.

  <STRONG>settings-apply()</STRONG>
	   Sets the  current  settings  from  the  values  on  the
	   Settings  Panel.   By  default  this  is  performed  by
	   clicking the "Apply" button on the Settings Panel.

  <STRONG>settings-default()</STRONG>
	   Resets the values on the Settings Panel to the  default
	   settings,  but  does  not  affect  the current settings
	   until  the  <STRONG>settings-apply()</STRONG>  action  is  invoked.   By
	   default,  this  is invoked by clicking on the "Default"
	   button on the Settings Panel.

  <STRONG>settings-done()</STRONG>
	   Pops down the Settings Panel. If there are changes that
	   have  not  be  applied, then a popup confirm box allows
	   the user to discard the settings or go back  and  apply
	   them.   By  default, this is invoked by clicking on the
	   "Done" button on the Settings Panel.

  <STRONG>set-host(</STRONG>hostname<STRONG>)</STRONG>
	   This action sets the <EM>Archie</EM> host as  indicated  on  the
	   Settings   Panel,  but  does  not  affect  the  current
	   settings until the <STRONG>settings-apply()</STRONG> action is invoked.

  <STRONG>set-host-now(</STRONG>hostname<STRONG>)</STRONG>
	   Sets the <EM>Archie</EM> host immediately  without  waiting  for
	   <STRONG>settings-apply()</STRONG>.

  <STRONG>set-search-type(</STRONG>type<STRONG>)</STRONG>
	   This action sets the searchType  as  indicated  on  the
	   Settings   Panel,  but  does  not  affect  the  current
	   settings until the <STRONG>settings-apply()</STRONG> action is invoked.

  <STRONG>set-search-type-now(</STRONG>type<STRONG>)</STRONG>
	   Sets the searchType  immediately  without  waiting  for
	   <STRONG>settings-apply()</STRONG>.

  <STRONG>set-sort-type(</STRONG>type<STRONG>)</STRONG>
	   This action sets  the  sortType  as  indicated  on  the
	   Settings   Panel,  but  does  not  affect  the  current
	   settings until the <STRONG>settings-apply()</STRONG> action is invoked.

  <STRONG>set-sort-type-now(</STRONG>type<STRONG>)</STRONG>
	   Sets  the  sortType  immediately  without  waiting  for
	   <STRONG>settings-apply()</STRONG>.

  <STRONG>set-nice-level(</STRONG>level<STRONG>)</STRONG>
	   This action sets the  niceLevel  as  indicated  on  the
	   Settings   Panel,  but  does  not  affect  the  current
	   settings until the <STRONG>settings-apply()</STRONG> action is invoked.

  <STRONG>set-nice-level-now(</STRONG>level<STRONG>)</STRONG>
	   Sets the  niceLevel  immediately  without  waiting  for
	   <STRONG>settings-apply()</STRONG>.

  <STRONG>settings-submenu()</STRONG>
	   This action  procedure  is  documented  here  only  for
	   completeness.  It  should  only  be  used for BtnMotion
	   events in  the  <EM>settingsMenu</EM>  widget.  It  invokes  the
	   appropriate  pullright  menu  for  the  Settings  menu.
	   Believe me, you don't want to deal with this.

<STRONG>File</STRONG> <STRONG>actions</STRONG>
  The operation of the File panel is hard-coded. The following
  actions are used to pop it up however:

  <STRONG>file-save()</STRONG>
	   Pops up the  File  panel,  and  resets  its  values  in
	   preparation for saving the database. By default this is
	   invoked by selecting "Save" from the "File" menu or  by
	   typing "Meta-S" in any non-Text widget.

  <STRONG>file-load()</STRONG>
	   Pops up the  File  panel,  and  resets  its  values  in
	   preparation for reloading the database. By default this
	   is invoked by selecting "Load" from the "File" menu  or
	   by typing "Meta-L" in any non-Text widget.

  <STRONG>file-write()</STRONG>
	   Pops up the  File  panel,  and  resets  its  values  in
	   preparation  for  writing  the  database  in  a  human-
	   readable form. By default this is invoked by  selecting
	   "Write"  from  the "File" menu or by typing "Meta-W" in
	   any non-Text widget.

<STRONG>Help</STRONG> <STRONG>actions</STRONG>
  <STRONG>help()</STRONG>
	   Pops up the Help panel.

  <STRONG>help-done()</STRONG>
	   Dismisses the Help panel.

  <STRONG>help-prev()</STRONG>
  <STRONG>help-next()</STRONG>
	   Selects the previous or next help topic, respectively.

  <STRONG>help-up()</STRONG>
  <STRONG>help-down()</STRONG>
	   Scrolls the text of the current help topic up  or  down
	   one  page,  respectively.   This  is  an alternative to
	   using the Text widget's scrollbar.

<STRONG>Miscellaneous</STRONG> <STRONG>actions</STRONG>
  <STRONG>ftp-trace-done()</STRONG>
	   Dismisses the FTP Trace window.  By  default,  this  is
	   invoked  by clicking on the "Dismiss" button in the FTP
	   Trace window.

<STRONG>Environment</STRONG> <STRONG>Variables</STRONG>
  The following environment variables are used by  Xarchie  if
  they are defined:

  TMPDIR         - Directory for "Open"-ed files
  XAPPLRESDIR    - Directory containing Xarchie resource file
  USER           - Username for FTP mail address
  HOSTNAME       - Hostname for FTP mail address

<STRONG>Files</STRONG>
  Xarchie        - default Xarchie resource file

<STRONG>Diagnostics</STRONG>
  Xarchie indicates X errors using the ever-popular default  X
  error  handler  that  prints  a  message  and dies, possibly
  leaving a large core dump somewhere.

  Errors due to incorrect  resource  specifications  cause  an
  error message on stderr, but do not kill Xarchie (usually).

  Errors due to incorrect user commands or problems  with  the
  connection  to  Archie  result  in  a  popup alert box being
  displayed. Clicking on the indicated button in the alert box
  will make it go away and allow you to continue.

  An incorrect value for the FTP mail address  (as  determined
  from  the  system  information or from the USER and HOSTNAME
  variables)  can  result  in  access  being  denied  by  some
  anonymous   FTP   servers.   See   the  description  of  the
  <STRONG>ftpMailAddress</STRONG>  non-widget  resource  if  your  system   has
  problems with this.

  If you continually get "Can't resolve hostname" errors  when
  you  try  to  query,  then  Xarchie  was not built properly.
  Contact your local maintainer and suggest that they read the
  PROBLEMS file concerning the "resolv" library.
  If  your  queries  always  time  out,  then  there  are  two
  possibilities.   First,  and by far the most likely, is that
  the server is simply  busy.   Try  again  later.  The  other
  possibility  is that UDP traffic is disabled on your system.
  You should contact your local maintainer  and  ask  them  to
  read the PROBLEMS files concerning UDP traffic.

<STRONG>Known</STRONG> <STRONG>Bugs</STRONG>
  Crashes have been observed when the Help text  is  scrolled.
  There  is  no  fix,  but  see  the  PROBLEMS  file  for some
  discussion.

  The list of files in the FileChooser widgets don't  seem  to
  get  displayed  properly  all  the  time. That is, sometimes
  items seem to be drawn on top of each other. Refreshing  the
  window  (eg., iconify/deiconify or scrolling up/down) clears
  it up. This seems like an  Xaw  bug,  but  is  difficult  to
  repeat in isolation.

  Your mileage may vary regarding the Xarchie icon changing to
  reflect  search and transfer status. Your window manager may
  not support application-specified icons, or may not  support
  them  changing  dynamically.  See the PROBLEMS file for some
  discussion.

  It is not currently  possible  to  abort  during  nameserver
  lookup.    Perhaps  some  day  I'll  get  motivated  to  add
  asynchronous DNS code.

  The browser has a hard-coded maximum depth, beyond which you
  cannot  expand directories. I don't think it will be a major
  problem however.

<STRONG>Reporting</STRONG> <STRONG>Bugs</STRONG>
  If you have problems with or questions about  an  individual
  Archie  server  site,  contact archie-admin at that site. If
  you  have  any  questions  about  Archie  itself,  write  to
  info@bunyip.com. If you have questions about Prospero, write
  to    info-prospero@isi.edu.    The     USENET     newsgroup
  comp.archives.admin may also be helpful.

  If you have a problem, please read the "Known Bugs"  section
  first,  then  contact  your local maintainer and/or refer to
  the PROBLEMS and INSTALL files in the Xarchie distribution.

  When reporting bugs, problems, suggestions or contributions,
  please  be  sure  to  send  them  to the right place. Issues
  dealing with the  X  interface  should  be  sent  to  George
  Ferguson  (ferguson@cs.rochester.edu).  Please  be  sure  to
  include  sufficient   details,   including   hardware,   OS,
  compiler,  version  of X, and the like.  No amount of detail
  is too much.
  Brendan Kehoe  (brendan@cygnus.com)  is  in  charge  of  the
