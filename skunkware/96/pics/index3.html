SCO Skunkware 96 includes a variety of images which you might find
useful as backgrounds for your HTML documents. Browse the
<A HREF="gif">GIF</A> and <A HREF="jpg">JPEG</A> images and select
those that suit your taste and style. In order to utilize one of these
as a backgound in an HTML document, insert a line similar to the following
just after the HEAD section near the beginning of your document :
<PRE>
&lt;BODY BACKGROUND="/skunkware/pics/jpg/water2.jpg" BGCOLOR="#0000FF" 
LINK="#8fbc8f" TEXT="#ffffff" VLINK="#adeaea"&gt;
</PRE>
after placing the file <A HREF="jpg/7m.jpg">7m.jpg</A> in a directory called
"jpg" directly beneath your HTTP server's document root. Perhaps you don't
like these settings or this background. Maybe you'll like
<A HREF="index.html">this one</A> better. Or
<A HREF="index2.html">this one</A> . Or
<A HREF="index4.html">this one</A> .
Or maybe you'll just have to
follow <A HREF="http://rockhall.com/induct/nelsrick.html">Ricky Nelson's</A> 
advice when he said "You can't please everyone, so you gotta please yourself".
<P>
Note the use of hexadecimal values for setting the colors of links, text,
visited links and the default background color (in case the background
image is not available for some reason). These settings should be chosen
so as to provide some contrast while remaining compatible with the background
and pleasing to the eye. Some experimentation may be necessary. Assistance
with setting these hexadecimal values is available via
<A HREF="http://www.infi.net/wwwimages/colorindex.html">
http://www.infi.net/wwwimages/colorindex.html</A> and a variety of additional
backgrounds can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.netcreations.com/patternland/">
http://www.netcreations.com/patternland/</A> as well as 
<A HREF="http://www.sco.com/SkunkWare/rr/browsers.html">
many other sites</A> around the web.
<P>
Perhaps you don't want to incur the overhead of loading a potentially
large image as a background but you'd still like to display your page
with some colors. This is possible by using a BODY tag similar to the
one above but without the BACKGROUND attribute. For instance, a
light blue background can be achieved with the line :
<PRE>
&lt;BODY BGCOLOR=#438BAE TEXT=#000000 VLINK=#650065
LINK=#00007A ALINK=#00FF00&gt;
</PRE>
A new midnight blue background :
<PRE>
&lt;BODY BGCOLOR=#00009C LINK=#00FFFF VLINK=#00C8C8
TEXT=#23D8FF ALINK=#00FF00&gt;
</PRE>
A white background :
<PRE>
&lt;BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF TEXT=#000000 LINK=#0000FF
VLINK=#00009C ALINK=#00FF00&gt;
</PRE>
A black background :
<PRE>
&lt;BODY BGCOLOR=#000000  TEXT=#FFFFFF LINK=#0077FF
VLINK=#FF3EE4 ALINK=#00FF00&gt;
</PRE>
And so on.
