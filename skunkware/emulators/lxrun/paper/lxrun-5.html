<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 How do I get lxrun ?</A>
</H2>

<P>Lxrun is currently distributed as a component of <B>SCO Skunkware</B>
<A HREF="http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/">http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/</A>,
a free CD-ROM containing hundreds of megabytes of pre-compiled and pre-packaged 
software for SCO platforms. A Skunkware CD-ROM can be obtained via
<A HREF="http://www.sco.com/offers/">http://www.sco.com/offers/</A> and, beginning in 1998, all operating
systems released by SCO will contain a Skunkware CD-ROM in the shrink-wrapped
product. Lxrun may also be obtained via the SCO Skunkware web site at 
<A HREF="http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/emulators/">http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/emulators/</A>.
All SCO Skunkware software is freely redistributable.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Building lxrun from source</A>
</H2>

<P>Detailed instructions on building lxrun from source, configuring the build, 
installing the emulation system and additional run-time components, installing 
a Linux binary, runtime environment variables, and error messages are contained
in the file <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> in the lxrun source distribution and on-line in
<A HREF="http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/emulators/lxrun/FAQ.html">the lxrun FAQ</A>.
<P>The lxrun source distribution contains a Makefile with support for compilation
on SCO OpenServer 5, UnixWare 2.x, and UnixWare 7. The Makefile uses the
output of "uname -r" to determine the platform. As additional
platform support is added this will need to be augmented or the configuration
modified to use autoconfig.
<P>To build lxrun on one of the supported platforms, it is only necessary to
issue the command "make". The command "make install" will both build lxrun
and copy the resulting binaries and documentation into $(DESTDIR) which
is set by default to the ./dist directory.
<P>As a convenience this distribution includes a script called 
lxfront which can be used with a symbolic link (see below) to provide 
a wrapper around the invocation of lxrun the Linux binary name
allowing them to be run directly.
<P>Starting with lxrun 0.9.0 the build of lxrun will produce an ld-linux.so.1
as well as the lxrun binary. The ld-linux.so.1 is installed in /lib on the
target system and provides support for direct execution of Linux binaries,
thus deprecating the need for the lxrun binary front-end except for the
execution of Linux a.out binaries.
<P>The lxrun source has the following capability ifdefs:
<UL>
<LI><B>DEF_LINUX_ROOT</B> -
Default root directory name for lxrun to searching under for any
native Linux files. 
Specifically when a Linux library tries to load a dynamic library, lxrun
remaps the pathname to somewhere below this directory.  
The value specified here becomes the internal default which can be 
overridden by the LINUX_ROOT environment variable.
Set in Makefile with make macro LXROOT.
Default value is "/usr/local/linux"</LI>
<LI><B>TRACE</B> -
Flag for making a version of lxrun that emits system call traces 
(to file /tmp/lxrun.nnn (where "nnn" is the process pid.))
This can be used for tracing a binaries use of an unimplemented 
system call or other runtime problems. Its not enabled bu default 
since it slows down the operation of lxrun and produces large log files.
(build should be augmented to make a variantly named lxrun binary with this 
on regardless).
Set in Makefile with make macro TRACE.
Default is disabled (off)</LI>
<LI><B>ELF_DEBUG</B> -
Flag to enable output to stderr of debug traces for the 
ELF loader capability of lxrun. Outputs ELF Header information,
interpreter remap values and open, load, mmap, mprotect values/status
(should be modified to be integrated with TRACE logging)
Set in Makefile via make macro DBG.
Default is disabled (off)</LI>
<LI><B>UNIDIRECTIONAL_PIPES</B> -
Flag to enable use of unidirectional pipes (pipe() ) 
instead of bidirectional pipes (socketpair()) for the pipe()
syscall emulation on platforms where pipes are not bidirectional.
Not referenced in Makefile.
Default is disabled (emulation will use bidirectional pipes)</LI>
<LI><B>NO_DISPLAY_HACK</B> -
Flag to disable remapping of DISPLAY variable from a local server 
specification to a full hostname specification.
This remapping is done (by default) to address some 
problems with local connections on OSr5 (at least) to some X servers.
Not referenced in Makefile.
Default is disabled (remapping will be done)</LI>
<LI><B>LXRUN_AUTO_PATH_BEHAVIOR</B> -
if enabled makes lxrun search for the Linux binary to be run in the 
normal PATH rather than in the (expected) absolute pathname given.
Not referenced in Makefile.
Default is disabled (off)</LI>
<LI><B>ELFMARK_HACK</B> -
enables detection of binaries marked (with elfmark) as Linux binaries
(mark value "LXRN" as an unsigned long).
Not referenced in Makefile.
Default is disabled (off) - status is experimental.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Platform defines for OpenServer 5 (OSR5), UnixWare 2.x (UNIXWARE) 
and UnixWare 7 (GEMINI) are automatically setup in the Makefile.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Installing the emulation system</A>
</H2>

<P>Lxrun expects to find all its (Linux) library files in a normal root hierarchy
rooted under a single place called the LINUX_ROOT.
Unless respecified in the build this defaults internally in lxrun to
/usr/local/linux.
<P>You can respecify or change it at runtime with the environment variable
LINUX_ROOT (wherever it ends up this must be the place the Linux 
libraries are placed under).
<P>"make install" will install the built binary (lxrun) into /usr/local/bin,
lxfront into $LINUX_ROOT/bin, and the lxrun program interpreter
ld-linux.so.1 into /lib. The HTML documents describing lxrun are placed
in /usr/local/man/html/lxrun.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Installing Linux applications</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>With lxrun 0.9.0 and later, Linux ELF binaries can be installed anywhere in
the standard execution path (e.g. /usr/local/bin). See section
<A HREF="lxrun-3.html#sec-direct">Direct execution of Linux ELF binaries</A>
for details on how this is done. Further, Linux applications distributed in 
RPM format can be installed using either a native RPM port 
or the Linux RPM run under the control of lxrun. Some additional arguments
to RPM may be necessary. For instance, a native port of RPM for SCO OpenServer 
is available at 
<A HREF="http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/osr5/sysadmin/rpm/">http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/osr5/sysadmin/rpm/</A>).
Using the SCO OpenServer RPM it is necessary to invoke RPM as follows:
<PRE>
    rpm --nodeps --ignorearch --ignoreos --prefix /usr/local ...
</PRE>

The Skunkware distribution of RPM for OpenServer includes a shell script
front-end <CODE>rpm4sco</CODE> which inserts these arguments for you.
<P>Linux a.out and statically linked ELF binaries should be installed in 
/usr/local/linux/bin and symbolic links by the name of the binary created 
from /usr/local/bin to the lxfront shell script in /usr/local/linux/bin.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Error messages</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE>linuxemul: fatal error: program load failed: No such file or directory</CODE>
<P>Indicates that the Linux binary couldn't run 
(either lxrun could't find the Linux binary or the Linux binary 
couldn't find the dynamic linker)
It probably means your LINUX_ROOT environment variable isn't set up 
correctly or you don't have the required minimum Linux libraries.
<P><CODE>progname: can't load library 'some_library_name.so'</CODE>
<P>Indicates you're missing a shared library that is needed to
run a particular binary.  You can either try to find a
compiled version of the library from a Linux ftp site
(such as 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/</A>) or if you
have access to a running Linux system, you can copy the
library directly.  You should put the library in
$LINUX_ROOT/lib on your host system 
(/usr/localLinuxlib by default on a SCO system ).
<P><CODE>myprog: can't resolve symbol '__iob'<BR>
myprog: can't resolve symbol '__iob'<BR>
myprog: can't resolve symbol '__ctype'</CODE>
<P>Indicates that the Linux dynamic loader found a native SCO library
and is using it instead of the corresponding Linux binary.  
(You can find out exactly which library is causing the problem by
examining the lxrun.log file produced by a debugging version of
lxrun.)
<P>This will only occur if you have native libraries
installed that have the same names as a dependent Linux binary.
If you have XFree86 installed, the /usr/X11R6/lib libraries are
common culprits.
<P>The best solution is to make sure no native libraries are
available anywhere under the directory pointed to by
$LINUX_ROOT.

<LI> Go to 
<A HREF="http://skunkware.dev/skunkware">http://skunkware.dev/skunkware</A> and make
sure you have the most recent version of lxrun.  If not,
download the latest one and try it.  We are updating
lxrun with new system calls all the time.
</LI>
<LI> Recompile lxrun with the TRACE option enabled.  (This
requires modifying one line in the Makefile.)  This will
cause lxrun to produce a history of all system calls
used by the binary as it was run (similar to the
"truss" and "trace" commands).  The trace dump will be
created in a file called "/tmp/lxrun.nnn" where "nnn" is
the process id.
</LI>
<LI> Try to narrow down exactly which system call failed.
Most likely, the failure will be due to a system call
that has not yet been implemented in lxrun.
</LI>
<LI> Implement the system call mapping.  This is usually
pretty easy to do.  The vast majority of lxrun's code
does mappings of this sort, so you can pick out almost
any source file to see how it is done.  Chances are, the
system call you need to remap is already in one of the
lxrun source files, but its code looks something like
this:

int lx_flock()          { errno=ENOSYS; return -1; }    

This means that you're the first person who has gotten
around to mapping that particular system call.
</LI>
<LI> After making your modification, recompile lxrun and
see if it works.  You may have to remap more than one
system call to get your binary working!
</LI>
<LI> E-mail your changes to 
<A HREF="mailto:skunkware@ronrecord.com">skunkware@ronrecord.com</A>.
This way, we can put your changes into the next release of lxrun.
</LI>
<LI> If steps 1-5 seem beyond your programming
ability, contact 
<A HREF="mailto:skunkware@ronrecord.com">skunkware@ronrecord.com</A>.
and maybe one of the
Skunkware team will have time to give you a hand with it.
Make sure to tell us exactly what program you're having
trouble with, and if possible, tell us where you got it.</LI>
