This directory contains the SGML source for a technical paper on Lxrun,
an Intel Linux(R) emulator. This paper was submitted for inclusion in the
conference proceedings of the 1998 USENIX Technical Conference in New Orleans.

In addition to the SGML source (lxrun.sgml), you should also find a
Makefile useful in generating a variety of output formats:

	ps/lxrun.ps - Postscript version
	dvi/lxrun.dvi - DVI version
	html/*.html - HTML version
	info/lxrun.info - GNU Info version
	rtf/*.rtf - Microsoft RTF version
	tex/lxrun.tex - TeX (Latex) version
	txt/lxrun.txt - Text version (use a pager like more or pg)

The Makefile can also be used to generate:

	latex2html HTML output (make latex2html)

The Lxrun source is available at ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/src/emulators/
and the Lxrun home page is http://www.sco.com/skunkware/emulators/lxrun/
