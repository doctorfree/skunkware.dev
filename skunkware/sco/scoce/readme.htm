Windows CE to UNIX connectivity Tools 1.0.2
</CENTER>
</FONT

<P>
<P>
This suite of utilities is intended to enhance the functionality
of a Windows CE device, enhance it's Windows compatibility by providing
identical utilities on Windows and Windows CE, and
enhance the UNIX connectivity by providing specific UNIX connectivity
applications.
<P>
The ability for applications to share common files across
Windows and Windows CE is a big win and makes the CE device more useful
as a stand-alone device as it runs exactly like the full blown
windows box when using these applications.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>All applications come with Win9X and WINCE versions so that files can
be shared from the desktop to the handheld without conversion.</LI>
<LI>All application data files are ASCII format for maximum flexibility.</LI>
<LI>Currently SH3 and MIPS WINCE 2.X binaries provided on CE.</LI>
<LI>Tested on HP Jornada 680 and Compaq C2010.</LI>
<LI>Runs on NT/Win 2K, and Win9x.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Applications provided in both Windows and Windows CE versions:
<UL>
<LI>kmail - An IMAP4 mail client, tested with SCO UnixWare 7 and
	SCO OpenServer 5 (which are based on the University of
	Washington's IMAP server).</LI>
<LI>ktel - a telnet program that implements a subset of the spec for scoansi
terminal type compatibility.</LI>
<LI>org - a personal organizer (PIM)</LI>
<LI>check - a simple checkbook program</LI>
<LI>vi - a vi-like editor that is a subset of the real thing.</LI>
<LI>wkl1 - a scripting language interpreter modelled after the C language,
	but is P-Code based with type checking and array bounds checks.
	A compile and go language, KL1 programs are source based scripts,
	but execution is at P-Code speeds, it still lacks graphics,
	just has character mode so far.</LI>
<LI>ksh - a C-Shell-like program written entirely in KL1.  At last
	a command line prompt for your CE box.</LI>
<LI>grep, ext, phone, rg, find, deltree, ktar, ... - some miscelleaneous utilities
    in KL1 to make the command prompt provided by ksh minimally useful and also
    provide some sample programs.</LI>
<LI>diff - a UNIX-like diff utility that also includes recursive directory
	comparison features.</LI>
<LI>kfc - a floating point calculater that is programmable, inspired by
	the HP-41CX (a now defunct model), so it is RPN and loaded with
	scientific functions.  It adds printf to make it a simple calculator-like
	scripting language interpreter.  Like kl1 (above) this is a compile
	and go P-Code interpreter.</LI>
<LI>kftp - a simple ftp program for windows and windows CE.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Windows only programs:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF=kbackup.htm>kbackup - A backup program designed for filesystem
	backup devices such as a JAZ driver or a shared drive on a fileserver.</A>
<LI>setupce - a scripting language that can copy files to and from the HPC.
	This is the program I use for installation and backup purposes.
</UL>
<P>
SCO UNIX Utilities provided (preliminary, in c:\scoce\osr5\scoceosr5.tar.Z).
<UL>
<LI>ktar - compatible with the windows ktar format, supports long filenames.
<LI>kl1 - a scripting language making it possible to write scripts for all three platforms.
<LI>kfc - the RPN floating pt calculator.
<LI>rdiff - remote diff, a program that can sum a directory and compare two
directory sum files.
<LI>ldiff - like rdiff but compares two directories and generates diff listings
for ASCII files that are different, all in one command invocation.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Installation instructions:</B>
<P>
<LI>For Win9X just run the self extracting exe file, it will install into c:\scoce.</LI>
<LI>For WINCE</LI>
<UL>
<LI>You must install the HPX explorer first before you can install to the HPC.</LI>
<LI>I recommend you first configure your HPC and HPC browser to
communicate at the maximum speed of 115k rather than the default
of 19.2k.  On the HPC use the control panel communications item and
change the speed to 115k.  On the PC right click on the My Computer icon,
select properties, then select the device manager tab, expand the modem
are (click on the plus sign), select the Serial cable on com1 item,
select properties, then click on the modem tab, and modify the maximum
speed setting to 115200.  I believe that you should restart your windows
PC now or the connection may fail as the old speed may still be in effect.
<LI>Start the WINCE browser and connect to the HPC (using the link cable).</LI>
<LI>Run the "Install/Uninstall HPC" menu item under the start/programs/scoce menu.</LI>
<LI>Disconnect and turn off and turn back on your HPC for the changes to take effect.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>The Lucida Console font is an old Microsoft
font from the win31 days. It is the clearest true type font for fixed
width characters in really small sizes I have ever found.  I
provide it here for your use.  I think technically you need a windows
license to use it, but then you need one anyway to use any of these
products so I don't think it is a problem.  The font predates the Euro
symbol however so that symbol is incorrect.
<UL>
<LI>The Lucida Console Font is automatically installed in Windows 9x and Windows CE.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Removal instructions:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Windows CE is removed by re-running the install program from windows 9X<BR>
It will detect that the utilities are installed and ask if you want to
remove them.</LI>
<LI>Windows 9X utilities are removed via the Remove button in the start
menu under the scoce menu.<BR>
Alternatively rerunning the self extracting exe file
will also uninstall the scoce utilities if it detects they are present.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Documentation (help).</B>
<UL>
<LI>Full HTML based help is installed and is available in the start menu under
the scoce entry for both Win9X and WinCE.
</UL>

Feedback Welcome.

<P>
Changes since the last release:
	Installation upgraded to use pkzip for windows, it is now a single
		step binary to execute to install or uninstall.
	Setupce program now provided for general purpose use such as
		backing up the HPC.
	MIPS CPU Support added, CPU type autodetected during HPC install.
	Minor bug fixes and enhancements.
	kftp (an ftp program) has been added (win 9x and WINCE supported).
	It installs on NT4.0 and win2k.
