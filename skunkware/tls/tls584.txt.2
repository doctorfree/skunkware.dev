SCO Host Resources MIB Support

SCO OpenServer Release 5 includes support for the Host Resources
MIB.  This is an SNMP MIB, based on IETF RFC1514.  This document
describes what information is provided by SCO OpenServer Release
5 for each MIB entry.

The Host Resources MIB defines a uniform set of objects useful
for the management of host computers.  Host computers are
independent of the operating system, network services, or any
software applications.

The Host Resources MIB defines objects which are common across
many computer system architectures.

In addition, there are objects in the MIB-II which also provide
host management functionality.  Implementation of the System and
Interfaces groups is mandatory for implementors of the Host
Resources MIB.  Implementations of the Host Resources MIB makes
SCO systems manageable by SNMP management stations.

The following sections list the definitions included in the HR
MIB.  The attributes are read-only unless noted otherwise.


The Host Resources System Group

   hrSystemUptime - implemented 
   hrSystemDate - implemented - attribute is writeable 
   hrSystemInitialLoadDevice - implemented - attribute is writeable,
           but changes are not stored. Subsequent access will reset the value 
   hrSystemInitialLoadParameters - implemented - attribute is writeable,
           but changes are not stored. Subsequent access will reset the values 
   hrSystemNumUsers - implemented 
   hrSystemProcesses - implemented 
   hrSystemMaxProcesses - returns zero, as there is no fixed maximum 



The Host Resources Storage Group

   hrMemorySize - implemented 
   hrStorageTable -implemented - includes streams buffers, swap areas,
                                 and filesystems 
      hrStorageEntry 
         hrStorageIndex - implemented 
         hrStorageType - implemented 
         hrStorageDescr - implemented 
         hrStorageAllocationUnits - implemented - filesystems and swap space
                   have fixed-size allocation units (1K blocks),
                   Streams buffers vary in size 
         hrStorageSize - implemented 
         hrStorageUsed - implemented 
         hrStorageAllocationFailures - implemented for streams buffers only.
             Other storage types always return zero 



The Host Resources Device Group

   hrDeviceTable -implemented - includes hard disks, floppy disks, CD-ROMs,
              tape drives, mice and other pointing devices, video displays,
               printers, networks, and processors 
      hrDeviceEntry 
         hrDeviceIndex - implemented 
         hrDevicetype - implemented 
         hrDeviceDescr - implemented 
         hrDeviceID - returns 0.0 which means unknown 
         hrDeviceStatus - varies for device type. Returns unknown in most cases.
                   Returns running or down for processors. Returns down if a
                   printer is not enabled. 
         hrDeviceErrors - returns zero for all devices 
         hrProcessorTable - this is potentially sparse, an entry only
                  exists if the correspondent value of the hrDeviceType
                  object is 'hrDeviceProcessor' 
   hrProcessorTable 
      hrProcessorEntry 
         hrProcessorFrwID - returns 0.0 which means unknown 
         hrProcessorLoad - implemented - it is implemented in such a way
             that it shows the average over the last 20 minutes, not
             the last 1 minute. Correct this by having cron(C) run
             sadc(ADM) every minute. 
   hrNetwork Table 
      hrNetworkEntry 
         hrNetworkIfIndex - implemented 
   hrPrinterTable 
      hrPrinterEntry 
         hrPrinterStatus - returns unknown 
         hrPrinterDetectedErrorState - If the printer is enabled and
                  accepting jobs, this attribute returns 0; otherwise
                  it returns 2 (bit 6 --off-line) 
   hrDiskStorageTable 
      hrDiskStorageEntry 
         hrDiskStorageAccess - implemented 
         hrDiskStorageMedia - implemented 
         hrDiskStorageRemovable - implemented 
         hrDiskStorageCapacity - implemented 
   hrPartitionTable 
      hrPartitionEntry 
         hrPartitionIndex - implemented 
         hrPartitionLabel - implemented 
         hrPartitionID - implemented 
         hrPartitionSize - implemented 
         hrPartitionFSIndex - implemented 



The File System Table

   hrFSTable 
      hrFSEntry 
         hrFSIndex - implemented 
         hrFSMountPoint -implemented 
         hrFSRemoteMountPoint - implemented 
         hrFSType -implemented 
         hrFSAccess -implemented 
         hrFSBootable - implemented 
         hrFSStorageIndex - implemented 
         hrFSLastFullBackupDate - returns unknown 
         hrFSLastPartialBackupDate - returns unknown
