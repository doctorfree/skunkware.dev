SCO Online Support - Technical Library Supplements

As you know, the SCO Online Support system provides various
support and educational materials for interactive access via WWW
browsers, our BBS systems, anonymous uucp and ftp.  
These facilities are provided at ftp.sco.com, www.sco.com, and
ftp.uu.net in North America (a few exceptions noted below). 
In addition, many of the supplementary files are provided in the
LIBraries of the SCOFORUM on Compuserve.

Europeans may find the mirror site in England more acccessible:
src.doc.ic.ac.uk[146.169.3.7]:/unix/sco-archive

At the SCO sites, the directories online are:

   SLS - SCO Support Level Supplements (fixits, updates, etc.)
   EFS - Extended Feature Supplements (improved product components)
   Supplements - SCO product maintenance supplements
   Term - updated termcap and terminfo files
   HCH - Hardware Compatibility Handbook

   Games - Games and entertainment - unsupported
   Skunk - SCO Skunkware cdrom files (approximately) - unsupported
           note: This is only on www.sco.com
   TLS - SCO Technical Library Supplements, unsupported

Each of these directories has a README or "info" file that describes
the material therein, and they are fairly self explanatory. 


This README describes the Technical Library Supplements.

The files in TLS are offered for experimental or educational use.  They
are provided "as-is" to knowledgeable users as a courtesy.  The TLSs
are NOT supported by SCO Support department.   Please do not contact
the friendly folks in the Support department about these files; rather,
direct your comments to the original authors (where named), or to me.

In some cases, these are components or updates to existing SCO
Software.  Some of the programs here may be compiled or derived
from freely available copyrighted sources.  Other material may be
educational or supplementary documentation.  All use of this
material is the sole responsibility of the user, and you MUST
observe the copyright and licensing restrictions that are
provided in the cover letters, documentation, and code.

We do not intend this to be yet another archive of freely
available software that has been compiled for SCO.  That function
is well served by other archive sites (thanks!).  The material
here is primarily that which SCO uniquely can provide, or which
is not readily available elsewhere.  For other archive sites,
consult the periodically posted list of SCO-related ftp sites in
one of the SCO-related Usenet newsgroups or on Compuserve SCOFORUM.

Usually, you will need a licensed SCO operating system to use
these files, and any SCO-owned code here is provided to you under
the terms of your SCO software license(s).  You will also need a
good understanding of how to use the SCO system, and a certain
amount of daredevil, thrillseeking enjoyment of interesting and
colorful results.

The available supplements are listed below.

These files can be downloaded interactively from the SCO Online
Support BBS.  Follow the menus in the "software toolchest"
selection.  We support kermit, Xmodem, Ymodem and Zmodem.

These files are also accessible via anonymous uucp (see below), and
by anonymous ftp, and of course with a suitably configured Internet web
browser.

The TLS files are also available as one of many goodies
on the SCO Skunkware CD-ROM.  This promotional CD-ROM is
available at various times and places; contact your SCO supplier
for more info on Skunkware (or join the SCO Developer Alliance).

On Compuserve, just enter "go scoforum" and follow instructions for
your CIS interface, whichever one you use.


Generally, we name the TLS distribution files like this:
  
       tlsxxx.1   = binary floppy image, volume 1
       tlsxxx.1.Z = same thing, but compressed
       tlsxxx.ltr = cover letter, ascii file - install info, etc.
       tlsxxx.c   = source code file
       tlsxxx.doc.Z = documentation and other propaganda
       tlsxxx.tar.Z = tar archive file, compressed.
       tlsxxx.tar*  = tar archive file                 
       tlsxxx.ps    = postscript file
       <something else> = miscellaneous documentation, etc.
       tls5xx.*     = TLS targetting SCO OpenServer Release 5
  
Files ending in .Z have been reduced in size by the compress
utility.  The compress and uncompress utilities are included with
SCO XENIX releases 2.3.0 and later, SCO UNIX, and SCO Open
Desktop.  In some cases, we have compressed using the -H option
(LZH algorithm).  Your version of compress in SCO UNIX version
4.0 or later understands this.  If you have an older compress
utility, you may need to download the newer version of compress
in tls031.

Note also that you can get sosco to do the uncompress for you if
you use ftp and refer to the file name without the final ".Z" For
example, to receive an uncompressed copy of tls042.1.Z, enter get
tls042.1 and ftp will uncompress before transmission.  Of course
you want to avoid this if possible, since the uncompressed file
takes longer to transmit.

We do not compress all floppy images.  Some SCO distributions
have files that are already compressed and to compress again is
counterproductive.  Some TLS files may just be tar files, not floppy
images.  In some cases the uucp g protocol may raise alarms when used
with certain modems that perform data compression.  If you get
uucp alarms, try turning off data compression in your modem, if it is
used.

There are a few gaps in the numbering, due to TLSs not yet ready,
withdrawn, and other assorted reasons.  Also, you may see some
numbers "reserved" for future additions.

Anyone is welcome to redistribute this notice to other newsgroups or
customers.  If you have comments about these distributions, feel free to
contact me.  E-mail _strongly_ preferred.  In some cases, authors have
provided their names and indicated willingness to correspond about the
TLSs.   Check the cover letters for author info.
