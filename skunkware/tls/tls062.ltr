Subj: tls062 - automatic debugger launching

This is the code associated with the article on "Automatic Debugger
Launching" in the November 1994 issue of Unix Review.  To try
it, just type make.  To use the feature in your programs, just
add adbl.o to your link line.

To try the "named core" facility, cd to the named-core directory
and type make.
