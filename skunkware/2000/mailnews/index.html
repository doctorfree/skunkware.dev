<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Fetchmail is a full-featured IMAP/POP2/POP3/APOP/RPOP/KPOP client with easy
        configuration, daemon mode, forwarding via SMTP or local MDA,
        superior reply handling, support for multidrop mailboxes.
        Not a mail user agent, rather a pipe-fitting that seamlessly
        forwards fetched mail to your local delivery system.
        Your one-stop solution for intermittent email connections.
        This is the replacement for the old popclient program.

<P>
Hypermail converts a file of mail messages in UNIX mailbox format into a 
set of cross-referenced HTML files containing links to other messages in 
the archive and to e-mail addresses within the messages. The archives are 
updatable, so you can perform incremental updates instead of rebuilding new 
archives from your mail files. Hypermail was originally developed and designed 
by Tom Gruber in Common Lisp, and was later rewritten in C by Kevin Hughes.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Majordomo is a program which automates the management of Internet mailing lists.
Commands are sent to Majordomo via electronic mail to handle all aspects of 
list maintainance. Once a list is set up, virtually all operations can be 
performed remotely, requiring no intervention upon the postmaster of
the list site. 
</P>
<P>
Majordomo controls a list of addresses for some mail transport system (like 
sendmail or smail) to handle. Majordomo itself performs no mail delivery 
(though it has scripts to format and archive messages).

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
InterNetNews is a complete Usenet system.  The cornerstone of the package
is innd, an NNTP server that multiplexes all I/O.  Think of it as an nntpd
merged with the B News inews, or as a C News relaynews that reads multiple
NNTP streams.  Newsreading is handled by a separate server, nnrpd, that is
spawned for each client.  Both innd and nnrpd have some slight variances
from the NNTP protocol (although in normal use you will never notice); see
the manpages.  INN separates hosts that feed you news from those that have
users reading news.  If you need to support a mixed environment you will have
to do some extra work; the installation manual gives some hints.
<P>
This is the public release of version 2.0 of InterNet News. This
work is sponsored by the Internet Software Consortium.
</P>
<P>
<B>Note:</B> The installation of the INN package creates a user "news"
and group "news".

<H4><A NAME="mutt"></A>Mutt - text-based mail client</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based mail client for Unix operating
systems.  Some of its features include:

<ul>
<li>color support
<li>message threading
<li>MIME support (including RFC2047 support for encoded headers)
<li>POP3 support
<li>support for multiple mailbox formats (mbox, MMDF, MH, maildir)
<li>highly customizable, including key bindings
<li>searches using regular expression
<li>Delivery Status Notification (DSN) support
<li>PGP/MIME (RFC2015)
<li>postpone message composition for later recall
<li>include attachments from the command line when composing
<li>reply to or forward multiple messages at once
<li><i>.mailrc</i> style configuration files
<li>easy to install (uses GNU autoconf)
<li>small and efficient
<li><i>It's freeware!</i>
</ul>

Though written from scratch, Mutt's initial interface was based largely on
the <a href="http://www.myxa.com/elm/">ELM</a> mail client.  To a large
extent, Mutt is still very ELM-like in presentation of information in menus
(and in fact, ELM users will find it quite painless to switch as the
default key bindings are identical).  As development progressed,
features found in other popular clients such as PINE and MUSH have been
added, the result being a hybrid, or ``mutt.'' At present, it most closely
resembles the <a href="http://space.mit.edu/~davis/slrn.html">SLRN</a> news
client.

                     yet.
______________________________________________________________________________


INTRODUCTION:

Spam (aka UCE: Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail) is the Internet version of "Junk
E-Mail." It is an attempt to deliver a message, over the Internet, to someone
who would not otherwise choose to receive it.  Almost all spam is commercial
advertising.  Potential target lists are created by scanning Usenet postings,
stealing Internet mailing lists, or searching the Web for addresses.  Such
information is gathered with automated searches to retrieve E-Mail addresses
for spamming.

The low cost of E-Mail spamming engines offered for sale with millions
of E-Mail addresses, coupled with the fact that the sender does not pay extra
to send E-Mail, has resulted in the current explosive growth of "junk E-Mail."
Currently, unless the spammer offers to sell illegal items, there is no legal
remedy to use to stop E-Mail spammers.

Congress is currently considering legislation to require the marking of
unsolicited commercial E-Mail (UCE), but that legislation is not yet complete.


TERMINOLOGY:

Mail Delivery Agent (MDA). This refers to the program used by the client to
retrieve E-Mail from a storage location. It is usually referred to as the
"mail client." An example of this is pine or eudora.

Mail Transfer Agent (MTA). This refers to the program used running on the
server to store and forward E-Mail messages. It is usually referred to as the
"mail server program." An example of this is sendmail or the server part of
exchange.


CONFIGURATION AND USAGE GUIDELINES:

Mail filtering in the MTA or MDA is the only practical solution today and it
is less than perfect.  There are three primary information sources used to
filter incoming E-Mail :

        - Header Information
        - Mailer Type (a special type of Header information)
        - IP Address (domain name).

Header filtering is performed by scanning the header and/or envelope of a
message, and comparing that information to a list of "filters."  If the
"From", "X-Sender", or "Sender" address is in the "filtering" list, the
message is dropped.  Filtering by E-Mail envelope and/or header information on
the MDA or MTA is the most effective way of limiting spam on your network.
Filtering on the MTA is accomplished by adding rules to the configuration for
the specific mail system running on the server.  The MDA filtering is accomp-
lished through configuration rules in the client uses to read mail.  The most
logical location for filtering is your MTA, since it can perform this service
for a larger number of mail accounts and is a central point for administra-
tion.  The down side to this is that users need to feedback "SPAM" information
to the E-Mail administrators to be incorporated into an organization-wide
filtering list. This requires continuous maintenance to keep the spamming
filters list up-to-date, since it is built in reaction to spamming activity.
Predetermined "filtering" lists are available in the public domain.  Also, if
the spamming filter list is not made with care, valid E-Mail messages may be
discarded along with the spam.

Mailer filtering uses the specific Header information field: "X-mailer."  This
type of filtering enables you to eliminate an entire class of senders --
those who use suspect Mail Delivery Agents.  Some of the more popular MDA's
with spammers are: Pegasus, Floodgate, Extractor, Fusion, MassE-Mail, Quick
Shot, NetMailer, and WorldMerge.  Be aware that, as with other Header
filtering, filtering on "X-mailer" always runs the risk of eliminating
legitimate E-Mail from people using these mailers.  It is the person and not
the mailer that is the problem.

Lastly, you can filter traffic from a domain or range of IP addresses.  This
is probably the easiest way to limit spam from those addresses associated
with spamming.  Again you may also block mail from legitimate users.


SOME DO NOTS

Do NOT spam, mail bomb, or hack spammers.  In many cases the site indicated as
the source of the spamming is not the spammers real site, so attacking that
site is not only wrong, but you are actually "spamming" yourself.

DO NOT Sending "remove" messages to a spammer.  It simply validates your
E-Mail address for future spammings.

Site E-Mail administrators should work closely with their users to make the
list decision about sites, mailers, and senders to be blocked.

CIAC has several self-subscribing mailing lists for electronic
publications:
1. CIAC-BULLETIN for Advisories, highest priority - time critical
   information and Bulletins, important computer security information;
2. SPI-ANNOUNCE for official news about Security Profile Inspector
   (SPI) software updates, new features, distribution and
   availability;
3. SPI-NOTES, for discussion of problems and solutions regarding the
   use of SPI products.

Our mailing lists are managed by a public domain software package
called Majordomo, which ignores E-Mail header subject lines. To
subscribe (add yourself) to one of our mailing lists, send the
following request as the E-Mail message body, substituting
ciac-bulletin, spi-announce OR spi-notes for list-name:

E-Mail to       ciac-listproc@llnl.gov or majordomo@tholia.llnl.gov:
        subscribe list-name
  e.g., subscribe ciac-bulletin

You will receive an acknowledgment E-Mail immediately with a confirmation
that you will need to mail back to the addresses above, as per the
instructions in the E-Mail.  This is a partial protection to make sure
you are really the one who asked to be signed up for the list in question.

If you include the word 'help' in the body of an E-Mail to the above address,
it will also send back an information file on how to subscribe/unsubscribe,
get past issues of CIAC bulletins via E-Mail, etc.

PLEASE NOTE: Many users outside of the DOE, ESnet, and NIH computing
communities receive CIAC bulletins.  If you are not part of these
communities, please contact your agency's response team to report
incidents. Your agency's team will coordinate with CIAC. The Forum of
Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) is a world-wide
organization. A list of FIRST member organizations and their
constituencies can be obtained via WWW at
