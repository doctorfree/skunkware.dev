SCO, Skunkware, and the Open Source Movement
********************************************

   `(rr@sco.com)', `Open Source Program Architect', `SCO'

   The UNIX technical community has a longstanding tradition of
publishing the source code to programs in order to share technical
accomplishments and facilitate peer review. Examples of this include
sendmail, bind, the X11 graphical windowing system and dozens of USENET
newsgroups devoted to the exchange of source. The recent rise in
popularity of the Apache web server and the Linux operating system have
provided a spotlight for "Open Source" software. How does SCO fit in
this picture ? How can SCO customers take advantage of this type of
software ? How can SCO developers contribute to this movement and
leverage the eyes and minds of thousands of programmers on the Internet
?

What is Open Source Software ?
******************************

   There are a wide variety of phrases used and misused in describing
software whose source is freely available. In fact, a plethora of
licensing schemes are available for such software. Commonly used terms
include Open Source, Free Software, Freeware, Shareware and Public
Domain software. Recently Eric Raymond has created urlnam
(http://www.opensource.org/) where he provides a definition of the Open
Source certification mark and links to a variety of conforming software
licenses at urlnam (http://www.opensource.org/osd.html).

   Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation have provided an
extensive review of the many categories of software whose source is
available at urlnam (http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/categories.html).
This article will not attempt to delve into the vagaries and nuances of
the specifics of each of these licenses and categories. The term Open
Source Software will be used to include all software whose source code
is freely available and openly accessible. This will include Freeware
and Shareware when accompanied by source (e.g. XV) as well as
commercial products whose source is freely available (e.g. Mini-SQL).

Open Source Components in SCO Products
**************************************

   Recent months have seen an explosion in Open Source awareness.
However, freely available source code has been with us for dozens of
years. Much of the infrastructure of the Internet is based on Open
Source software. Many of the core components of a UNIX operating
environment are Open Source.

   Examples of Open Source components in standard UNIX environments
include the mail transport agent `sendmail', the Berkeley Internet Name
Domain `BIND', Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol `DHCP', the
InterNetNews server `INN' and the X11 graphical windowing system `X'.

   Many Open Source components derived from research work done at
Universities.  Partly in support of this research the UNIX operating
system source has traditionally been offered to Universities at a
minimal licensing fee. When SCO acquired the rights to early UNIX
source (the Mini UNIX operating system; the UNIX V6 operating system;
the PWB UNIX operating system; and the UNIX V7 operating system, which
also covers Editions 1-5, and the 32V), source licenses were made
available at cost.

What is SCO Skunkware ?
***********************

   SCO Skunkware is the generic name for a free collection of software
prebuilt and prepackaged for installation on SCO systems. The SCO
OpenServer 5.0.5 and UnixWare 7 media kits contain an SCO Skunkware CD
engineered specifically for that operating system.

   Distributions are released on CD periodically and a repository of
this and previous distributions as well as updates and corrections can
always be found at urlnam (http://www.sco.com/skunkware). The SCO
Skunkware CD can also be ordered online via urlnam
(http://www.sco.com/offers/).

   SCO Skunkware contains a wide variety of software ranging from
educational and experimental research tools to commercial grade
software suitable for use on a production server.

   It is provided for free and is not formally supported by SCO.
However, Skunkware is undergoing something of a repositioning as
previously unsupported components move into the standard supported
product. What has, in the past, been known as Skunkware will likely
continue to exist as a component of a more traditionally supported Open
Source supplement.

   The software on the Skunkware CD-ROM is licensed under a variety of
terms. Much of it is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License (http://www.sco.com/skunkware/info/gpl.html).  Some is licensed
under the GNU Library General Public License
(http://www.sco.com/skunkware/info/lgpl.html).  Other components are
licensed under the Artistic License
(http://www.sco.com/skunkware/info/Artistic). Many of the components are
"Freeware" with no restrictions on their redistribution while a few
components are "Shareware" meaning the author would like you to try the
software and, if you wish to use it, send her some money. A few
components are commercial products which can be used freely for
non-commercial purposes.  Some components simply restrict their use to
non-commercial purposes.

   To determine the licensing conditions for a particular component,
see the corresponding source in the source directory
(http://www.sco.com/skunkware/src). With the infrequent exception of
SCO proprietary code, all Skunkware components are accompanied by the
source used to build them.

   The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc. and SCO Skunkware are not related to,
affiliated with or licensed by the famous Lockheed Martin Skunk Works
(R), the creator of the F-117 Stealth Fighter, SR-71, U-2,
Venturestar(tm), Darkstar(tm), and other pioneering air and spacecraft.

The Open Source Support Model
*****************************

   Open Source Software and SCO Skunkware have an alternative support
model.  Since the source is available, it is often possible for the
end-user to self-support or to easily consult with local experts.
Further, due to the communal and open environment in which the software
is developed (see below), there are often quite active and technically
adept online discussion groups, mailing lists, web sites and ftp
download areas for patches and updates.

   One drawback to this model is that it is difficult for a vendor to
provide monolithic support for a rapidly diverging Open Source product
as the user base modifies their source code and rebuilds the system.
Note that a recent survey of vendors of an Open Source operating system
(Linux) revealed that there are over 40 commercial variants of Linux.
This can pose severe compatibility, interoperability and support
problems.

The Open Source Development Model
*********************************

   Open Source development teams are rapidly emerging as the dominant
force behind the continuing evolution of computing. Eric Raymond's
paper, The Cathedral and The Bazaar (urlnam
(http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/)) details the
philosophy, scope and social organization of this model.  "Release
early and often, delegate everything you can, be open to the point of
promiscuity" is a development philosophy sharply in contradistinction
with the conservatively centralized approach of the traditional
development model in which large software projects were "built like
cathedrals, carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of
mages working in splendid isolation, with no beta to be released before
its time".

   SCO is attempting to synthesize these models - carefully protecting
those customers heavily invested in the stability, interoperability and
compatibility offered by the traditional approach while rapidly
deploying emerging technologies and methodologies offered by the bazaar.

Linux Emulation
***************

   SCO recently engaged in an Open Source project which oversees the
development and distribution of lxrun, a Linux emulation system. This
open source project is being incorporated into UnixWare 7 as a
supported feature of the operating system. Additional details on lxrun
are available at urlnam (http://www.sco.com/skunkware/lxrun/).

   The lxrun project is an example of how rapidly an open source
project can evolve. It's also an example of one of the many Skunkware
components that are being absorbed into the standard supported product.
