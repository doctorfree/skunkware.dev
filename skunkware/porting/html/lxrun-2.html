<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Implementation</A></H2>

<P>The emulator needed to handle the following major issues (detailed below):
system call handling along with remapping of arguments, flags, return values
and error codes; library pathname lookup and remapping; ioctl mappings for
the various major devices and differences in the tty subsystems.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Design goals</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Allow execution of Intel Linux binaries on other Intel UNIX platforms</LI>
<LI>Exist entirely in user-space (no kernel modifications)</LI>
<LI>No modification of the Linux binaries or libraries required</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Difference in syscall handling</A>
</H2>

<P>System call handling is implemented differently between Linux and Intel
UNIX System V platforms; that is each uses a different instruction
to implement the switch to kernel mode.
<P>Intel Unix System V uses a "lcall $0x07".  In Linux an "int $0x80" software
interrupt instruction is used, which jumps to the  system-call-handling 
portion of the Linux kernel. On SCO systems, "int $0x80" is an unused vector 
and therefore causes a general protection trap resulting in a SIGSEGV
signal. Lxrun intercepts these signals and calls the SCO equivalent of
the system call that the Linux program attempted. In many cases this is
a direct map or call of the equivalent native system call, in other cases
some mapping or translation of arguments passed in and flags and error codes
passed out is required. Where there is no equivalent system call available
on the emulated system or the equivalent syscall mapping has not been
implemented the system call fails and returns an errorcode of ENOSYS.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Pathname for loading Linux libraries </A>
</H2>

<P>Because lxrun works at the system call level, any Linux shared
libraries required by the application must be present in the
emulation environment.  This leads to a possible filename-space
conflict between native and Linux binaries.  To resolve this
problem, lxrun remaps any pathnames beginning with /lib,
/usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or /usr/X11R6/lib by prepending them
with a "Linux root" path.  This path is specified at compile
time and can be overridden by setting the LINUX_ROOT environment
variable. This remapping allows the user to install a set of
Linux libraries in a separate directory hierarchy from the
native system libraries, thus avoiding conflicts.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Device major number mappings</A>
</H2>

<P>The arguments to an ioctl call alone do not provide enough
information to remap the command number correctly.  This is
because the same command number can have different meanings to
different drivers.
<P>Lxrun works around this problem by maintaining a mapping from
open file descriptors to drivers.  On the first ioctl call to a
new file descriptor, lxrun determines the associated major
device number.  It compares this with a table of drivers and
major device numbers set up at run-time.  This mapping is then
cached to improve performance on future ioctl calls to that file
descriptor.  Lxrun can then take the driver into consideration
when remapping ioctl command numbers.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Differences in kernel tty systems</A>
</H2>

<P>The following is a discourse on lxrun tty handling from Robert Lipe
<A HREF="mailto:robertl@dgii.com">(robertl@dgii.com)</A>, the
principal author of lxrun's tty handling code:
<P>"The kernel tty systems are very different. The user level tty systems
are actually quite similar, fortunately for lxrun. Most of the members
of things like termio and struct termios are the same size, alignment, 
and offset. Even most of the bitfields fall into place. While
it would have been much safer to do
<HR>
<PRE>
        if ( (lx_tio->c_cflag &amp; LX_CBAUD) == LX_B50)
                tio->c_cflag |= B50;
        if (lx_tio->c_iflag &amp; LX_ICANON) 
                tio->c_iflag |= ICANON;
</PRE>
<HR>

and repeat this for each of a couple hundred flags, the reality was that
it generated horrible code that would have performed poorly and been
a nightmare to maintain. 
<P>The only sticky spot was that Linux has four distinctly separate
members in c_cc (the control character array) for VMIN, VTIME, EOF, 
and EOL. Most System V's including OpenServer (I can't recall what SVR[45] 
does here) use the same offset and multiplex this into two bytes. In reality, 
since they can never both be active at the same time (if ICANON is set, EOF 
and EOL are used. If ICANON is clear, VMIN, VTIME are used) this doesn't turn
out to be much of a issue.
<P>[Since] TCGETA and TCSETA are by far the most frequently used, I implemented 
them first (and their derivatives that wait and flush and the derivatives of 
each of those for POSIX struct termios). With those 8 in hand, I started firing 
up applications that were known to do wierd things to the tty. When elvis 
(the Linux vi binary I had at the time) worked well enough, I submitted the 
changes. Then, I just used more and more applications and picked up a few 
stragglers like FIONREAD that mapped very simply. 
<P>Are there hazards in any of this? Certainly. Each system has a few
bits in each of the available ioctls that don't exist in the other
system. There is some overlap. We haven't seen any real world
failures becuase of this. The reality seems to be that the programs
that drive serial ports to the crazy edge don't make sense to emulate
anyway. For example, someone once asked me why Linux ecu (a kermit-like
program) didn't work well. Since source for it is available and it
supports OpenServer just fine, use the native binary instead. Someone
once asked me about running Linux ppp, but that's similarly nonsensical,
though doomed to failure for different reasons."
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 Miscellaneous issues</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> For local displays, SCO OpenServer uses ":0.0" and UnixWare uses
"unix:0.0".  The former causes Linux X11 binaries to try to
use shared memory, which won't work with the native X server.
The latter causes a name lookup for the machine "unix" which
probably fails. These two cases are detected and the DISPLAY
is set to contain a valid machine name instead.</LI>
<LI> Documentation is supplied in the <CODE>doc</CODE> subdirectory of the lxrun
source. This currently consists of this document, a FAQ, a document
describing how to get the Linux StarOffice suite to run, and the system
call mapping table.</LI>
<LI> Various packaging conveniences have been supplied. For instance, the
necessary Linux shared libraries have been re-packaged in the native
installation format. A shell script, lxfront, useful in the execution
of Linux a.out and statically-linked ELF binaries, has been supplied.
To use lxfront:
<UL>
<LI> Put lxfront and any Linux a.out or statically-linked ELF 
binaries in /usr/local/linux/bin</LI>
<LI> Put lxrun in /usr/local/bin</LI>
<LI> Create links in /usr/local/bin to lxfront with the same 
names as your Linux binaries.</LI>
</UL>

Executing these links should invoke lxrun on your Linux program.
