  SCO, Skunkware, and the Open Source Movement

  February 1, 1999

  The UNIX technical community has a longstanding tradition of publish-
  ing the source code to programs in order to share technical accom-
  plishments and facilitate peer review. Examples of this include send-
  mail, bind, the X11 graphical windowing system and dozens of USENET
  newsgroups devoted to the exchange of source. The recent rise in popu-
  larity of the Apache web server and the Linux operating system have
  provided a spotlight for "Open Source" software. How does SCO fit in
  this picture ? How can SCO customers take advantage of this type of
  software ? How can SCO developers contribute to this movement and
  leverage the eyes and minds of thousands of programmers on the Inter-
  net ?

  There are a wide variety of phrases used and misused in describing
  software whose source is freely available. In fact, a plethora of
  licensing schemes are available for such software. Commonly used terms
  include Open Source, Free Software, Freeware, Shareware and Public
  Domain software. Recently Eric Raymond has created
  <http://www.opensource.org/> where he provides a definition of the
  Open Source certification mark and links to a variety of conforming
  software licenses at  <http://www.opensource.org/osd.html>.

  Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation have provided an
  extensive review of the many categories of software whose source is
  available at <http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/categories.html>. This
  article will not attempt to delve into the vagaries and nuances of the
  specifics of each of these licenses and categories. The term Open
  Source Software will be used to include all software whose source code
  is freely available and openly accessible. This will include Freeware
  and Shareware when accompanied by source (e.g. XV) as well as
  commercial products whose source is freely available (e.g. Mini-SQL).

  Recent months have seen an explosion in Open Source awareness.
  However, freely available source code has been with us for dozens of
  years. Much of the infrastructure of the Internet is based on Open
  Source software. Many of the core components of a UNIX operating
  environment are Open Source.

  Examples of Open Source components in standard UNIX environments
  include the mail transport agent sseennddmmaaiill, the Berkeley Internet Name
  Domain BBIINNDD, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol DDHHCCPP, the
  InterNetNews server IINNNN and the X11 graphical windowing system XX.

  Many Open Source components derived from research work done at
  Universities.  Partly in support of this research the UNIX operating
  system source has traditionally been offered to Universities at a
  minimal licensing fee. When SCO acquired the rights to early UNIX
  source (the Mini UNIX operating system; the UNIX V6 operating system;
  the PWB UNIX operating system; and the UNIX V7 operating system, which
  also covers Editions 1-5, and the 32V), source licenses were made
  available at cost.

  SCO Skunkware is the generic name for a free collection of software
  prebuilt and prepackaged for installation on SCO systems. The SCO
  OpenServer 5.0.5 and UnixWare 7 media kits contain an SCO Skunkware CD
  engineered specifically for that operating system.

  Distributions are released on CD periodically and a repository of this
  and previous distributions as well as updates and corrections can
  always be found at  <http://www.sco.com/skunkware>. The SCO Skunkware
  CD can also be ordered online via  <http://www.sco.com/offers/>.

  SCO Skunkware contains a wide variety of software ranging from
  educational and experimental research tools to commercial grade
  software suitable for use on a production server.

  It is provided for free and is not formally supported by SCO. However,
  Skunkware is undergoing something of a repositioning as previously
  unsupported components move into the standard supported product. What
  has, in the past, been known as Skunkware will likely continue to
  exist as a component of a more traditionally supported Open Source
  supplement.

  The software on the Skunkware CD-ROM is licensed under a variety of
  terms. Much of it is licensed under the terms of the GNU General
  Public License <http://www.sco.com/skunkware/info/gpl.html>.  Some is
  licensed under the GNU Library General Public License
  <http://www.sco.com/skunkware/info/lgpl.html>.  Other components are
  licensed under the Artistic License
  <http://www.sco.com/skunkware/info/Artistic>. Many of the components
  are "Freeware" with no restrictions on their redistribution while a
  few components are "Shareware" meaning the author would like you to
  try the software and, if you wish to use it, send her some money. A
  few components are commercial products which can be used freely for
  non-commercial purposes.  Some components simply restrict their use to
  non-commercial purposes.

  To determine the licensing conditions for a particular component, see
  the corresponding source in the source directory
  <http://www.sco.com/skunkware/src>. With the infrequent exception of
  SCO proprietary code, all Skunkware components are accompanied by the
  source used to build them.

  The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc. and SCO Skunkware are not related to,
  affiliated with or licensed by the famous Lockheed Martin Skunk Works
  (R), the creator of the F-117 Stealth Fighter, SR-71, U-2,
  Venturestar(tm), Darkstar(tm), and other pioneering air and
  spacecraft.

  Open Source Software and SCO Skunkware have an alternative support
  model.  Since the source is available, it is often possible for the
  end-user to self-support or to easily consult with local experts.
  Further, due to the communal and open environment in which the
  software is developed (see below), there are often quite active and
  technically adept online discussion groups, mailing lists, web sites
  and ftp download areas for patches and updates.

  One drawback to this model is that it is difficult for a vendor to
  provide monolithic support for a rapidly diverging Open Source product
  as the user base modifies their source code and rebuilds the system.
  Note that a recent survey of vendors of an Open Source operating
  system (Linux) revealed that there are over 40 commercial variants of
  Linux. This can pose severe compatibility, interoperability and
  support problems.

  Open Source development teams are rapidly emerging as the dominant
  force behind the continuing evolution of computing. Eric Raymond's
  paper, The Cathedral and The Bazaar (
  <http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/>) details the
  philosophy, scope and social organization of this model.  "Release
  early and often, delegate everything you can, be open to the point of
  promiscuity" is a development philosophy sharply in contradistinction
  with the conservatively centralized approach of the traditional
  development model in which large software projects were "built like
  cathedrals, carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of
  mages working in splendid isolation, with no beta to be released
  before its time".

  SCO is attempting to synthesize these models - carefully protecting
  those customers heavily invested in the stability, interoperability
  and compatibility offered by the traditional approach while rapidly
  deploying emerging technologies and methodologies offered by the
  bazaar.

  SCO recently engaged in an Open Source project which oversees the
  development and distribution of lxrun, a Linux emulation system. This
  open source project is being incorporated into UnixWare 7 as a
  supported feature of the operating system. Additional details on lxrun
  are available at <http://www.sco.com/skunkware/lxrun/>.

  The lxrun project is an example of how rapidly an open source project
  can evolve. It's also an example of one of the many Skunkware
  components that are being absorbed into the standard supported
  product.
