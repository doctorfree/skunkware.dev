		SCO Skunkware Download/Install Instructions
		===========================================

SCO OpenServer Custom Installable Media Images
----------------------------------------------

Note: Compressed tar archives of binary distributions for
SCO OpenServer are also available. Many of these have not yet been
engineered for installation with SCO custom. You can find these manually
installable packages via :
    ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/osr5/dist/

If you'd like to install all of the custom installable Skunkware 97 
OpenServer components and don't have the Skunkware 97 CD-ROM, follow
these instructions :

1) Make sure you have 60MB free in your root filesystem.

Also, make sure you have another 60MB available either in root
or in another filesystem.

Be prepared to spend some time waiting.  See table below.

2) Create an empty directory on your machine to hold the images:
   # mkdir /tmp/sw97media
Note: This is where your media images will be downloaded.
If necessary, make this empty directory on another filesystem.

3) Establish an anonymous ftp connection to ftp.sco.com
   # cd /tmp/sw97media
   # ftp -i ftp.sco.com
   Name: ftp
   Password: your e-mail address

4) Change working directory to the Skunkware media images directory
   ftp> cd skunkware/osr5/cdmt/archives/TAPE

5) Setup for automatic download of binary images
   ftp> bin

6) Download media images - there are about 100 VOL files.

   ftp> mget *

After completing the transfer, exit the ftp session

   ftp> quit

Now, install the Skunkware 97 OpenServer components by issuing the
following command (as root) :

   # custom -p SKUNK97:default -i -z `pwd`

Note that the Xmcd installation will ask if you want to connect
to  "remote CD database servers".  You can safely say "no" and
set this up later.

Xmcd installation will also undertake to run mkdev cdrom if the cdrom device
is not fully configured.

You can now remove the media images, or archive them to tape for use
on other systems.

If you wish to remove them now :
   # rm -f VOL* 

Transfer times via ftp will depend on the speed of your connection.
Here are some (optimal) ballpark estimates of the download times 
for various download speeds :

 a) 28.8kb (typical modem) transfer duration:
 ( (50 * 1024 * 1024) / ( 28.8 * 1024 / 8) ) / (60 * 60)
 4 hours

 b) 56kb (Frame Relay) transfer duration:
 ( (50 * 1024 * 1024) / ( 56 * 1024 / 8) ) / (60 * 60)
 2 hours

 c) 64kb (single B channel ISDN) transfer duration:
 ( (50 * 1024 * 1024) / (64 * 1024 / 8) ) / (60 * 60)
 1 3/4 hours

 d) 128kb (dual B channel ISDN) transfer duration:
 ( (50 * 1024 * 1024) / (128 * 1024 / 8) ) / (60 * 60)
 40 minutes

 e) 1.544mb (max T1 line) transfer duration:
 ( (50 * 1024 * 1024) / (1.544 * (1024 * 1024) / 8) ) / 60 
 4 1/2 minutes
