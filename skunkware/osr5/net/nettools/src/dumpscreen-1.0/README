dumpscreen shows the contents of a multiscreen(M).  When run with no arguments,
it shows the contents of the current multiscreen to stdout.
Otherwise, dumpscreen can take one argument: the number of the multiscreen
to display:

Usage:  dumpscreen number
        where number is from 0 through 11
        0=ALT-F1, 11=ALT-F12

If the screen is in graphical mode then dumpscreen will display the message:
screen ALT-F1 is in graphics mode; terminating.

Note that spyfs (part of nettools) has a screenmem directory which works
similar to dumpscreen.  spyfs will pad the contents of its screen memory 
file with a newline.  Unlike spyfs, dumpscreen works on ODT3.0.

dumpscreen assumes you will have a VGA-compatible graphics card and
requires read access on /dev/vga and /dev/kmem.
