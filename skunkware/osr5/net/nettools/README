                         Network/Security Tools TLS 2.4
                                  containing

argus-1.5, arpwatch-1.7, courtney-1.3, dumpscreen-1.0, nacl-2, sockinfo-2.8, 
spyfs-1.1, ss-1.0, and tcpdump-3.0.4+

This is the high level README which describes features of each of the
above programs.  More information on each program can be found in the
respective README file.

The source code used to build the programs in this TLS is not available 
from SCO at this time.

Most of the binaries in this TLS will not work on any SCO release prior to 
Open Server 5.0.0.  Aside from sockinfo, versions of these programs are 
not available for releases prior to Open Server 5.0.0.

These programs are being ported to UnixWare 2.1.  So far, I have completed
tcpdump.  The UnixWare version does not require a dedicated NIC. 

                                 Descriptions

argus:      gather statistics of packets applied against filter specification.

arpwatch:   maintains database of ARP or RARP traffic and sends root mail
            for new machines or when MAC or IP address changes

courtney:   perl wrapper around tcpdump to check for SATAN probes

dumpscreen: show the contents of a multiscreen(M) to stdout.

nacl:       BSD socket access control list driver.

sockinfo:   netstat -a with a lot more detail.  
            a similar program is lsof (anonymous ftp to 
            vic.cc.purdue.edu:pub/tools/unix/lsof)

spyfs:      A filesystem that allows authorised users to watch people
            typing on console, serial ports, or pseudo ttys, as well as 
            any program output.  Also shows multiscreen(M) contents.
            Can also inject characters as if they typed it.  

ss:         show STREAMS stacks and any data stuck in a queue.  same as
            crash(ADM)'s stream and queue commands only displayed differently.

tcpdump:    shows network traffic on wire that matches a criteria you select.


I'm interested in hearing any comments (good or bad) you may have on any
of the programs in nettools.  Send them via email to nathan@sco.com.

Future work as time permits...
------------------------------
- add a "tap" STREAMS module between MDI driver and DLPI module to eliminate
  dedicated-NIC requirement for argus, arpwatch, and tcpdump.
- add TLI and hours of operation support to nacl
- create a "dup" interface for TCP/IP which will automatically send packets
  to the appropriate interface in case of NIC hardware problems.
