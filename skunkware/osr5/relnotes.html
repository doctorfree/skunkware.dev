<DT><A NAME="serious"></A>
<DD>
Many of the components of SCO Skunkware may be viewed as productivity and
development tools to be taken seriously. Don't let its whimsical nature
fool you. Examples of serious tools on Skunkware 98 include:
<UL>
<LI>The GNU C Compilation system
<LI>Mtools - DOS filesystem manipulation tools
<LI>Scripting languages (Tcl, Tk, Python, Expect)
<LI>Internet/Network tools (apache, squid, xdir, ldap, many more)
<LI>Editors and text processing tools (xcoral, xemacs, ghostscript, vim, xhtml)
<LI>Many many more
</UL>
<DT><A NAME="fun"></A>
<DD>
Of course, Skunkware also contains fun stuff. Gotta have something to keep
the polecats entertained thru the night. Examples include:
<UL>
<LI>Games (xdoom, xgalaga, xboing, xpool)
<LI>Graphics (mathematical recreations, animation viewers, image manipulators)
<LI>Audio (audio players and editors, mixers, CD players, games with sound)
<LI>Stuff (view astrology charts, graphical fish tank, lots more)
</UL>
<DT><A NAME="experimental"></A>
<DD>
Several of the components on this CD should be considered experimental.
Consider Skunkware a research tool. Examples:
<UL>
<LI>Egcs, the Experimental GNU Compilation System from Cygnus.
<LI>Alpha or pre-release versions of window managers and graphical tools
<LI>A variety of Java classes and applications from Acme Laboratories
<LI>VRwave, a Java based VRML 2.0 browser
<LI>Endo, a tool for exploring dynamical systems in the plane
</UL>

<LI><A NAME="mounting">Mounting the Skunkware 98 CD-ROM</A>
<P>
[Note that it is not necessary to mount the Skunkware 98 CD-ROM
in order to install the custom installable packages. See the section
below on <A HREF="#installing">installing the Skunkware 98 software</A>.]
<P>
To mount the Skunkware 98 CD-ROM on an SCO UnixWare system, use the command:
<PRE>
    # mount -r -f cdfs /dev/cdrom/c1b0t0l0 /&lt;mount-point&gt;
</PRE>
where &lt;mount-point&gt; refers to the full pathname of the directory on
which you wish to mount the CD-ROM (e.g. /mnt).
Note also that the CD-ROM device name may vary from system to system
(the exact name for the cdrom device is usually the only entry in /dev/cdrom).
<P>
On an SCO OpenServer Release 5 system issue the command:
<PRE>
    # mount -r /dev/cd0 /&lt;mount-point&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
<LI><A NAME="moving">Making room for the Skunkware 98 software</A>
<P>
The installation of all the Skunkware 98 components requires about 500 MB 
of free space on the root partition (/opt/K/SKUNK98). If your root partition
does not have sufficient space, or you wish to utilize an alternate filesystem
for the Skunkware 98 components, prior to installing Skunkware 98 create
a symbolic link in /opt/K as follows:
<PRE>
        # mkdir /u/skunk98
        # cd /opt/K
        # ln -s /u/skunk98 SKUNK98
</PRE>
The above commands assume a separate /u filesystem with sufficient disk space.
The exact name of the alternate filesystem mount point is system dependent.
<P>
You may also wish to place your /usr/local file hierarchy on a separate
filesystem. To do so, create the appropriate symbolic link - e.g.
<PRE>
    # ln -s /u/local /usr/local
</PRE>
<P>
<LI><A NAME="installing">Installing the Skunkware 98 Software</A>
<P>
The installation of all the Skunkware 98 components requires about 500 MB 
of free space on the root partition for OpenServer (/opt/K/SKUNK98). 
<P>
An interactive graphical installation can be performed by running the
Software Manager (/etc/custom) as root. Select "Software" -> "Install New".
If your Skunkware CD is inserted in the local CD-ROM drive, install from the
local host and select the appropriate CD-ROM drive as the Media Device.
<P>
After the Software Manager has read the Skunkware product database, you can
select which components you wish to install or choose to install the full
product (see <A HREF="#moving">notes above on disk space considerations</A>).
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> <I>A full installation of SCO Skunkware 98 will consume over
500 Megabytes of disk space and take several hours</I>.
<P>
To install an individual package, execute the command:
<PRE>
    # custom -p SKUNK98:default:Package -i -m /dev/rcd0
</PRE>
where "Package" is the name of the desired component. See the file
<A HREF="osr5/COMPONENTS.html">
/&lt;mount-point&gt;/osr5/COMPONENTS</A> for the list of available components.
<P>
If, as root, you are running the X.Desktop, then you can configure your
system to mount the SCO Skunkware 98 CD-ROM by double-clicking the System
Administration folder -&gt; Filesystems -&gt; Filesystem Manager. Alternatively,
at a root shell prompt, type "scoadmin f" to bring up the Filesystem Manager.
Next select Mount -&gt; Add Mount Configuration -&gt; Local and enter /dev/cd0 for 
the device and a mount point. Change the "Can Users Mount" 
to Yes and uncheck the "At System Startup" mount. After completing this 
operation, you should be able to mount and unmount the SCO Skunkware 98 CD-ROM 
by typing "mnt &lt;mount-point&gt; and "umnt &lt;mount-point&gt; as any user.
<P>
<P>
After completing the installation of the Skunkware 98 components you desire,
you may wish to add /usr/local/bin to your PATH and /usr/local/man to your
MANPATH. You may also wish to add /usr/local/java to your CLASSPATH. It should
not be necessary to add /usr/local/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH as the
Skunkware 98 shared libraries have been built with the appropriate flags.
<P>
To query the system about installed Skunkware 98 packages, issue the 
following command:
<PRE>
    # custom -p SKUNK98:default: -l
</PRE>
<P>
<LI><A NAME="browsing">Browsing the Skunkware 98 HTML Documents</A>
<P>
For an introductory tour, point a web browser at 
<A HREF="index.html">
/&lt;mount-point&gt;/index.html</A>
<PRE>
    # /usr/bin/X11/netscape file:/&lt;mount-point&gt;/index.html
</PRE>
If you do not have Netscape Navigator installed, download a trial copy from
<A HREF="http://www2.sco.com">http://www2.sco.com</A> 
or (for OpenServer) install NCSA Mosaic off of this CD:
<PRE>
    # custom -p SKUNK98:default:Mosaic -i -m /dev/rcd0
</PRE>
or use any browser that supports tables and open the URL file:/&lt;mount-point&gt;/index.html
(assuming you mounted the CD on /&lt;mount-point&gt;).
<P>
If you do not have or want a graphical browser, you can install Lynx 2.7.1
(a character browser) off of this CD (OpenServer only, if you are running
UnixWare 7 then Lynx is included by default).
<PRE>
    # custom -p SKUNK98:default:Lynx -i -m /dev/rcd0
</PRE>
Then execute the command:
<PRE>
    # lynx file:/&lt;mount-point&gt;/index.html
</PRE>
<P>
SCO Skunkware 98 contains files suitable for installation on
SCO OpenServer systems with the Software Manager facility (/etc/custom). 
In addition, there are compressed archives of pre-compiled utilities
which can be extraced manually. Finally, there are 
<A HREF="src/">hundreds of source archives</A>
(almost everything on the CD is accompanied by the source used to build it).
<P>
<LI><A NAME="removing">Removing the Skunkware 98 software</A>
<P>
On SCO OpenServer systems, use the Software Manager (/etc/custom) to remove
Skunkware 98 components. This can be done interactively by running custom and
selecting the component(s) you wish to remove, or non-interactively by
issuing a command like the following:
<PRE>
    # custom -p SKUNK98:default -r &lt;package-list&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="other"><B>Accessing the CD on other platforms</B></A>
<P>
On any other system, after mounting or otherwise making the High-Sierra
Rockridge CD-ROM filesystem accessible, point your WWW browser to
&lt;mount-point&gt;/index.html where &lt;mount-point&gt; indicates
the UNIX directory or Windows drive representing the CD-ROM.
<P>
<A NAME="source"><B>Source Code Distribution</B></A>
<P>
In almost all cases, source code is also provided, so you can rebuild 
for earlier SCO releases or other platforms.
Source code is provided in the <A HREF="src/CONTENTS.html">src directory</A>.  
In some cases, source code is provided but no
compiled binaries. The source distributions are in gzip-compressed
tar or cpio format. In order to extract these, use the command:

<PRE>
    $ gzcat /&lt;mount-point&gt;/src/&lt;directory&gt;/&lt;package&gt;.tar.gz | tar xf -
</PRE>

or, in the case of a compressed cpio archive:

<PRE>
    $ gzcat /&lt;mount-point&gt;/src/&lt;directory&gt;/&lt;package&gt;.cpio.gz | cpio -icdu
</PRE>

Where &lt;directory&gt; refers to the top-level source directory
and &lt;package&gt; is the package name (e.g. gzip-1.2.4).
<P>
If you do not have gzcat installed (part of the gzip package), you can
install it off of the SCO Skunkware 98 CD via the command:

<PRE>
        (OpenServer systems)
        # custom -p SKUNK98:default:GZIP -i -m /dev/rcd0

        (UnixWare 7 systems)
        # pkgadd -d /&lt;mount-point&gt;/uw7/gzip.pkg

        (UnixWare 2.x systems)
        # pkgadd -d /&lt;mount-point&gt;/uw2/gzip.pkg

<A NAME="config"><B>Default Package Configurations</B></A>
<P>
Many of the Skunkware packages contain configuration files. In order to
avoid excessive user interaction during installation and to provide a
consistent and well integrated set of configurations, the Skunkware 98
packages have been pre-configured (with the exception of xmcd which will
prompt you for your CD-ROM make and model; and inn which may prompt for a
"news" user password).
<P>
Generally, you will not need to alter the default configurations but you
may choose to do so. Some of the package pre-configurations are as follows:
<UL>
<LI><A NAME="apache">
The Apache web server is configured to run on port 8080</A>. If you are not
going to use Squid as an httpd accelerator, you may wish to run the Apache
web server on port 80. To do so, modify /usr/local/lib/apache/etc/httpd.conf.
Further, the default document directory for the Apache web server is set to
/usr/local/lib/apache/share/htdocs. If you wish to serve your HTML documents out
of a different location, modify /usr/local/lib/apache/etc/srm.conf and
/usr/local/lib/apache/etc/access.conf
<LI><A NAME="squid">
The Squid Internet Object Cache is configured to run on port 80</A> and to 
act as an httpd accelerator for the server running on port 8080 (by default,
the Apache web server). If you wish to use this default configuration,
remember to stop/disable any other server running on port 80. In particular,
the Netscape FastTrack server is usually configured to run on port 80.
<LI><A NAME="gcc">
Skunkware 98 contains a custom installable integrated GNU compilation system.
This includes both the Free Software Foundation's GNU C Compiler and Cygnus' 
experimental GNU C Compiler (EGCS).
The file /etc/default/gcc can be used to specify which is the default
preferred compiler. The entries in this file set the system-wide default.
An individual user can override this default by setting and exporting the
PREFERRED_GCC environment variable. This variable must be set to either
/usr/local/lib/front-fsf or /usr/local/lib/front-egcs. If set incorrectly,
the system will revert to the preference specified in /etc/default/gcc.
<LI><A NAME="htmlman">
Several packages install documentation, manuals, tutorials and other</A>
introductory and informative matter as HTML documents in /usr/local/man/html.
During the installation of these packages, a symbolic link is created in
the default Apache web server document root. Thus, the documentation for
these packages can be accessed via a browser. For instance, the HTML documents
describing the Xcoral editor are installed in /usr/local/man/html/xcoral.
A symbolic link pointing to this location is installed as
/usr/local/lib/apache/htdocs/xcoral. Thus, to access the Xcoral HTML 
documentation, you need only open the URL http://your.server.name/xcoral/
These convenience links are provided for xcoral, fetchmail, addressbook,
apache, metahtml, msql, tcsh, hypermail, squid and the TIFF
library package.
<LI><A NAME="sw7mount">
If you mount the CD-ROM under your default document root, </A>
you will be able to serve up the Skunkware 98 HTML documents
with your web server. For instance, after installing the apache and squid
packages, if you mounted the Skunkware 98 CD-ROM on 
/usr/local/lib/apache/share/htdocs/skunkware, then opening the URL
http://your.server.name/skunkware/ would allow you to browse the contents
of the Skunkware 98 CD-ROM from any browser that could access your server.
<LI><A NAME="inn">
The INN installation is configured to install many of its files owned </A>
by the user "news" and group "news". During the inn package installation,
this user/group is created if it doesn't already exist. If the installation
creates a "news" user, you will be prompted for a password during installation.
<LI><A NAME="xmcd">
The Xmcd (Motif audio CD player) package will prompt you for the CD drive </A>
configuration during the installation. If you wish to configure Xmcd during
the installation, you should know the make and model number of your CD drive(s).
<LI><A NAME="netpbm">
The Netpbm suite of graphical file conversion utilities installs its </A>
binaries in /usr/local/netpbm. That's because there are 175 of them. In order
to use these quite useful utilities, you will need to do one of the following:
    <UL>
    <LI>Invoke them with an absolute path (e.g. /usr/local/netpbm/giftopnm ...)
    <LI>Add /usr/local/netpbm to your execution PATH
    <LI>Move, link or symlink the Netpbm utilities you wish to use into a
        location that is in your PATH (e.g. /usr/local/bin)
    </UL>
<LI><A NAME="procdump">The "proc" utility and its companion "msize"</A>
are installed in /opt/bin. You may wish to add /opt/bin to your PATH or
create appropriate symbolic links out to an existing PATH component.
For more information on the proc utility, see the manual page at
/opt/man/man1/proc.1.
<LI><A NAME="wmconf">Alternate window managers' default configurations</A>
are those provided in the source distributions and will need to be tailored
for use on UnixWare 7. That is, the rc startup files for fvwm, fvwm95,
AfterStep and Enlightenment will need system-specific
configuration. The Skunkware team plans on making UnixWare 7 specific
window manager configuration files available via the Skunkware web site at
<A HREF="http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/x11/winman/">
http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/x11/winman/</A>.
<LI><A NAME="xgalaga">Xgalaga defaults to playing with audio on</A>.
In order to run it on a system with no audio support, use the -nosound

    $ xgal -nosound

<LI><A NAME="enlighten">Many of the enlightenment window manager themes</A>
assume they have a high resolution (e.g. 1280x1024) and 16 bits per pixel
or more. These themes will not work well on, say, an 800x600 256 color visual.
The DEFAULT theme seems to work well on most systems. Enlightenment is cool.
I recommend getting a quality video card and monitor so you can check out
all the themes.

<LI> <A NAME="disk5">A full installation of the SCO Skunkware 98 </A>
  media images for SCO OpenServer
  requires approximately 500 Mb of disk space. If your system's root filesystem
  does not contain sufficient disk space (a check is performed at the
  beginning of the installation), then you may wish to perform the following
  workaround (rather than removing files from the root partition):
<PRE>
      # cd /opt/K
      # ln -s /u/local local
</PRE>
  Where /u/local resides on an additional disk with sufficient space.

PseudoColor visual</A>.
Before attempting to run either xdoom or xgrab, the front-end for xgrabsc, 
you will need to configure your X server to run in 256 color mode. Sorry.

<P>
</LI><LI><A NAME="wmexit">Exiting the alternate window managers</A>
does not always exit the X session and return you to the graphical login.
If this happens, switch to another screen (ctrl-alt-fkey) and kill the

<LI><A NAME="man5">
  The SCO OpenServer 5 man command</A> expects the man pages to be in
  directories named man.suffix and cat.suffix. Many public domain
  packages place their manual pages in directories like man1, man8,
  cat1, cat8 and so on. Further, these directories are usually located
  in /usr/local/man rather than /usr/man. To remedy this, add /usr/local/man
  to your MANPATH (see /etc/default/man) and create symbolic links from
  mann to man.n, catn to cat.n and so on.

  On OpenServer, if you use g++ to link an ELF binary, libg++ and libstdc++</A>

  actually used by your program.  Such binaries will not run on
  machines that do not have the libg++ and libstdc++ shared
  libraries installed.  If you know your program does not need
  these libraries, you can link it using gcc and they will not be
  included.  In programs that do use libg++ or libstdc++, you can
  maintain portability by using the "-static" flag which makes a
  statically-linked binary.
