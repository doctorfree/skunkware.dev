The file header-files-osr5-rr.tar.gz contains OpenServer 5.0.7 MP3
system header file modifications that I have made for compatibility
with the FSU-threads and GNU Pth user space threads packages as well
as some mods to string headers for ease of porting.

The contents should be as follows:

usr/include/sys/types.h
usr/include/strings.h
usr/include/synch.h
usr/include/string.h
usr/include/limits.h
usr/include/sys/types.h.00
usr/include/strings.h.00
usr/include/synch.h.00
usr/include/string.h.00
usr/include/limits.h.00

The files with .00 suffix are the originals prior to modification.

After installing these modified versions, use -D_PTH_PTHREAD_H_
to compile applications that use FSU-threads or GNU Pth.

Use -D_NEED_STRINGS_H to compile applications that think the
strcasecmp and strncasecmp functions are declared in /usr/include/string.h

These files are provided for reference and are not officially supported
by SCO. Use at your own risk.
