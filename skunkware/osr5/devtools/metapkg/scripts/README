The shell script "setup" can be used to expedite CDMT packaging on
OpenServer 6 with metapkg. It is currently deployed and used as follows:

- The setup shell script and prep.tar archive are installed in
  /v/legend/skunkware/

- Compressed tar archives of a project's distribution tree are stored
  in /v/legend/skunkware/dist/ with filenames like
  <package name>-<version number>-dist.tar.gz
  These are tar archives with relative pathnames from /

- Create an empty directory /v/legend/skunkware/<package name>
  and cd into that directory. Then run the setup script
      # ../setup
  The script will prompt you for a package description. I usually use
  the summary description of the package from freshmeat.net

- The setup script will create the necessary subdirectories, extract
  the distribution tree under the dist subdirectory, and populate the
  top-level directory with the mkcdmt file and some useful scripts.

- Edit the <package name>.mkcdmt file to add any special permissions,
  ownership, or exports.

- Run the MakeCDMT script followed, if successful, by "make".
