MetaPKG CDMT Backend Notes
==========================

This backend produces output for the Custom Distribution Mastering Toolkit,
or CDMT, the native packaging format for SCO OpenServer.

Command Line Options
====================

The CDMT backend adds one mandatory command linew option:
-E vendor
  Sets the text for the default CDMT `vendor'. This is used when ejecting
  all dependencies and pre-requisites.

The CDMT backend adds 4 optional command line options:

-H
  By default, the CDMT backend will convert symbolic links into additional
  `exportPath' entries for the target of the symbolic link. Under almost
  all circumstances, this will produce the most reliable package and
  provides the most useful information to the user. This option changes
  that default behaviour and will instead `harden' the symbolic links, by
  converting them into hard links, one file to another, using the LINK
  file type.

-h
  This option only has meaning if used in conjuction with the -H option
  described above. It further modifies the default handling of symbolic
  links by preventing them from being `hardened'. This will result in the
  backend producing true symbolic links in the package, using the SYML
  file type. This is almost always the wrong thing to do, as SYML records
  are handled poorly by custom, and not removed when the package that
  contains them is removed. There is almost no circumstance I can conceive
  of where you would need this, but the option is there if you discover one.

-l
  Usually, if MetaPKG encounters hard links in a package, it will eject a
  warning message that will prevent package generation unless the -W option
  is also specified. This is due to the fact that it is impossible to
  discern, from the filesystem, which of two hard links is the real primary
  file and which is the link to it. Using this option will allow you to
  silence that warning. However, you are encouraged to use the control
  file instead, and use the convert() directive for hard links. This option
  applies to all hard links encountered by MetaPKG. Using the control file,
  it is possible to silence the warning for a specific set of hard linked
  files using the linkok() function. This is the prefered approach.

-e
  The CDMT backend will, by default, produce input files that are as terse
  as possible, relying on the fact that the default mode, owner and group
  for files and directories are 0755/bin/bin for directories and 0444/bin/bin
  for normal files. The backend will produce files that define this, by
  setting the defaults in the config file. However, if you intend to use
  MetaPKG to generate CDMT input files that will then be used inside another
  package, perhaps with different defaults, then you can use this option
  to eject explicit mode, owner and group attributes for all files and
  directories. This produces more verbose, but more transportable files.
