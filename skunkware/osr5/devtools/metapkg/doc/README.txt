This is the source code for MetaPKG, a tool for creating CDMT and pkgadd
installable products.  This code represents a considerable rewrite of
mkcdmt, based on the experiences gathered during the first incarnation of
the tool.  The data model has been considerably simplified, and
consequently the code is cleaner and simpler, and should be easier to
maintain.

For command line usage, information on backend drivers and other
useful tidbits of information, see the files in the doc/ directory.

The source code for this program is available via CVS at
:pserver:anonymous@andes.pdev.sco.com:/cvs. Write access to the
server is available for any engineer who wants it. Contact jkj@sco.com
if you dont have write access and need it.
