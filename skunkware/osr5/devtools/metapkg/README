This directory contains MetaPKG, a program for creating CDMT and pkgadd
packages. The text files in ./doc explain its usage. The examples in
./examples may provide some assistance getting started.

MetaPKG binaries for OpenServer 6 can be found in ./osr6/
MetaPKG binaries for OpenServer 5 can be found in ./osr5/

To install this, copy the metapkg and reman binaries to a directory
in root's execution PATH and create symbolic links for mkcdmt and mkpkgadd:

	# ln -s metapkg mkcdmt  (OpenServer only)
	# ln -s metapkg mkpkgadd
