scripts/oa/
Programs to be interpreted by oash.  oash is a version of the Bourne shell
enhanced by SCO with their OA (Office Automation) libraries to do character
windowing stuff, kind of like wksh.  Versions of SCO UNIX starting with 3.2v4
shipped with oash.  In 3.2v4, it was in /usr/lib/scosh/utilbin/oash.  In 3.2v5,
it was moved to /usr/lib/oa/utilbin/oash.  These programs expect the latter
name; to run them on 3.2v4, just change the first line of each program, or
link oash to the new pathname.

Filename   Description
oafinger   Finds all users w/finger files & presents a them to pick/finger.
oatalk     Presents list of logged-in users on local or remote host to talk to.
oaw        Shows what users are doing (trivial).
oawho      Shows who is logged in; like stock oawho, but uses (& needs) 'flon'.

[ Note - For SCO Skunkware 97 i have changed these scripts to use
         /usr/lib/scosh/utilbin/oash as that is where oash is on my
         SCO OpenServer 5.0.2 and Kean's SCO OpenServer 5.0.4 systems.
