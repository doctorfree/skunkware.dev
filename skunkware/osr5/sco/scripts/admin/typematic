# 94/02/14 John H. DuBois III (john@armory.com)
# 96/09/16 Cleaned up.  Automatically create /dev/iob if it does not exist.

# Note: this program can be run with awk instead of gawk by swapping the first
# two lines (so the first one is '#!/usr/bin/awk -f').  
# In that case all option letters must be preceded by '+' instead of '-'.

# This program sets the typematic (autorepeat) rate of the PC/AT keyboard
# controller.  This is done by writing a command & value to the data port
# of the keyboard controller, using the access to the IO space provided by the
# the SCO UNIX mm driver.
# They keyboard controller is programmed as follows:
# Command port address: 0x64 (out)
# Status port address:  0x64 (in)
# Data port address:    0x60 (in/out)
# Commands may be written at any time.
# Status may be read at any time.
# Bit 0 of status is "output buffer full".
# Data may be written only when this bit is 0.
# Command byte 0xF3 is set typematic rate/delay.
# *NOTE* Even though it's a "command byte" it goes to the data port.
# After 0xF3 is written to the data port, a byte containing the delay and
# repeat rate values is written.  The bits of this byte have these meanings:
# 0ddeemmm   0 = always 0   d = delay   e = rate exponent   m = rate mantissa
# 7: always 0
# 5-6: Delay, 250..1000 mS.  Delay = (n + 1) * 250 mS +/- 20%
# 4-0: Typematic rate.  Rate is 1/period.  Period = (A+8)*(2^B)*4.17mS
#      B = bits 4-3, A = bits 2-0.
# Thus the range of rates is: 1/(15*8*4.17mS) = 2  through  1/(8*4.17mS) = 30
# Repeat clock: 1/4.17mS = 240 Hz

### Start of ProcArgs library
# @(#) ProcArgs 1.11 96/12/08
# 92/02/29 john h. dubois iii (john@armory.com)
# 93/07/18 Added "#" arg type
# 93/09/26 Do not count -h against MinArgs
# 94/01/01 Stop scanning at first non-option arg.  Added ">" option type.
#          Removed meaning of "+" or "-" by itself.
# 94/03/08 Added & option and *()< option types.
# 94/04/02 Added NoRCopt to Opts()
# 94/06/11 Mark numeric variables as such.
# 94/07/08 Opts(): Do not require any args if h option is given.
# 95/01/22 Record options given more than once.  Record option num in argv.
# 95/06/08 Added ExclusiveOptions().
# 96/01/20 Let rcfiles be a colon-separated list of filenames.
#          Expand $VARNAME at the start of its filenames.
#          Let varname=0 and -option- turn off an option.
# 96/05/05 Changed meaning of 7th arg to Opts; now can specify exactly how many
#          of the vars should be searched for in the environment.
#          Check for duplicate rcfiles.
# 96/05/13 Return more specific error values.  Note: ProcArgs() and InitOpts()
#          now return various negatives values on error, not just -1, and
#          Opts() may set Err to various positive values, not just 1.
#          Added AllowUnrecOpt.
# 96/05/23 Check type given for & option
# 96/06/15 Re-port to awk
# 96/10/01 Moved file-reading code into ReadConfFile(), so that it can be
#          used by other functions.
# 96/10/15 Added OptChars
# 96/11/01 Added exOpts arg to Opts()
# 96/11/16 Added ; type
# 96/12/08 Added Opt2Set() & Opt2Sets()
# 96/12/27 Added CmdLineOpt()

# optlist is a string which contains all of the possible command line options.
# A character followed by certain characters indicates that the option takes
# an argument, with type as follows:
# :	String argument
# ;	Non-empty string argument
# *	Floating point argument
# (	Non-negative floating point argument
# )	Positive floating point argument
# #	Integer argument
# <	Non-negative integer argument
# >	Positive integer argument
# The only difference the type of argument makes is in the runtime argument
# error checking that is done.

# The & option is a special case used to get numeric options without the
# user having to give an option character.  It is shorthand for [-+.0-9].
# If & is included in optlist and an option string that begins with one of
# these characters is seen, the value given to "&" will include the first
# char of the option.  & must be followed by a type character other than ":"
# or ";".
# Note that if e.g. &> is given, an option of -.5 will produce an error.

# Strings in argv[] which begin with "-" or "+" are taken to be
# strings of options, except that a string which consists solely of "-"
# or "+" is taken to be a non-option string; like other non-option strings,
# it stops the scanning of argv and is left in argv[].
# An argument of "--" or "++" also stops the scanning of argv[] but is removed.
# If an option takes an argument, the argument may either immediately
# follow it or be given separately.
# "-" and "+" options are treated the same.  "+" is allowed because most awks
# take any -options to be arguments to themselves.  gawk 2.15 was enhanced to
# stop scanning when it encounters an unrecognized option, though until 2.15.5
# this feature had a flaw that caused problems in some cases.  See the OptChars
# parameter to explicitly set the option-specifier characters.

# If an option that does not take an argument is given,
# an index with its name is created in Options and its value is set to the
# number of times it occurs in argv[].

# If an option that does take an argument is given, an index with its name is
# created in Options and its value is set to the value of the argument given
# for it, and Options[option-name,"count"] is (initially) set to the 1.
# If an option that takes an argument is given more than once,
# Options[option-name,"count"] is incremented, and the value is assigned to
# the index (option-name,instance) where instance is 2 for the second occurance
# of the option, etc.
# In other words, the first time an option with a value is encountered, the
# value is assigned to an index consisting only of its name; for any further
# occurances of the option, the value index has an extra (count) dimension.

# The sequence number for each option found in argv[] is stored in
# Options[option-name,"num",instance], where instance is 1 for the first
# occurance of the option, etc.  The sequence number starts at 1 and is
# incremented for each option, both those that have a value and those that
# do not.  Options set from a config file have a value of 0 assigned to this.

# Options and their arguments are deleted from argv.
# Note that this means that there may be gaps left in the indices of argv[].
# If compress is nonzero, argv[] is packed by moving its elements so that
# they have contiguous integer indices starting with 0.
# Option processing will stop with the first unrecognized option, just as
# though -- was given except that unlike -- the unrecognized option will not be
# removed from ARGV[].  Normally, an error value is returned in this case.
# If AllowUnrecOpt is true, it is not an error for an unrecognized option to
# be found, so the number of remaining arguments is returned instead.
# If OptChars is not a null string, it is the set of characters that indicate
# that an argument is an option string if the string begins with one of the
# characters.  A string consisting solely of two of the same option-indicator
# characters stops the scanning of argv[].  The default is "-+".
# argv[0] is not examined.
# The number of arguments left in argc is returned.
# If an error occurs, the global string OptErr is set to an error message
# and a negative value is returned.
# Current error values:
# -1: option that required an argument did not get it.
# -2: argument of incorrect type supplied for an option.
# -3: unrecognized (invalid) option.

# If EnvSearch is given and nonzero, the first EnvSearch variables will also be
# searched for in the environment.  If set to -1, all values will be searched
# for in the environment.  Values given in the environment will override
# those given in the rcfiles but not those given on the command line.
# NoRCopt, if given, is an additional letter option that if given on the
# command line prevents the rcfiles from being read.
# See ProcArgs() for a description of AllowUnRecOpt and optChars, and
# ExclusiveOptions() for a description of exOpts.
# Special options:
# If x is made an option and is given, some debugging info is output.
# h is assumed to be the help option.

# Global variables:
# The command line arguments are taken from ARGV[].
# The arguments that are option specifiers and values are removed from
# ARGV[], leaving only ARGV[0] and the non-option arguments.
# The number of elements in ARGV[] should be in ARGC.
# After processing, ARGC is set to the number of elements left in ARGV[].
# The option values are put in Options[].
# On error, Err is set to a positive integer value so it can be checked for in
# an END block.
# Return value: The number of elements left in ARGV is returned.
# Must keep OptErr global since it may be set by InitOpts().

# ReadConfFile(): Read a file containing var/value assignments, in the form
# <variable-name><assignment-char><value>.
# Whitespace (spaces and tabs) around a variable (leading whitespace on the
# line and whitespace between the variable name and the assignment character) 
# is stripped.  Lines that do not contain an assignment operator or which
# contain a null variable name are ignored, other than possibly being noted in
# the return value.  If more than one assignment is made to a variable, the
# first assignment is used.
# Input variables:
# File is the file to read.
# Comment is the line-comment character.  If it is found as the first non-
#     whitespace character on a line, the line is ignored.
# Assign is the assignment string.  The first instance of Assign on a line
#     separates the variable name from its value.
# If StripWhite is true, whitespace around the value (whitespace between the
#     assignment char and trailing whitespace on the line) is stripped.
# VarPat is a pattern that variable names must match.  
#     Example: "^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]+$"
# If FlagsOK is true, variables are allowed to be "set" by being put alone on
#     a line; no assignment operator is needed.  These variables are set in
#     the output array with a null value.  Lines containing nothing but
#     whitespace are still ignored.
# Output variables:
# Values[] contains the assignments, with the indexes being the variable names
#     and the values being the assigned values.
# Lines[] contains the line number that each variable occured on.  A flag set
#     is record by giving it an index in Lines[] but not in Values[].
# Return value:
# If any errors occur, a string consisting of descriptions of the errors
# separated by newlines is returned.  In no case will the string start with a
# numeric value.  If no errors occur,  the number of lines read is returned.
