* @(#) atdialT3K 1.0 95/10/21
* atdialer default file for Telebit T3000
* Tested for rackmount version; probably will work for standalone modems too.
* 95/10/21 John H. DuBois III (john@armory.com)
* This dialer sets the modem to use a fixed DTE speed, with the modem doing
* Baud rate conversion.  
* To change the DTE speed, change the value that S51 is set to.
* If the modem is on an enabled tty line (set for dialin), the fixed DTE speed
* set here MUST match the speed that getty is set for (as determined by the
* gettydefs entry chosen by the gettydefs tag passed to getty, configured in
* the inittab file).

*&F	Load factory default 'tty' configuration.
*&C1	CD follows carrier
*&D2	Hang up on DTR low
*X12	result code reflects DTE speed
*&Q	use asynchronous communication
*E	disable command echo
*M	speaker disabled
*Q	report result codes
*S0=1	Answer after 1 ring
*S2=043	set escape char to +
*S45=0	disable remote access to modem config
*S46=0	disable callback security.  Password required to set this register.
*S50=0	automatic modem speed determination
*S51=5	set speed after connect to 19200
*S51=6	set speed after connect to 38400
*S58=2	use RTS/CTS flow control for data from modem
*S61=0	do not enter command mode on break
*S63=0	send break to remote system within data sequence
*S68=255	use same flow control as s58 specifies for data to modem
*S94=1	connect at any speed
*S104=0	disable autodialing
*S180=2	use v42 error control with detection phase
*S181=1	if no error control can be negotiated, use buffered/flow control mode
*S190=1	allow data compression in both directions
*T	tone dialing
*V1	english result codes
*Y	do not respond to long space disconnect
*Z	reset.  Any further commands on the same line are ignored.
