admin/mmdf/
MMDF administrative utilities.  These were written for SCO XENIX and SCO UNIX,
but most should be portable to other flavors of UNIX without too much trouble.
If you don't have ksh for the #!/bin/ksh scripts, try pd-ksh, bash, or zsh.
Many of them require gawk, version 2.15.5 or later.  Some require gawk 3.0.0
or later.  A gawk 3.0.0 binary for SCO 5.0 can be found in the scobins/
directory. 
These utilities are for the MMDF mail transport agent, as shipped with SCO
UNIX and used by many sites as a replacement for shipped mail systems.
