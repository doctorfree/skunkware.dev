# fb: invoke bc with scale=10
# bc will not take commands on command line, only the names of files to
# read commands from.
# The following starts a subshell with fd 3 dupped from fd 0 (stdin)
# so that the scale command can be piped to bc on fd 0 and then further
# commands read from the standard input of fb on fd 3.
# The standard input to bc (the scale command) is dupped to fd 4 and
# put on the command line as /dev/fd/4 so that it will be read first;
# fd 0 is then dupped from fd 3, where fb's standard input was preserved.
#alias fb='( echo "scale = 10" | bc /dev/fd/0 /dev/fd/3 ) 3<&0'
