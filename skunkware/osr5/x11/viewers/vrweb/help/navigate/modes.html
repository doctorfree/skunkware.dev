This page describes the navigation modes of VRweb. You can switch
among them by pressing the appropriate button in the <A
href="../basics.html#toolbar">toolbar</A> or using the <i>accelerator keys F4
- F8</i>.
<p>
Every time you switch the navigation mode you get a short one-line
message in the status line describing the functions of the mode. If
the line is too long for reading you can scroll it with the
<i>middle</i> mouse button.
<p>
Note: If your mouse has no 3rd button, the mouse driver of your
X-server will emulate the middle one when pressing both mouse buttons
simultaneously.
<p>
For complementary navigation tools and options see page <A
HREF="index.html">Navigation Techniques</A>.

<A name="flip">
<H2>Flip Mode</H2>
<p>
Use the <b>flip</b> mode for examination of objects. You manipulate
the object whereas the viewpoint remains stationary.
<p>
<UL>
<LI>The <i>left</i> mouse button controls <i>translation</i>.<br>The
object will follow the mouse cursor.
<p>
<LI>The <i>middle</i> mouse button controls <i>rotation</i>.<br>You
can rotate the object horizontally and vertically. All rotations are
performed around the center of the object.
<p>
<LI>The <i>right</i> mouse button is used for <i>zooming</i>.<br>Drag
it down to zoom in (move object towards you) or up to zoom out.
</UL>
<p>
Tip: To examine details of objects use the <b><A
HREF="modes.html#flyto">fly to</A></b> tool. After having set a point
of interest, it serves as roation center with <i>control+middle</i>
mouse button in flip mode.
<p>
You may also rotate around the center of the selected object
(shift+click) by dragging with <i>shift+middle</i> mouse button in
flip mode.
<p>
<HR>
<p>
<A name="walk">
<H2>Walk Mode</H2>
<p>
The <b>walk</b> mode is designed for navigation in scenes. Beginners
may prefer to use the <b><A HREF="modes.html#headsup">heads up</A></b>
mode instead. The point where you press the mouse button is marked by
a cross and is used as the origin for speed controls (unless you turn
off the option <i>velocity control</i>).
<p>
<UL>
<LI>The <i>left</i> mouse button is used for walking
<i>forwards/backwards</i> by dragging the mouse up or down, in
combination with a <i>sideways</i> motion to the left or right.
<p>
<LI>The <i>middle</i> mouse button is used for <i>up and down</i>
motion (elevation/delevation) and <i>sideways</i> stepping.
<p>
<LI>The <i>right</i> mouse button is used to turn the view. You can
<i>turn your eyes</i> up and down and to the sides. It also determines
the direction of subsequent navigation.
</UL>
<p>
<HR>
<p>
<A name="fly">
<H2>Fly Mode</H2>
<p>
The <b>fly</b> mode simulates flying through the world with an
aeroplane. The bar on the right side indicates your current flying
speed, the position of the airplane cursor relative to the cross in
the middle indicates your flight direction.
<p>
<UL>
<LI>The <i>left</i> mouse button is used for <i>starting and
stopping</i> the flight. To start flying, press the mouse button in
the center region of the cross. It is possible to stop anywhere,
causing the speed to be set back to zero.
<p>
<LI>The <i>middle and right</i> mouse buttons are used for <i>speed
control</i>. Press the middle mouse button to increase speed and the
right one to decrease speed. As long as your speed is zero you turn
your direction without changing your viewing position. Flying backward
is possible by decreasing the speed below zero.
<p>
<LI>The <i>flight direction</i> is controlled by the position of the
<i>mouse cursor</i>. As long as you keep the mouse within the center
region you will fly in a straight line.
</UL>
<p>
<HR>
<p>
<A name="headsup">
<H2>Heads Up</H2>
<p>
The <b>heads up</b> mode is very simple to use. Icons superimposed on
the scene show you the possible actions. All navigation can be done
using the left mouse button only. Drag the mouse out of an icon and
you perform the appropriate motion.
<p>
<UL>
<LI>The <i>eyes</i> icon controls the viewing direction. Use it to
<i>turn your eyes</i> up and down and to the sides.
<p>
<LI>The <i>body</i> icon is used for <i>walking</i> through the scene. Up/down
corresponds to forward and backward motion, combined with sideward motion
to the left or right.
<p>
<LI>The <i>arrows</i> icon is used for <i>up and down</i> motion
(elevation/delevation) and <i>sideways</i> stepping.
<p>
<LI>The <i>cross hair</i> icon is used to activate the <b>fly to</b>
mode temporarily (indicated by a change of the cursor shape). You can
switch back to heads up with a <i>double click</i>.
</UL>
<p>
If you get more experienced (or if you find the icons annoying), the
<b><A HREF="modes.html#walk">walk</A></b> mode offers you the same
possibilities: walking (left), panning (middle), and looking (right).
<p>
<HR>
<p>
<A name="flyto">
<H2>Fly To</H2>
<p>
The <b>fly to</b> mode is an additional tool for examining details in
the scene. A point of interest can be approached rapidly but in a
controlled manner. The target point can also be used as rotation
center for the <b><A HREF="modes.html#flip">flip</A></b> mode.
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Set the <i>point of interest</i> by clicking in the scene with the
<i>left</i> mouse button. The target point will be indicated with a
cross hair. You can also drag the mouse to move the point of interest
around.
<p>
<LI>Use the <i>middle or right</i> mouse button to move <i>towards or
away from</i> the point of interest respectively. The motion is done
logarithmically for fast and controlled approach as long as you hold
down the mouse button. You stop motion by releasing the mouse button.
<p>
<LI>Hold the <i>shift key</i> together with the middle mouse button to
approach the surface on the normal vector. You arrive looking straight
into the point of interest. Move back the same way using the right
mouse button.
<p>
<LI>Hold the <i>control key</i> to perform a rotation only. You
gradually get a view where the point of interest is centered on the
window, looking straight onto the surface, and keeping the original
distance from it constant.
</UL>
<p>
Tip: scene creators interested in actual 3D coordinates may hold down
the <i>meta</i> (alt) key while setting the point of interest; the
coordinate and normal vector of the hitpoint are written to the
terminal (world coordinate system).
