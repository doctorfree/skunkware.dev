<p>
VRweb offers 5 modes for navigation in scenes, each of which is
described on its own page. The mode can be selected by pressing the
appropriate <i>button in the toolbar</i>, via the Navigate menu, or by
using shortcuts.
<p>
<UL>
<LI><b>Flip</b> <i>(accelerator key F4)</i><br>is used for examining
objects, whilst the viewer remains stationary.
<p>
<LI><b>Walk</b> <i>(accelerator key F5)</i><br>is used for strolling
through a 3D environment.
<p>
<LI><b>Fly</b> <i>(accelerator key F6)</i><br>is like piloting an
aircraft.
<p>
<LI><b>Fly to</b> <i>(accelerator key F7)</i><br>is a tool for
controlled approach to a point of interest.
<p>
<LI><b>Heads Up</b> <i>(accelerator key F8)</i><br>is an easy to use
navigation method for moving around in a scene by use of control
icons.

<UL>
<LI><b>List of predefined viewpoints</b>
<p>
VRML offers the possibility of multiple predefined viewpoints. You can
select one of them in the Viewpoints pullright menu. After you select
one, its name is also displayed in the status line.
<p>
With the <i>accelerator keys PgUp, PgDn</i> (sometimes labeled Prev,
Next) you jump to the previous and next viewpoint. Up to nine
viewpoints (camera numbers start with 1) can be accessed via the
<i>accelerator keys 1 to 9 (digits)</i>.
<p>
<LI><b>Reset View</b> <i>(accelerator key r)</i>
<p>
This is your "emergency exit" if you get lost in hyperspace. Select
this function and you will be brought back to the initial view. In
case of multiple viewpoints you go back to the most recently selected
one.
<p>
<LI><b>Level View</b> <i>(accelerator key l)</i>
<p>
This function makes your view parallel to the ground plane, i.e. shows
a view where you are no longer looking up or down or tilted.
<p>
<LI><b>Untilt View</b> <i>(accelerator key u)</i>
<p>
This function makes your view untilted. If you wish to explore worlds
without ever tilting your head, you can control this with an option
(see below).
<p>
<LI><b>View Selection</b> <i>(accelerator key s)</i>
<p>
This tool makes the selected object (in normal viewing mode, objects
are selected with <i>shift+click</i> with the left mouse button)
visible in the center of the window.
<p>
<LI><b>View World</b> <i>(accelerator key w)</i>
<p>
This tool calculates a view to show the whole scene (or VRML "world")
in the browser window (the same is done if the scene does not define
an initial viewpoint).

<H2>Navigation Options</H2>
<p>
<UL>
<LI><b>Enable Motion with Anchors</b>
<p>
When turned on, you can still navigate when anchor highlighting is
turned on. You have to double-click (or ctrl-click) <A
HREF="../anchors.html#anchors">anchors</A> to activate them in this
case.
<p>
When turned off, you may activate anchors with a single mouse click when
highlighted, however, navigation is disabled in this case.
<p>
<LI><b>Velocity Control</b>
<p>
When enabled, mouse draggings in <i>walk</i> and <i>heads up</i> mode
correspond to speed changes, which gives very convenient control. When
disabled, draggings are directly mapped to motions.
<p>
<LI><b>Free Rotation Control</b>
<p>
This allows you to tilt the view of the scene or the scene itself when
enabled. Disable it if you wish to keep an upright view.
<p>
<LI><b>Collision Detection</b>
<p>
With collision detection activated, you are prevented from "flying
through walls". This imposes a small computational overhead, but gives
a much more realistic feeling while exploring virtual worlds. You will
also notice that you slide along walls when approaching them on moving
forward/backward (you won't just stop).

<H2>Navigation Settings</H2>
<p>
This dialog allows setting of various navigation constants. Use the
sliders or field editors to change the settings. Press the <b>OK</b>
button to accept the new values. Use the <b>Reset</b> button to return
to the default settings, and the <b>Cancel</b> button to restore the
previously set values. The <b>Help</b> button brings you to this help
page.
<p>
<UL>
<LI><b>Collision Distance</b>
<p>
This is the distace you are kept away from objects when collision
detecion is turned on (see above).
<p>
<LI><b>Navigation Speed Factor</b>
<p>
This value allows an overall acceleration or deceleration in all
movement metaphors. It represents a factor multiplied to your mouse
movements. On fast machines you may want to decrease this value, on
slow machines or large scenes you may want to increase it.
<p>
<LI><b>Fly To: Zoom Speed</b>
<LI><b>Fly To: Rotation Speed</b>
<p>
These two values control the speed in mode <i><A
HREF="modes.html#flyto">fly to</A></i>. They represent the fraction of
motion towards the point of interest per frame. It is recommended to
set the rotation value a bit larger than the zoom value to get an
appropriate motion curve.
<p>
<LI><b>Quadrics Complexity</b>
<p>
This option sets the number of slices into which spheres, cylinders,
and cones are split on rendering. The higher the number the smoother
those objects will appear (also their outlines), but the more time it
takes for drawing. The value gets effective on next scene redraw. This
option does not really concern navigation and may move elsewhere in a
future release.
<p>
<LI><b>SV-BSP recalculation</b>
<p>
This option gives the number of frames for the Shadow Volume <A
href="../display.html#rendering">BSP Tree</A>, which should be
rendered using current visibility information, before they must be
recalculated. These recalculations take some time, but in the
intermediate frames you may get holes caused by polygons previously
out of view.
<p>
<LI><b>Stereo: Convergence Plane</b>
<p>
This value determines at which depth the <A
href="../display.html#stereo">stereo</A> image pair converges. It is
given as fraction of the far clipping plane. The default value causes
convergence in middle of the scene. Smaller values move the virtual
image away from you.
<p>
<LI><b>Stereo: Eye distance</b>
<p>
The half eye distance in window coordinates. Larger values increase
the stereo effect, but are harder to focus (you'll also notice visual
distortions when rotating the scene or moving your head). Values near
0.0 will reduce the stereo effect.

<A name="spaceball"></A>
<H2>Spaceball Control</H2>
<p>
Note: Settings made in this dialog are only effective when you have a
spaceball connected to your machine. Spaceball support is currently
compiled into the SGI binary and available in the source code. If you
have a spaceball connected to another machine, please compile the
source code yourself or contact the VRweb team.
<p>
Spaceball buttons <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> toggle Translation and
Rotation. Button <b>3</b> toggles the Single Axis Filter, performing
either a translation or rotation along the dominant axis (recommended
for beginners). The spaceball device will beep on turning on any of
these options. Note that the buttons have no effect when no scene is
currently loaded.
<p>
Button <b>4</b> switches between the <i>flip</i> and <i>walk</i>
metaphor. The first one manipulates the object, the second one
controls the viewpoint in the scene.
<p>
Buttons <b>5</b> to <b>7</b> control the sensitivity, which is also
displayed in the dialog. Button 5 halfs the sensitivity, button 6
doubles it, and button 7 resets it to the default value.
<p>
Button <b>8</b> rezeros the spaceball. You can also achieve constant
motion by twisting the spaceball, pressing button 8 and then releasing
it. Press button 8 again to stop.
<p>
Finally, the push button <b>P</b> on the back side of the ball resets
the view.

<LI><b>Hold</b> <i>(accelerator key H)</i>
<p>
This function of the Navigate menu is used to hold the current
window. I.e. the current scene is prevented from being replaced by
another one - even when you configured VRweb to use a single window
for successive scenes (<A HREF="../install.html#config">remote</A>
call).
