VRweb 1.1 includes WWWAnchor support for Netscape and Mosaic. With
command line argument <code>-mosaic</code>, VRweb chooses Mosaic,
otherwise it will assume Netscape. In both cases an instance of the
web browser must be running to accept requests.
<p>
For <b>Netscape</b>, the binary must be found under the name
<code>netscape</code> and run on your X-Display, however it does
neither has to run on the same machine nor share a file system with
VRweb.
<p>
For NCSA <b>Mosaic</b> you must select a CCI port number in Menu
File/CCI of Mosaic. Enter a port number between 1024 and 65535 and
mark the item "select requests". Communication from VRweb to Mosaic
will be done through this port, the name of the Mosaic binary does not
matter.
<p>
The <b>Harmony</b> version supports both WWWAnchor and WWWInline
without special settings.
<p>
To use a <b>proxy</b> host for WWWinline/Texture requests, specify
host:port (e.g. <code>myproxy:8000</code>) via command line argument
<code>-proxy</code> or Xattribute <code>proxy</code>. If you are using
Netscape, take the values for HTTP Proxy and Port listed under
Options | Network Preferences | Proxies | Manual Config | View...

<H2>Anchors</H2>
<p>
Anchors are activated with a <b>double-click</b> or
<b>ctrl-click</b>. Whereas ctrl-click works in all modes, double-click
is disabled during the fly-to navigation tool to prevent unintended
link activation.
<p>
A single click on anchors highlights them and shows the description
and destination URL in the <A HREF="basics.html#statusline">status
line</A>. Click anywhere outside anchors to remove the selection box.
<p>
Anchor highlighting can be turned on and off with the <i>Anchors
button</i> in the <A href="basics.html#toolbar">toolbar</A>. It is
not necessary to have anchor highlighting turned on to follow
links.<br><I>Accelerator key: F9.</I>
<p>
If you prefer anchor activation with single mouse clicks, disable the
option "Enable Motion with Anchors" in the Navigate menu. This causes
a single click to follow links while anchors are highlighted.
<p>
There are two anchor highlighting methods available: <b>color code</b>
and <b>brightness</b>. They can be chosen in the Anchors submenu of
the Display menu. Color code draws anchors in a specific color
(red-brown) by default, and non-anchors in a shade of grey. Brightness
shows anchors brighter than non-anchors.

<A name="inlines">
<H2>Inlines</H2>
<p>
WWWInline nodes are fetched sequentially (on encountering them, can be
inside an LOD to defer loading) directly by VRweb via HTTP or via a
proxy. <A HREF="display.html#texturing">Textures</A> are loaded the
same way, in case texture mapping is turned on.
<p>
The progress indicator of the <A
HREF="basics.html#statusline">statusline</A> shows the connection
state (connect or transfer) together with the URL of the inlined data,
and (if already known) the total size of data to be transferred. The
transfer can be interrupted at any time pressing the stop button.
<p>
Inline data are gunzipped automatically, redirects are handled,
relative URLs are handled properly.
<p>
VRweb needs the -URL argument to be able to resolve relative
URLs. Only absolute URLs can be handled otherwise. Relative URLs will
be searched on the local file system in this case. Any attempt for
downloads from the Web can be suppressed with the <A
HREF="custom.html">command line</A> option "-local".
