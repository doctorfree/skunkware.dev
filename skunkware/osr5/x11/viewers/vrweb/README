Description
     VRweb is a freely available browser for 3D worlds and scenes modeled in
     VRML (the Virtual Reality Modeling Language). It was developed by the
     Institute for Information Processing and Computer Supported New Media
     (IICM) of Graz University of Technology, Austria.  For information about
     the IICM, visit "http://www.iicm.edu/".  VRweb is the only free VRML
     browser available in full source code which does not require commercial
     packages such as Inventor or Motif and which will run on (almost) any
     Unix or Windows platform.
Productivity
     This program displays VRML 1.0 files for the user to manipulate. When
     used with a web browser, such as Netscape or Mosaic, this 3D viewer
     allows access to the increasing number of web sites offering virtual
     reality content and to the advanced HyperWave servers (formerly known
     as "Hyper-G"). HyperWave servers represent the next generation web
     solution for publishing rich hypermedia documents in the Internet's
     World Wide Web and internal TCP/IP networks. For more information about
     HyperWave, visit "http://www.hyperwave.de/".
Work Planned
     None
Documentation
     To view the VRweb User Guide, visit "http://www.iicm.edu/vrweb/help".
Verification
     Run "vrweb-mesa filename &", where filename is any VRML 1.0 file.  If
     VRwave (the Java successor to VRweb) is available, it will be invoked to
     view VRML 2.0 files.  Both VRML 1.0 and VRML 2.0 files have a file
     suffix of ".wrl"  VRwave can be obtained from SCO Skunkware.  For more
     information on VRwave, visit "http://www.iicm.edu/vrwave".

How to get the source

Visit "http://www.sco.com/skunkware/src/x11/viewers" or
"ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/src/x11/viewers" to obtain a copy of the
source in gzip format. To create the executable from the source code (on 
SCO OpenServer 5.0.4), follow these steps:

   * Install the SCO OpenServer Development System (for the X window "imake"
     facility).  I used version 5.1.0Ac.
   * Install the Perl scripting language and the GNU Development System
     (for the C++ compiler).  Both are available from SCO Skunkware.  I
     used GNU 95.4c and Perl 5.003.
   * Use csh (not ksh).
   * Ensure that the execution search path includes the directory containing
     the GNU C/C++ compilers (e.g., "/usr/progressive/bin" for the Skunkware
     version) BEFORE any other compiler directories (e.g., "/usr/bin/" for
     the SCO Development System compilers).
   * Execute the command: "setenv CPU SCO".
   * See file INSTALLATION for an installation guide.
   * The unbuilt source directory hierarchy requires about 18 Meg, and the
     built hierarchy requires about 50 Meg of disk space.  The unstripped
     binary is under 5 Meg.
