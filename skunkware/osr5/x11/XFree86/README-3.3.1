This is a binary only version of XFree86 3.3.1. This is the first
port of XFree86 to SCO Open Server, and is considered very experimental.

To extract this file, perform the following steps, as root:
  # cd /usr
  # gzcat xfree86-3.3.1.OSR5.tar.gz | tar xvf -

Then set your PATH to include /usr/X11R6/bin *BEFORE* any other X11 related
directories, and then simply run XF86Setup to set it all up. Please
report any problems with this package directly to me, jkj@sco.com.
