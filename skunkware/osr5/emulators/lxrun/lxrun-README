    These are some basic Linux libraries that you'll need
to get started with lxrun.  The source and pre-compiled
binaries for these files is available from:

    ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/

                    and

    ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/GCC/


To use these libraries:

    1. Install these files in /usr/local/linux/lib.

    2. Move ld.so.cache to /etc.

    3. Set the environment variable LINUX_ROOT to /usr/local/linux.

This should get lxrun working for simple Linux binaries.

To run more complicated programs, you will probably need
some more libraries.  These can either be taken directly
from a running Linux system, or you can point your web
browser at the Sunsite Linux archive:

    http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/welcome.html

Install any new libraries in /usr/local/linux/lib.
