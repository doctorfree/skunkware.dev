This directory, /usr/local/linux/bin, is intended as the repository
for Linux binaries which are to be run using lxrun. We have provided
a Bourne shell script front-end to lxrun called lxfront in this directory.

To utilize lxfront, after placing the Linux binary which you wish to run
in this directory (e.g. /usr/local/linux/bin/raplayer), create a symbolic
link in your default execution search path to the lxfront script.

For example, after placing the Linux raplayer binary in /usr/local/linux/bin,
run the command (as root) :

    # cd /usr/local/bin
    # ln -s /usr/local/linux/bin/lxfront raplayer

You should now be able to simply run raplayer from the command line
as you would normally. The lxfront shell script sets up your environment
and executes lxrun with the appropriate arguments. In the example above,
assuming /usr/local/bin is in your search path, you need only type
"raplayer" at the shell prompt to run the Linux Real Audio player.

You do not need to use lxfront to front-end the execution of lxrun.
It is provided as a convenience.
