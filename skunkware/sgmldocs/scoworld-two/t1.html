>Much of the most useful and popular software today is published and
distributed in source form. The Apache web server, KDE, the Mtools DOS
utilities and the GNU C compiler are a few examples of what is commonly 
referred to as Open Source software. This article attempts to provide some 
insight, tips, techniques and methodology for building Open Source software 
on and for <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>SCO OpenServer 5</SPAN
>,
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>UnixWare 7</SPAN

software is the creation of an appropriate build environment. Fortunately,
on <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>SCO OpenServer 5</SPAN
> and 
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>UnixWare 7</SPAN
>, much of the work has already been done
for you. On either platform, simply install the base Operating System,
native development system, Java Development Kit and the SCO Skunkware CD 
included in the Operating System media kit. </P

>If you are not a licensed Development System user you can still build an 
appropriate development environment by utilizing the GNU development system
along with the native libraries and headers. On
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>OpenServer</SPAN
> you will need to
install the "Linkers and Application Libraries" package of the Development
System (no license key is required). On either platform you can simply install
the Development System sans license key.</P
><P
>After having installed the Operating System, development system of choice,
and SCO Skunkware you will now have access to the standard tools necessary
to build most Open Source packages. These tools include the GNU Compiler
Collection, Bison, Flex, GNU Make, autoconf, automake, and a wide variety
of header files and libraries.</P

>Another method for obtaining access to the very latest development
sources for many Open Source projects is Anonymous CVS. After installing
SCO Skunkware you will have the necessary CVS utilities in 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/bin</TT
>.
To download a project's source tree via CVS, login to the CVS server
with the project password, checkout the desired source, and logout. The
project home page will supply you with the CVS server name and password
if they are maintaining an anonymous CVS source repository.
I've written a script to automate this procedure for several projects.
You can download this script via

>Configuring Open Source Software for Compilation</A
></H4
><P
>After identifying an Open Source package of interest, locating it, and 
downloading the source archive it is typically the case that the source
needs to be unpacked and configured for your platform. Most source archives
downloadable over the Internet are compressed tar archives. To extract
on of these, say <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>widget-1.0.tar.gz</TT
>, issue the command:
<P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gzcat&nbsp;widget-1.0.tar.gz&nbsp;|&nbsp;tar&nbsp;xf&nbsp;-</P
>
It is often prudent to first simply list the contents of the archive
to determine if it extracts into it's own subdirectory. If not, create
a subdirectory and extract the archive from there.</P
><P
>Once extracted the source project needs to be configured for your platform.
Most modern Open Source projects use GNU Autoconf to provide configuration
scripts which attempt to automate the configuration process. In the simplest
cases it will only be necessary to run the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
> 
script:
<P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cd&nbsp;widget-1.0&nbsp;;&nbsp;./configure</P
></P
><P
>Unfortunately, it is often necessary to "help" <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
> 
understand your platform. For instance, on 
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>UnixWare 7</SPAN
> it is sometimes 
necessary to:
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>replace configure's "-lnsl" with "-lsocket -lnsl"</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>replace configure's "-lICE" with "-lSM -lICE"</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>order "-lSM -lICE" after "-lXt" but prior to "-lX11" on the link line</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>rearrange the order of certain graphics libraries like JPEG, TIFF, 
PNG or others</P
></LI
></UL
>
A typical link line for a graphical application might include:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>-L/usr/local/lib -lXpm -ltiff -ljpeg -lpng -lz -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lSM -lICE -lXext -lX11 -lm -lsocket -lnsl -lgen</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
Many of these idiosyncracies, due in part to the single-pass nature of
the native linker, can be simply accomodated by 
rerunning autoconf which regenerates the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
>
script from the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure.in</TT
> file for your platform.</P
><P
>Another configuration area that often causes problems is the building of
shared libraries. The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ltconfig</TT
> script contains the 
platform-specific instructions and options for creating shared libraries. 
In order to build shared libraries on <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>UnixWare 7</SPAN
> 
it is necessary to modify <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ltconfig</TT
> and add the following
to the appropriate case statements:

<TABLE

></TABLE
></P
><P
>By default, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
> will use the GNU C Compiler.
If you wish to use an alternate compiler the CC environment variable can
be set appropriately. On <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>UnixWare 7</SPAN
> the Skunkware
components are built with the native compiler for performance and portability
reasons. As a convenience i've constructed simple shell scripts to front-end 
the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
> script. For instance, on UnixWare 7 to use
the native C compiler:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>#!/bin/sh
HOST=i586-sco-sysv5
[ -f mout-config ] &#38;&#38; mv mout-config mout-config$$
CC="cc"
CPP="$CC -E"
CFLAGS="-Xa -Dasm=__asm -DANSICPP -O3 -Kthread -Kalloca -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib"
CXX="CC"
CXXFLAGS="-O3 -I/usr/local/include/stl -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib"
RANLIB=true
MAKE=/usr/local/bin/make
export CC CPP CXX RANLIB MAKE CFLAGS CXXFLAGS
./configure $* $HOST 2&#62;&#38;1 | tee mout-config</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
Note the use of "-Kthread -Kalloca". These enable threads and the built-in
alloca function. The check for threads support in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
> often fails on UnixWare 7. If you wish to
include threads support it may be necessary to modify
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
> and/or <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>config.h</TT
>.
On <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>SCO OpenServer</SPAN
> the use of threads can be
accomplished via the FSU Pthreads package on Skunkware. To use FSU Pthreads
the application should include &lt;pthread.h&gt; and link with the
"-lgthreads" linker option.</P
><P
>After running the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
> script it is a good idea to 
examine the output which is stored in the file config.log. You may also need 
to edit the generated <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>config.h</TT
>, if any. Running
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
> with a tee to a log file
<P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./configure&nbsp;|&nbsp;tee&nbsp;mout-config</P
>
will allow you to examine both the config.log and mout-config for possible 
errors in the configuration.</P
><P
>Many programs use the Imake system to configure the source for a particular
platform. These will have an <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Imakefile</TT
> which is used to 
generate the Makefile. To configure such a source hierarchy for compilation 
on your system simply run:
<P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xmkmf&nbsp;-a</P

>Compiling Open Source Software</A
></H4
><P
>Once configured properly most Open Source software can be compiled
by simply running "make". I use GNU make almost exclusively due to its
widespread use in the Open Source community and the incompatibilities
with System V make and different feature set. To be sure
you are using GNU make rather than System V make, place 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/bin</TT
> prior to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/bin</TT
> or 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/bin</TT
> in your execution path. For example:
<P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;export&nbsp;PATH</P
>
To generate a logfile of the output from your compile, make can be piped 
to a tee as follows:
<P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make&nbsp;2&gt;&#38;1&nbsp;|&nbsp;tee&nbsp;mout</P
>
After successfully compiling the source files and reviewing the logfiles
many Makefiles include a "test" or "check" rule which runs any included
automated tests. To run these, issue the command:
<P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make&nbsp;test&nbsp;2&gt;&#38;1&nbsp;|&nbsp;tee&nbsp;mout-test<br>
or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make&nbsp;check&nbsp;2&gt;&#38;1&nbsp;|&nbsp;tee&nbsp;mout-check</P
>
Finally, after compiling and testing the build, install the software with:
<P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make&nbsp;install&nbsp;2&gt;&#38;1&nbsp;|&nbsp;tee&nbsp;mout-install</P

>Modifying Open Source Software</A
></H4
><P
>When modifying Open Source software it is important to keep cross-platform
portability in mind. The source you modify will in all likelihood be built
on a wide variety of platforms. Your modifications cannot break either the
build or functionality of the software on any other platform. It's also quite
possible that your modifications could be useful to another platform. Thus,
when possible, avoid platform-specific modifications like:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING">
#if defined(_SCO_DS) /* OpenServer */
#define FOOBAR 0
#elif defined(__USLC__) /* UnixWare */
#define FOOBAR 1
#endif /* _SCO_DS __USLC__ */
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
Whenever possible make such a modification based upon defines generated by
the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
> script. For example,
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
> might write out in the 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>config.h</TT
>
file a define of something like HAVE_FOOBAR or NEED_FOOBAR. If so, a more
portable construct for the same modification might look like:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>#if defined(NEED_FOOBAR)
#define FOOBAR 1
#endif /* NEED_FOOBAR */</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
When making platform-specific modifications, the __USLC__ manifest define
can be used for <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>UnixWare</SPAN
> and the _SCO_DS for
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>OpenServer</SPAN
>. If the application has been ported
to Sun Solaris then it is often possible to simply change:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>#if defined(SOLARIS)</PRE
></TD

to
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>#if defined(SOLARIS) || defined(__USLC__) || defined(_SCO_DS)</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>SCO OpenServer and UnixWare 7 are POSIX, XPG4, UNIX 95 and mostly UNIX 98
compliant. Often there are defines for these either in config.h or another
header file. Most applications which comply with one or more of these
standards will simply compile and link. Occasionally trivial modifications
are necessary. For example, the location of the declaration of a function
might reside in different header files and libraries on different systems.
Usually the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>man</TT
> command will indicate the syntax for
inclusion of the declaration and any additional libraries to link against.</P

>The Open Source development model relies upon contributions from vendors,
developers, users and the primary development group. If you have successfully
ported an Open Source project to a new platform or you have made source level
modifications to enhance the software or fixed a bug, you can and should return
your modifications to the project maintainers. In the case of ports and fixes
for SCO platforms you may wish to first submit your modifications to the
Skunkware development team for review and integration with other modifications
to that package. To do so, e-mail your modifications to 
<A
HREF="mailto:skunkware@ronrecord.com"
TARGET="_top"
>skunkware@ronrecord.com</A
>.</P
><P
>Generally, modifications to an Open Source project are returned by e-mailing
a context diff of the relevant changes. That is, if you modified source files
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>foo.c</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>bar.h</TT
> of project fubar 
release 1.0, you would create a context diff of these files:
<P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diff&nbsp;-c&nbsp;foo.c.00&nbsp;foo.c&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;mydiff-fubar-1.0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diff&nbsp;-c&nbsp;bar.h.00&nbsp;bar.h&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;mydiff-fubar-1.0</P
>
This type of file difference is suitable for input to the patch utility.
After creating the patch, test it on a fresh fubar 1.0 source tree.
To return the modification, simply e-mail either the author of the program
or, more commonly, the developer mailing list for the project. For instance:
<P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mail&nbsp;fubar-dev@fubar.org</P
>
These mailing lists are an excellent means of staying abreast of the latest
patches, releases, developer discussions, etc. Usually subscription is open
or the list is archived for perusal by the public. Note that the above example
is illustrative only. To determine the available mailing lists for a project,
visit the project web site.</P
