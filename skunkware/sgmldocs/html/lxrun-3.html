<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="sec-direct"></A> <A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Direct execution of Linux ELF binaries</A>
</H2>

<P>Rather than running Linux binaries with the lxrun front-end, it is possible
to turn lxrun into a program interpreter, ld-linux.so.* - the Linux runtime 
linker. The path of the interpreter is actually embedded in every dynamic 
linked ELF executable - for standard UnixWare / OpenServer ELF it is
/usr/lib/libc.so.1, and for Linux it is /lib/ld-linux.so.1 (or, ld-linux.so.2
for executables linked with GNU libc v2). 
<P>The direct execution of Linux binaries in this manner is in the latest 
development releases of lxrun. At the time of this writing, support for
this model of execution is available on UnixWare platforms only. SCO OpenServer
places some rather strict limitations on what a program interpreter can be.
Overcoming these restrictions is a current development topic.
<P>The following discourse, from Mike Davidson
<A HREF="mailto:md@sco.com">(md@sco.com)</A> the author of lxrun, 
details some of the issues involved in the direct execution model:
<P>"It's actually quite simple to build a version of lxrun which
can be used as the initial program interpreter for Linux binaries.
There are, however, a couple of problems:
<UL>
<LI> runtime linkers are usually ELF shared objects
which don't have a fixed load address, and which have
to do some rather delicate data relocations when they
first start up - I avoided this issue by making the
ld-linux.so.* version of lxrun be an actual ELF executable
(rather than a shared library) bound to a fixed address
which does not conflict with the addresses used by normal
Linux binaries - while this is a bit of a kludge it works
perfectly well</LI>
<LI> the interpreter program loaded by the kernel cannot itself
require an interpreter - what this means is that if the
program interpreter wants to do any dynamic loading of
shared libraries it has to do it for itself - this isn't
too much of a problem on OpenServer since you can just
do a static link of everything that lxrun needs into a
single binary - unfortunately this doesn't work on UnixWare 7
since libsocket is <EM>only</EM> available as a shared library.</LI>
</UL>

I think that there is a way round this, but I haven't had time to
try it out yet. Essentially it looks something like this:
<UL>
<LI>    ld-linux.so.* is created as a dynamic linked shared object
with appropriate dependencies on other shared libraries
(ie at least /usr/lib/libc.so.1 and /usr/lib/libsocket.so.1)</LI>
<LI>    when ld-linux.so.* is loaded by the kernel and gets control,
the <EM>first</EM> thing that it does is to fix up enough of it's
own data relocations in order to be able to run</LI>
<LI>    once that is done, it maps /usr/lib/libc.so.1 (ie the normal
system runtime linker and standard library) into memory,
fakes up a suitable aux vector and invokes the normal
runtime linker, while pretending to be a normal executable
program (this involves a lot of trickery - you have to fake up
an appropriate set of program headers to give to the runtime
linker, you have to fix up entries in .dynamic, .dynsym and
.rel.* to reflect the actual address that ld-linux.so.* is
actually loaded at, and you have to provide a fake entry
point address so that the system runtime linker will give
control back to ld-linux.so.* in the right place ....)</LI>
<LI>    if all of that works, then ld-linux.so.* proceeds as normal,
and now maps in the Linux runtime linker and passes control
to it</LI>
</UL>

I realise that this all sounds hideously complicated, but all of the
alternatives that I can think of are worse in some way.
<P>At first I thought that we could avoid this by just porting a
version of the Linux runtime linker to run native on UNIX, but
this looks like it may be more trouble than it is worth - while
the Linux runtime linker is quite well written it has to deal
with some rather unpleasant limitations in the GNU tools - in
particular it looks as if GNU ld doesn't support the equivalent
of our -Bsymbolic option which makes writing the startup code
for a runtime linker almost impossible (in fact the Linux runtime
linker startup routine is just one massive function that uses
nothing but local variables and which does all of it's system
calls with chunks of inline assembler)."
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 SIGSEGV vs. software interrupt kernel module</A>
</H2>

<P>Consideration was given to implementing a software interrupt kernel module
rather than relying on the "int $0x80" segmentation violation. Rather than
sacrifice the elegance and portability of a "non-kernel" Linux emulation
strategy, Mike Davidson has suggested that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This probably isn't really necessary. Assuming that we are really
only interested in Linux ELF (and <EM>not</EM> Linux a.out) we can use
the dynamic linker to "preload" the Linux runtime compatibility
library in such a way that almost all of the system calls will be
intercepted and handled directly by the compatibility library 
without ever going down to an actual "int $0x80" instruction.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Performance enhancements</A>
</H2>

<P>Thus far, performance has not been an issue as very little negative
impact has been detected.  The main cost of running a Linux application under
lxrun is the overhead of catching the segmentation violation (int $0x80),
fixing up the structures/errors/returns, and mapping the system call.
Since much of what lxrun does is done in the normal course of executing a 
system call natively, the SIGSEGV intercept is the main overhead.
<P>In order to avoid catching SIGSEGV for every system call, current lxrun
development plans on implementing a "pre-load" of the "Linux runtime 
compatibility library" (see the previous subsection). With the direct 
execution of Linux ELF binaries described above, it is possible to pre-load 
this library on startup. That is, the binary has already
been identified as a Linux ELF binary since it is attempting to load
/lib/ld-linux.so.1. This "fake" program interpreter knows it will have to
map system calls so, rather than waiting for the SIGSEGV to trigger the 
mapping, the program interpreter can "pre-map". Thus, system calls made by
the Linux ELF binary under the control of such a program interpreter would
not cause general protection traps. In this scenario, nearly all of the 
performance overhead of running Linux binaries with lxrun is eliminated.
