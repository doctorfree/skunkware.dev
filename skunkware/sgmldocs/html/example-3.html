<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Some examples</A></H2>

<P>Here are examples of things that you'll be using in the source. First,
let's decend into a subsection:
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 This is a subsection</A>
</H2>

<P>As the header says. Note that you need to use the <CODE>p</CODE> command to
start the body of the section, after the <CODE>sect1</CODE> command.
Here's a subsubsection:
<P>
<H3>This is a subsubsection</H3>

<P>Right. 5 levels of sections are available. Use the commands
<CODE>sect</CODE>, <CODE>sect1</CODE>, <CODE>sect2</CODE>, <CODE>sect3</CODE>, and <CODE>sect4</CODE> to get them.
This document uses the <CODE>article</CODE> document style, which is 
appropriate for HOWTOs and other docs; the <CODE>report</CODE> style (which 
includes the <CODE>chapt</CODE> sectioning command) should be used for the LDP docs. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Example text</A>
</H2>

<P>All right, so you're typing along, and you want to show some example code,
or example I/O with a program, whatever. Use the <CODE>code</CODE> or <CODE>verb</CODE>
``environments'' for this, wrapped in a <CODE>tscreen</CODE> environment, as so:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
This is an example verb environment.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

As well as:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
This is an example code environment.
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The <CODE>tscreen</CODE> environment just sets the font to small type and 
indents it nicely. It's not required for using <CODE>verb</CODE> or <CODE>code</CODE>,
but I suggest that you do. 
<P>The <EM>Linuxdoc-SGML User's Guide</EM> explains what special characters you
can and can't use in the <CODE>verb</CODE> and <CODE>code</CODE> environments. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="test-ref"></A> <A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 </A>
Cross references</H2>

<P>What about cross-references? This section has been marked with the
<CODE>label</CODE> command; using <CODE>ref</CODE> will provide a cross reference,
as in ``See Section 
<A HREF="#test-ref">test-ref</A>
'' for more. 
<P>Right now cross-references don't work in the <CODE>groff</CODE> translation for 
plain ASCII.  They do work when generating LaTeX or HTML output.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Using fonts</A>
</H2>

<P>You want fonts, we got fonts. Of course these won't show up in the
plain ASCII text, but they all map into the various output formats:
<B>boldface</B>, <EM>emphasis</EM>, <SF>sans serif</SF>, <I>slanted</I>,
<CODE>typewriter</CODE>, and <I>italics</I>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Lists</A>
</H2>

<P>Lists are easy as well. Just use the <CODE>itemize</CODE> element with the
<CODE>item</CODE> commands, seen here:
<UL>
<LI> This is a list.</LI>
<LI> Nothing exciting about that.
<UL>
<LI> Multiple levels are supported as well.</LI>
<LI> Again, that's no surprise.</LI>
</UL>

<OL>
<LI> Enumerated lists using <CODE>enum</CODE> also work.</LI>
<LI> Description environments using <CODE>descrip</CODE> along
with <CODE>tag</CODE> are also available, as seen here.</LI>
</OL>

<DL>
<DT><B>First item.</B><DD><P>Here's one item.
<DT><B>Second item.</B><DD><P>Here's another.
<DT><B>Third item.</B><DD><P>Can we go for three?
</DL>
</LI>
<LI> A final item to top it all off.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This is just about everything that you need to get started with
writing SGML docs using the <CODE>linuxdoc-sgml</CODE> DTD. Please let me know
if you think something should be changed or added to this document.
