BEFORE PUBLISHING THE ICON LISTS

These icons have been gathered and sorted together in HTML files -

	index.html

	arrows.html
	icons.html
	lines.html
	dingbats.html
	othericons.html

Before serving these files to others, please make sure the URLs in the 
HTML files to refer to your server and the right directory.

ie: change all occurrences 
of   /gifs/
to   /wherever/
using sed for example:

sed 's/\/gifs\//\/wherever\//' < index.html > index.html.new

The convert-url shell-script has been provided for your convenience.
It will convert the "/gifs/ in all the HTML files in this directory to
point to this server instead.  Simply supply the correct hostname for
this server as a parameter.

e.g.:		convert-url  /wherever/


Thank you for your cooperation.

NOTE:
The search program is a Perl script that needs to have
  Local CGI script execution enabled (using .htaccess)
or 
  be placed in the cgi-bin directory and have the link from
  index.html fixed to point to the cgi-bin directory.


BUTTONBARS:
The button bars advice only applies if you are running NCSA HTTPd
and have enabled server side include files (HTTPd 1.3 or later).

If you have not enabled server side includes (eg: for security reasons)
then you might as well remove the reference to buttonbars.html from
the index.html file.



SCRIPTS
=======
convert-url	is a wrapper around sed and a for loop.

make-list	is a simple script to create these lists of icons.
	ls *.gif | make-list > all-icons.html
	This will list all the gif files in the directory and wrap
	them up as inline graphics and place the URLs after each graphic
	so that they can be pasted into documents.

tr		is a simple interface to gif-trans, a program to make
	icons and so on transparent using GIF89 extensions.  Mosaic will
	use this to render inline GIFs correctly (nicely) so that they
	blend into the background, and avoid the white-border effect.
	I got fed up typing all the simpsons parameters.
