<B>Bio</B> compiled by word-guru,
<B>Country Dick Montana</B> (copied by Ken Drew)
<P>
The Beat Farmers are, without question, today's most durable legends of
marginally popular music.
<P>
"Never heard of 'em!", Ya' say? Well, that ain't the Beat Farmers fault,
for in the course of their eleven year existence they have:
<UL>
<LI>Released 6 gem packed albums on Rhino and Curb labels, powered by the
world renowned spottiness of MCA distribution.
<LI>Toured Europe 5 times
<LI>Seen every square inch of the USA and Canada fifteen hundred thousand
times.
<LI>Appeared on "Entertainment Tonight" and made David Letterman an honorary
rodie
<LI>Fathered at least 3 children
<LI>Had tens of dozens of rave reviews heaped upon them, like these:
<UL>
<LI><B>Billboard</B>:<I>"The Beat Farmers may be the best rock-country-blues
band to come down the pike since Credence Clearwater Revival"</I>
<LI><B>Houston Chronicle</B>: <I>"A great show, possibly the hottest flat-out
rock 'n roll I've ever been privileged to witness"</I>
<LI><B>Village Voice</B>: <I>"What elevates the Beat Farmers above the
competition is not only their masterly mix of influences, but the way in
which these sources serve as launching pads for their rocket-blast excursion,
that make you want to dance, cry, and laugh."</I>
<LI><B>Cashbox</B>: <I>"The Beat Farmers are first rate, pure
entertainment."</I>
<LI><B>Vancouver Sun</B>: <I>"Amazing, magical, unbelievable- no
superlative is too great for the wild, wild show the Beat Farmers put on
last night. They twanged, they rocked, they soared, and in the end, they
had a jam packed house screaming for 'more, more, more!"</I>
<LI><B>BAM Magazine</B>: <I>"The Beat Farmers are bizarre, crude, and defy
any rational description, yet above all, they're one hell of a band."</I>
<LI><B>Melody Maker</B>: <I>"The Beat Farmers present a great, sweeping
panorama of styles and accents, riffs and rifts, all welded together with a
unique and considerable force. They can sound like every great band you've
ever loved, but no one has ever sounded like the Beat Farmers. They are a
legend in the making and the making of a legend"</I>

<H2>Beat Farmer Factoids</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The Farmers have led their zealous "secret society" legions in setting
more house bar records than any act in history (most likely- hard to
document this stuff!)
<LI>They've been arrested, burglarized, stiffed, beat-up, shot at, carved-up,
censored, married, divorced, and forced to share dressing rooms with "The
Village People", "Chippendales", "Larry 'Bud' Melman" and that idiot lead
singer for Duran Duran.
<LI>They've sur-thrived four years with no new "product"
<LI>Recorded their long-awaited latest, Viking Lullabys, in Vancouver,
unmolested and free from any industry input what-so-ever.
</UL>

<P><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/skunkware/95/gif/buttons/line.blue.gif" ALT=""><P>

<H2>Viking Lullabys</H2>
Viking Lullabys contains 13 new originals with occasional assistance from
longtime collaborators Mojo Nixon, Paul Kamnaski, and former Farmer Buddy
Blue.
Viking Lullabys is already being hailed as the finest Beat Farmer effort to
date.
<P>
All hail the King of loser-friendly flop-house rock!
<BR>
The popes of stool pigeon bop!
<BR>
Hail those gorgeous tits for tots-
