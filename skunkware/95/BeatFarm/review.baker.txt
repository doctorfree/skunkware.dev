     A column by G. Brown in the Denver Post of Friday, 17 November 1995
     ===================================================================

    I remember going to see the Blasters at the now-defunct Rainbow Music 
Hall in 1985 and being more enamored of the opening act, San Diego's Beat 
Farmers.  They were a stomping bar band with an honest, vigorous sound 
and likable country-rock tunes.
   And when the energy level started flagging, they unleashed thier 
secret weapon--Country Dick Montana.
   Looking like a perverted Wild Bill Hickok, Montana staggered out from 
behind his drum kit to croak such odes as "Happy Boy" and "Big Rock Candy 
Mountain," all the while balancing a cup of beer in his cowboy hat 
before dumping the whole thing over his head and the first few rows.
   He then displayed a talent for terrorizing listeners ("You're scum!") 
while the band provided kazoo/whistling/gargling solos.  For a finale, he 
staggered into the audience for an exhibition of crowd control: "No 
touching my butt!"
   I was impressed.  With the zeal of the newly converted, I met the new 
cult figure following the set.  "It's better in a bar," Montana said.  
"We can play more dirty songs."
   Radio never played the Beat Farmers' records at a national level, and 
that's why last week's news ran as a footnote in the media--Country Dick 
Montana, nee Daniel Monty McClain, collapsed and died on stage in 
Whistler, British Columbia, in front of a sellout crowd.  The cause of 
death was an apparent heart attack.  He was 40.
   The Beat Farmers developed a rabidly loyal following in Colorado, and 
Montana's cheerful vulgarity was a durable legend.  The quartet's 
resident wild man was given to displaying his politically incorrect 
talents during uncensored inebriated interludes.
   He came to life croaking his show-stopping manifestos "King of Sleaze" 
and "I'm Getting Drunk With or Without You."
   At a rowdy appearance at the Hi-Lo in 1986, he showered the front rows 
with Budweiser during his open-beer-bottle-juggling routine and sat in 
the middle of the dance floor to hold a campfire-style singalong.
   At the Boulder Theater a few years later, he proffered the 
middle-finger salute, suppressed an urge to attack a heckler and fell 
off the table he was dancing on, nearly breaking his thick skull.
   If Montana's rambunctious shenanigans were killing his few remaining 
brain cells, the boisterous crowds didn't seem to care.

   When I last interviewed Montana a year ago, the gruff-voiced 
drummer/vocalist was recuperating in a midmorning bubble bath.  It had 
been four years sinced the Beat Farmers' last album--Montana was 
diagnosed with throat cancer, which spread into his lymph nodes and 
thrreatened the loss of his vocal chords.  Doctors had declared him 
cancer-free after three operations.  How had he won the battle?
   "Zen belligerence," he revealed.  "It was mostly maintaining a stage 
of ignorance and not worrying about it too much."
   He showed me his entry in the Beat Farmers Almanac: "Fears death by 
severely hysterical masterbatory convultions (sic) and pre-mature 
aftershock."
   
   Montana was back in top basso profundo form with a trio of hardcore 
drinking songs--a "swillogy," he said, hailing "Baby's Liquored Up," 
"Gettin' Drunk" and "Are You Drinking With Me Jesus?" as "good family 
entertainment."
   "I'm not real good at moderation," he admitted.  "I'm just barreling 
along at my regular pace.  It seems like I have to work a little harder, 
I get fatigued more quickly.  But nobody's mentioned that I seem any 
different, unless they're raggin' on me.  It's like telling me not to hit 
the drums so hard--I can't help it!"

   The Beat Farmers were on tour in support of their latest release 
"Manifold," with Montana leading his multitudes in setting house bar 
records.  His new song was "Beer Ain't Drinkin," co-written with Mojo Nixon:

       "Don't eat the cans kids.  Whew-wee!  I can drunk 
        you all outta the table...You were never my 
        friends...I'm blurring at you not wid you!...What's 
        all this wet gunk I'm sittin' in...Let's go to 
        what's her name's house...I'll drive--where's my pants?"

   He had recently completed a solo album called "The Devil Lied to Me," 
which should be released next year.
   To paraphrase his adaptation of Kenny Rogers' "Lucille": You picked a 
real bitchin' time to leave us, Country Dick.
