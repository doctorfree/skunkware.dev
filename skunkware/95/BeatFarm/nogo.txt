From the news article I just sent out to the BFer list:

Raney, Harris, Rolle Dexter Love and Buddy Blue gathered against a chain
link fence behind Winston's about midway through the evening for a photo
op.  Raney quipped later that they were all of the "former Beat Farmers."

The Beat Farmers will not continue without McLain, Raney said.

It comes as no surprise to all of us that the BFers are no longer.
Without Country  Dick Montana it could never be the same.

All I hope is that Jerry and Joey countinue to play together
somehow. They are both truly gifted song-writers and 2/3's
of a fine musical team. It is their music that got me into the
BFers and hopefully we will all still here "Riverside", "Hollywood
Hills", "Bigger Stones", "Make It Last", etc.

Here's hoping it WILL last.......
