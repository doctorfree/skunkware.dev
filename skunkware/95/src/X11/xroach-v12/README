This patch to xroach adds two new options and support for virtual root
window managers, such as tvtwm.  It also fixes a couple of potential 
memory faults.

The new options are -squish to enable squishing roaches with the mouse
and -rgc to set the color of the roach guts that splash out.  Yellowgreen
is recommended.

To apply the patches, unpack this file in your xroach directory using sh
then incant:

    patch -p0 <xroach.patch1
