     <STRONG>NAME</STRONG>
          <STRONG>xv</STRONG> - interactive image display for the X Window System

     <STRONG>SYNTAX</STRONG>
          <STRONG>xv</STRONG> [<EM>options</EM>] [<EM>filename</EM>[<EM>filename</EM>...]]

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          The <EM>xv</EM> program displays images in the GIF, JPEG, TIFF, PBM,
          PGM, PPM, X11 bitmap, Utah Raster Toolkit RLE, PDS/VICAR,
          Sun Rasterfile, BMP, PCX, IRIS RGB, XPM, Targa, XWD,
          possibly PostScript, and PM formats on workstations and
          terminals running the X Window System, Version 11.

          The documentation for XV is now distributed <EM>only</EM> as a
          PostScript file, as it has gotten enormous, and is no longer
          very well suited to the 'man' page format.  Print a copy of
          the (100-ish page) manual found in <EM>docs</EM>/<EM>xvdocs.ps</EM>.  If you
          are unable to get the manual to print on your printer, you
          may purchase a printed copy of the XV manual.  Click on
          'About XV' in the program to get further information.

          If you don't <EM>have</EM> the PostScript file, it is part of the
          standard XV distribution, the latest version of which can be
          obtained via anonymous ftp from <EM>ftp.cis</EM>.<EM>upenn.edu</EM> in the
          directory pub/xv
