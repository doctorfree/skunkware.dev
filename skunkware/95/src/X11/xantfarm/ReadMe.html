     <STRONG>NAME</STRONG>
          xantfarm - displays a simulated ant hill in the root window

     <STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>
          <STRONG>xantfarm</STRONG> [<STRONG>-n</STRONG> <EM>num</EM>] [<STRONG>-c</STRONG> <EM>cycles</EM>] [<STRONG>-i</STRONG>] [<STRONG>-display</STRONG> <EM>name</EM>]

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          <EM>Xantfarm</EM> simulates an ant hill and displays it in the root
          window.

          There are three <STRONG>Elements</STRONG> in the ant world: <STRONG>Air</STRONG>, <STRONG>Dirt</STRONG>, and
          <STRONG>Sand</STRONG>.  Ants move through <STRONG>Air</STRONG>, dig up <STRONG>Dirt</STRONG>, and drop it as
          <STRONG>Sand</STRONG>.  Ants have three <STRONG>Behaviors</STRONG>: <STRONG>Wandering</STRONG>, <STRONG>Carrying</STRONG>, and
          <STRONG>Panic</STRONG>.  There are a few simple probabilities built in to the
          program that control the transitions between <STRONG>Wandering</STRONG> and
          <STRONG>Carrying</STRONG>.  To see them <STRONG>Panic</STRONG>, try poking the ants with the
          cursor.

     <STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
          <STRONG>-n</STRONG>   Specifies how many ants to simulate.  The default is
               10.

          <STRONG>-c</STRONG>   Specifies how often the simulation runs, in cycles per
               second.  The default is 15.  If you specify 0, it runs
               continuously.

          <STRONG>-i</STRONG>   Forks a background process and prints the process-id to
               stdout.  Useful if you want to make a menu command to
               kill <EM>xantfarm</EM>.

     <STRONG>BUGS</STRONG> <STRONG>/</STRONG> <STRONG>DEFICIENCIES</STRONG>
          It really needs a control panel to adjust probabilities
          without having to recompile and restart.
