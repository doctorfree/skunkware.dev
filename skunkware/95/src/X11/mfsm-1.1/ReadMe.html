<H2>Description</H2>

       Mfsm  is a X-Windows Motif utility that monitors freespace
       and user quotas of filesystems.  The  program  displays  a
       drive  icon,  a usage bar chart, and an alert bell toggle.
       The drive icon displays the type of filesystem being moni-
       tored  (e.g. floppy, disk, cdrom, user account). The usage
       bar gives a display of the percentage use of the  filesys-
       tem   and  displays  the  amount  of  space  remaining  in
       megabytes. If the file system is a user account with  quo-
       tas  enabled,  then  the  usage bar will display remaining
       quota space available. A "(Q)" will be displayed if quotas
       are being used. The usage bar changes colour depending the
       amount of file system use. The alert bell toggle  is  used
       to disable the alert bell that sounds when the file system
       is full.
