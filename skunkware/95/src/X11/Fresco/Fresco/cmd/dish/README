Dish (Dynamic Invocation SHell) is a Tcl application that allows
invocation of Fresco objects through a scripting interface.  Users can
bind Fresco objects to Tcl variables and commands and directly invoke
operations that are supported by these objects.  Sample scripts are in
the '../../examples/dish' directory.
