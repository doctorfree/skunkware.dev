Dialog Issues:
--------------

- Follow memory management conventions (return refed objects).

- Is there a licensing problem with using the motif bitmap files?

- Need to position the dialog.  Maybe position the default button
under the cursor as closely as possible without moving part of the
window off screen.  Need Display::pointer_location(Coord& x, Coord& y)
For now we center the dialog in the show_for window, and don't check
to see if this causes part of our window to be out of view.

- Deal with virtual window managers.  Dialog windows should not appear
partially off screen.  The typical way to enforce this is to look at the
screen size and place the dialog window so that it will be fully on screen.
Virtual window managers must be taken into account when figuring out the
screen size.

- It would be nice to read the flavor and choice glyphs from a file
which the user specifies using a style parameter.  Right now he must
give the name of a bitmap file for a flavor and a string for a choice.

Menu Issues:
------------
 
- Accelerators must have their keysyms inserted in the following order:
  XK_Control_L, XK_Shift_L, XK_Caps_Lock, XK_Meta_L, XK_Alt_L, KeySym

- The current update strategy is pretty harsh:
  1) When you change the enabled state of a leaf item you get a single item
     redraw.  This is what you want.
  2) If you change any other state you must remove the item, change it,
     then insert it back.  This is not what you want.
  3) There is no protocol to efficiently make a set of changes.
  4) If the menu system is active when an update happens it is closed.
     We could be more friendly and just try to reselect the old path
     as much as is possible.

- How do I do a caseless comparison on CharCode?  KeySym?

- How can I append and do other common operations on CharStrings?
 
- Need "TransientWindow::transient_for(in Window w)".
 
Menu Bugs:
----------

- MainViewer::need_resize doesn't update window manager size information
- Window::title doesn't seem to do anything
- style bug, doesn't get *grab:true from xrdb
 
Menu ToDo:
----------
 
- check performance and memory use

- ensure that popup menus are totally visible on the screen
- handle menus that are too large to fit on the screen

- option menus
- popup menus
 
- tear-off button and stay-up menus
- 2-d menus
 
- make it so that menubar glyph can be in multiple paths in the glyph dag

- resolve problems with using pointer comparisons

Viewport & Browser:

These are still under development so they aren't included in the build yet.
