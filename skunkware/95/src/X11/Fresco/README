Fresco is an object-oriented application programming interface (API)
for development of window-based applications.  It draws many ideas
from the InterViews toolkit that was developed at Stanford University
in the late '80s and early '90s, but provides a single, simple object
model that allows composition of both graphical objects (circle,
polygon, etc.) and application objects (word processor, spreadsheet,
etc.).  Fresco allows these application objects to be transparently
distributed by using OMG CORBA to specify their interfaces, which is
especially useful for application embedding.  Additionally, the Fresco
API is screen resolution-independent, meaning objects can appear the
same on different kinds of displays or when printed.

Fresco Mar94 is included in the X11R6 distribution available from the
X Consortium. This version includes rudimentary structured graphics
and the ability to use Fresco objects in an Xt/Motif widget. Fresco
Nov94 and updated snapshots are available to the public via anonymous
ftp from file://ftp.faslab.com/pub/Fresco. This version uses dynamic
loading to access the various kits (widgets, figures, layout) and
includes code to use native Win32 calls instead of Xlib on NT. For
