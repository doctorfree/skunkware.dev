The SCO Skunkware 5.0 team is proud to be able to deliver Fresco, a
graphical C++ programming environment. In order to immediately begin
using Fresco, you need only set your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH as follows :
<PRE>
csh users :

      % setenv PATH $PATH:/usr/skunk/bin
      % setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/skunk/lib

sh and ksh users :

      $ PATH=$PATH:/usr/skunk/bin
      $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/skunk/lib
	  $ export PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</PRE>
That is, add /usr/skunk/bin to your PATH and /usr/skunk/lib to your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
<P>
You are then ready to try out the examples.
<PRE>
Try out fdraw :

      $ fdraw

Try hello :

      $ cd /skunkware/src/X11/Fresco/build/Unix/examples
      $ ./hello

and

      $ ./figgy

Fresco is an object-oriented application programming interface (API)
for development of window-based applications.  It draws many ideas
from the InterViews toolkit that was developed at Stanford University
in the late '80s and early '90s, but provides a single, simple object
model that allows composition of both graphical objects (circle,
polygon, etc.) and application objects (word processor, spreadsheet,
etc.).  Fresco allows these application objects to be transparently
distributed by using OMG CORBA to specify their interfaces, which is
especially useful for application embedding.  Additionally, the Fresco
API is screen resolution-independent, meaning objects can appear the
same on different kinds of displays or when printed.

Fresco Mar94 is included in the X11R6 distribution available from the
X Consortium. This version includes rudimentary structured graphics
and the ability to use Fresco objects in an Xt/Motif widget. Fresco
Nov94 and updated snapshots are available to the public via anonymous
ftp from //ftp.faslab.com/pub/Fresco. This version uses dynamic
loading to access the various kits (widgets, figures, layout) and
includes code to use native Win32 calls instead of Xlib on NT. For
further information about Fresco including updated build instructions,
please check the World Wide Web home page at http://www.faslab.com.

To build Fresco for a given platform, see the README for your platform
under the Fresco "build" directory.

For more information...

Read the Fresco World Wide Web home page,

    http://www.faslab.com/

check the Fresco USENET newsgroup (actually it was for discussion
of InterViews, but it's being used for discussion of Fresco as
well),

   news:comp.windows.interviews

and consider joining the Fresco mailing list, which the X
Consortium has opened to the public.  This is the place for all
questions, bug reports, flames, etc.  To join, send a message to
requests@x.org containing the text:

   subscribe fresco ADDRESS  

where ADDRESS is optional and specifies the address you would like
added to the mailing list.  ADDRESS defaults to your From:
address.  Then send your posts to fresco@x.org.  Please do NOT
use this address for administrative requests like subscribing and
unsubscribing from the list, asking for help on how to use the
list, etc.  Use requests@x.org instead.
