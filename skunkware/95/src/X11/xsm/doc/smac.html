<A NAME="langcons">
<H1>Language Constructs</H1>
<H2>Data Types</H1>
The macro language provides a set of basic types that you may use in
your programs:
<PRE>
int	An integer capable of storing signed whole numbers 
real	A real value
string	A sequence of ascii characters 
char	An ascii character
</PRE>
A variable can be declared using these types through a simple declaration
either at the start of your program (visible to the entire program) or
at the start of a function (only visible to that function). A typical 
declaration is of the form:
<PRE>
int sharenumber;
</PRE>
You can build on these basic types in two ways, arrays allow you
to design storage areas that contain a sequence of data values of
a particular type and structures allow you to combine multiple
types within a larger container.
<P>
An array is declared through the use of the <CODE>typedef</CODE> statement.
If you are used to the C language then, you should be aware that you must
use <CODE>typedef</CODE> to produce arrays.
<PRE>
typedef real pricetype[100] 
pricetype prices;
</PRE>
In the example above a new type called <CODE>pricetype</CODE> is 
created.  This new
type consists of 100 reals. The program then defines the variable
<CODE>prices</CODE> to be of the <CODE>pricetype</CODE> type. When you
define an array in this manner, you can index each element within the
array using <CODE>[x]</CODE>, where x is the member of interest. All 
references start at 0.
<P>
A structure is produced with the <CODE>struct</CODE> statement.  This
allows any number of data types to be grouped together.
<PRE>
struct group {
	string securityname;
	real price;
};
</PRE>
This defines a structure named <CODE>group</CODE> that has fields called 
<CODE>securityname</CODE> (a string) and <CODE>price</CODE> (a 
real).  Having defined a structure you may declare a variable <CODE>
newvar</CODE> that is of this type with:
<PRE>
struct group newvar;
</PRE>
You can can also combine the definition of the structure with the
declaration of the variable:
<PRE>
struct group {
        string securityname;
        real price;
} newvar;
</PRE>
It is also possible to use typedef with structures, for example
to create a new type <CODE>groupt</CODE> that is an alias 
for the <CODE>group</CODE> structure you would use: 
<PRE>
typedef struct group groupt
</PRE>
<P>
To reference fields within a structure simply use the <CODE>.</CODE>
operator:
<PRE>
	newvar.securityname="security name not set";
	newvar.price=0.0;
</PRE>
<P> 
You may store a date using the <CODE>DATE</CODE> type.  The date type
is set to a specific date with
<A HREF="#dialogdaterange">dialogdaterange</A> and 
<A HREF="#getdate">getdate</A> commands. Most operators are defined
on the date type and you can add a whole number of days to a date
by simply adding an integer (the number of days) to the date in question.
<P>
Securities are stored using the <CODE>SECURITY</CODE> type. Typically
this is set by calling the
<A HREF="#dialogsecurity">dialogsecurity</A> function that prompts the
user for a valid security name.  Few operators are valid on the
<CODE>SECURITY</CODE> type.
<P>
<H2>Statements</H2>
A statement in the macro language is the basic building block. A statement
can consist of:
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="#ifthen">if expression statement</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#ifthen">if expression statement else statement</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#while">while (expression) statement</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#while">do statement while (expression)</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#for">for (expression;expression;expression) statement</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#expressions">expression</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#functions">return (expression)</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#functions">return</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#while">continue</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#while">break</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#functions">function calls</A>
</UL>
All statements should be terminated with a semicolon.
When multiple statements are combined a compound statement is produced. The
macro language uses braces to specify a compound statement:
<PRE>
	{
	statement1;
	statement2;
	}
</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="expressions">
<H2>Expressions</H2>
<P>
An expression in the macro language can include an assignment. For example
the expression:
<PRE>
	b=(a=10)+1
</PRE>
Will assign a to 10, b to 11 and has a value of 11.
<P>
A complete set of operators, with full precedence, is supported. The
normal mathematical operations are available using the conventional
symbols:
<PRE>
*	Multiplication
/	Division
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
</PRE>
<P>
For comparisons the operators are:
<PRE>
!=	Not equal
=	Equal
<	Less than
>	Greater than
<=	Less than or equal to
>=	Greater than or equal to
</PRE>
<P>
Other operators are:
<PRE>
^	Exclusive or
&	bitwise and
|	bitwise or
&&	logical and
||	logical or
(expr)	Parenthesis
<P>
You should note that not all types will support all operators.
<P>
Constants can be included within expressions.  The available constants
include integers, real numbers and strings enclosed within quotes.
</PRE>
<A NAME="functions">
<H2>Functions</H2>
<P>
A function allows you to group a number of statements together so
that you may reuse the same code in multiple ways.  A function is
declared using the syntax:
<PRE>
typename function_name(arguments)
{
	variable_declarations

	statements
}
</PRE>
The <CODE>typename</CODE> declaration specifies the type that will
be returned by the function and can be omitted if the function
returns no values. 
<P>
In the simplest form, the arguments used by a function are declared
in the same way as normal variables but using a comma to delimit
each argument. For example, if a function requires two arguments, the
first being an integer and the second a string the declaration would
be:
<PRE>
function_name(int num,string text)
{
	......
	......
}
</PRE>
This creates two variables for use by the function.  The first 
<CODE>num</CODE> is
the integer and the second, <CODE>text</CODE>, is the
string.  So if the function
was called with:
<PRE>
function_name(10,"hello");
</PRE>
Then <CODE>num</CODE> would be 10 and 
<CODE>text</CODE> would be "hello". Note with this syntax
the variables are strictly local so you CANNOT assign new values to them
and have the caller see those new values.  The assignment will only
apply while the program is executing within the context of the function.
Frequently you may wish to return multiple values from the function and
therefore need to assign values that can be seen outside of the scope
of the function. This can be achieved with the <CODE>byref</CODE>
qualifier.
<PRE>
function_name(byref int num,byref string text)
{
	num=100;
}
</PRE>
When arguments are declared in this manner, the function is able
to modify the actual values passed by the caller:
<PRE>
a=200;
function_name(a,"hello");
print(a);
</PRE>
In this instance the value that will be displayed will be 100 and
NOT 200.  If the <CODE>byref</CODE> keyword had not been included,
the value 200 would have been shown.
<P>
When you wish to pass structures to a function, either by value or
by reference, you will need to declare the argument that is a structure
using a real type and not with the struct keyword.  For example:
<PRE>
struct simplestruct {
	.....
	};

typedef simplestruct structtype;

function(byref structtype arg)
{
	....	
	.....
}
</PRE>
This same method should also be employed when you wish to pass arrays
to functions. 
<P>
Functions can return values using the <CODE>return</CODE> command.  
The type that
is to be returned should be specified in front of the function name. For
example if the macro has a function called <CODE>createname</CODE> that
returns a string the function would be written:
<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
string createname()
{
	....
	....
}
</CODE>
</PRE>
At any point within the function, a call can be made to <CODE>return</CODE>
command passing a value that evaluates to a string.  If you need to be
able to return, prior to the last statement in a function, from a function
that has no return value then you can simply use <CODE>return</CODE>
without an argument.
<A NAME="ifthen">
<H2>Conditional Expressions</H2>
<P>
The macro language provides a complete if..then..else construct:
<PRE>
	if (expression)
		statement
	else
		statement
</PRE>
The else part of the construct is entirely optional and can be omitted
when not necessary. At execution time, the expression within the if
statement is evaluated.  When it is non-zero (TRUE), the first statement
will be executed. If it is zero and an else clause is specified, the
second statement following the else will be executed. Although the
expression in the if statement is treated as having boolean properties,
it can be of any integer type.
<P>
<A NAME="while">
<H2>The while and do..while Constructs</H2>
<P>
The while construct provides the basic building block for iteration
within macros. The while construct allows a statement (including
a compound statement) to be continually executed:
<PRE>
while (condition) {
	.....
	code
	.....
	.....
}
</PRE>
The statements within the braces will be executed until the boolean
expression given by condition becomes FALSE. With most macros it
is usually that the code that is executed within the loop will
eventually result in the condition becoming FALSE. If the condition
is FALSE before the loop starts then the loop will not be executed.
If the loop should always be executed at least once, then the do..while
construct should be used:
<PRE>
do {
	.....
	code
	.....
	.....
} while (condition);
</PRE>
The loop is executed once and the condition is evaluated. If it is FALSE
the loop will be executed from the top, otherwise the statement following
the while() command will be executed. 
<P>
Within a while (or do...while) loop, the <CODE>continue</CODE> and
<CODE>break</CODE> commands may be used. The <CODE>continue</CODE>
statement takes the point of execution back to the top of the loop.
The <CODE>break</CODE>
command will change the point of execution to the first statement
that follows the loop.
<A NAME="for">
<H2>The for construct</H2>
<P>
The for construct is based upon the while construct. The statement
<PRE>
for( i=0; i<100; i=i+1)
	print(i,"\n");
</PRE>
Is equivalent to the statement:
<PRE>
i=0; 
while (i<100) {
	print(i,"\n");
	i=i+1;
}
</PRE>
Unlike C or C++ you must specify all three expressions within the for
statement.

         w+   truncate or create for update

         a+   open (append) or create for update
</PRE>
<P>
The returned value from fileopen is of type FILE and should be assigned
to a variable of FILE type.  The file can be read or
written as appropriate.  However before the file is accessed it is 
recommended you use eof() to determine that the file is correctly open.
A typical code fragment for reading from a file would be:
<PRE>
<CODE>
	FILE file;
	string input;

	....
	....
	
        file=fileopen("pricedump","r");

</UL>
<PRE>
<HR>filewrite(file,arg1,...,argn)
FILE file;

<PRE>
<HR>fileread(file,arg1,..,argn)
FILE file;
(any) argi;
</PRE>
Reads the arguments arg1 to argn from the file.  The arguments can be of
any type.  Typically to read ascii files you will need to use the
filereadline() command that is able to interpret files on a line by
line basis.
<P>
<PRE>
<HR>filereadline(file,arg1,..,argn)
FILE file;
