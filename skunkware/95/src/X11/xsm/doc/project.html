<A NAME="projectmain">
<H1>The Project Menu</H1>
<P>
The project menu provides an assorted set of functions that help you
configure and tailor the way in which XSM works:
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="#preferences">Preferences</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#macrofiles">Macro Files</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#defaultcolours">Default Colours</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#selectportfolio">Select Portfolio</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#findknownsecurities">Find Known Securities</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#quit">Quit</A>
</UL>
The project menu is just one set of menu options on the
entire XSM menu bar. The <A HREF="overview.html#overview">overview</A>
provides a complete top level list of all menus.

<H1>Preferences</H1>

<P>
The preferences dialog allows you to specify which fonts will be used
for the three major uses.  The main text font, is used for most dialogs
but is not used when large amounts of text need to be displayed within
a window, for example when a dividend summary is shown.  For large amounts
of text, the text font is used.  This can be any font, fixed or proportional.
Those displays that need a fixed font, will use the specified fixed font.
Typically this is confined to the price display/edit dialog, where it
is easier on the eye if all numbers line up.  It is recommended that a
fairly small font is used for this purpose.  
<P>
The selection for the update method needs to be made
on the basis of your available
input choices.  If you are reading information from a teletext 
device, then selecting Teletext will allow XSM to decode the display
format used by teletext.  The ascii format allows the price loader
to simply present lines of security names with their prices.  If you don't
have an automated mechanism for price retrieval, then you should not
specify any security as having an automatic update.  In such cases,
the teletext/ascii selection is not applicable and can be safely 
ignored.
<P>
The prices path specifies where all the price files can be located. 
Normally this is set in <CODE>/etc/default/xsm</CODE> but can be
overridden by the path specified in the user's preferences or via
the <CODE>xsmprices</CODE> environment variable.  If you previously 
defined a path
but wish to revert to the &quot default &quot price files, then simply
delete the information given so that the field is blank.

<A NAME="macrofiles">
<H1>Macro Files</H1>
<P>
Macro files are the mechanism that you can use to extend and enhance
the functionality of the XSM application.  This menu option will allow
you to add or remove macro files from the list that is loaded when
XSM first starts.
<P>
<IMG SRC="projectmacro.gif">
<P>
If you remove a macro file with the 'REMOVE' button, then if it has
already been loaded it will remain in memory but the next time XSM is 
started, the file will NOT be loaded.  If you add new macro files to
the load list, then those will be loaded if you select 'OK'.  Whenever
you select 'CANCEL' any files you have added to the list will be
ignored, but those that you may have removed with the 'REMOVE' button
will remain marked as removed.  If you wish to add them back to the
list then you will need to explicitly do so. 
<P>

<A NAME="defaultcolours">
<H1>Default Colours</H1>
<P>
XSM uses an inheritance approach to colours.  This means you can tailor
the colours used by all the major display windows both independently and
as a class.  When a window has no explicit colours assigned to be used
by it, then the default colours are selected.  This dialog controls the
settings of those default colours.
<P>
<IMG SRC="projectcolour.gif">
<P>
To change the colour for a particular purpose, first select the
appropriate function, for example, the 'Background' button. Then
used the list of colours to select a new colour.  You may repeat
this for each of the "purposes" shown.  If you are selecting
colours for a specific display window, then there may be many
different purposes to chose from. You should note that the foreground
and background colours will be used by XSM when displaying text
summaries (i.e. dividend or transaction information) but not for 
rendering features such as menu bars, sliders, etc.  These remain
under the control of the standard Motif/Display manager colour selections. 
<P>
If you press 'STORE SELECTION' then the XSM database will be updated,
so that future invocations of XSM will use the colours that you have
just defined.  If you don't press this button, then the colours as they
are defined will apply only to the current invocation.  If you wish
to remove the previously stored colour definitions from the XSM 
database simply press 'CLEAR SELECTION'.

<H1>Find Known Securities</H1>
<P>
<STRONG>
THIS COMMAND IS ONLY SUITABLE FOR TELETEXT BASED SYSTEMS.
</STRONG>
<P>
This issues a request to a binary that must be called 'nameldr' and is
on the current working path.  The binary must prepare teletext based
pages, that contain all the security names currently known to the
system.  XSM will take this list, sort it, remove noise and duplicates,
and then display those securities which are not already in use
by the system.
<P>
Multiple securities may be selected from this list and created in
bulk.

<A NAME="quit">
<H1>Quit</H1>
<P>
This will close the XSM session.  All windows opened by XSM will be closed,
and any settings that have not been explicitly saved to the disk will be
lost.
