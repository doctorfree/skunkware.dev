<H1>Obtaining Hardcopy</H1>
<P>
Most windows that display output from XSM allow you to obtain hardcopy.
You should look for the 'Print' option that appears on most 'Project'
menus.

<H1>Selecting your printer</H1>
<P>
XSM supports postscript and PCL based output.  If your printer
is unable to understand neither of these two popular printer languages
then you will need to write a printer driver for XSM.  Whenever you ask
for hardcopy, the printer dialog illustrated below will be displayed.
You should ensure that the paper size (shown in the units specified
by the current preferences) is correctly set and that margins are
appropriate.  You may choose a printer from any of those displayed in
the list with the selected printer being displayed below the list.
<P>
Output can be directed to one of three output devices.  The 'To lpt:'
option will ensure the output is sent directly to the printer. 'To File' 
allows you to write the output to a file, for printing at a later date.
To set the name of the file, you will need to click on 'PRINTER SETUP'.
The 'Preview' option gives an impression, on the display, of how the
output will appear when it is printed.
<P>
When you select 'OK' the hardcopy will be made (or preview displayed)
as well as the current printer settings being stored ready for next 
time you wish to print something.  If you need to return to the standard
output settings, simple click on 'SET DEFAULTS'.

<P>
Because printer devices vary, each output driver also has a 'private'
setup dialog.  This is displayed when you click on 'PRINTER SETUP". A
typical dialog is shown below.  Use this dialog to set the options
that your printer spooler requires and the name of the output file, 
when you ask for output to be directed to a file.
