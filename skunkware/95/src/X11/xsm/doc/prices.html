<H1>The Prices Menu</H1>

The prices menu provides many different functions related to 
the prices of securities:
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="#display">Display - Displaying prices</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#edit">Edit - Editing prices</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#autoupdate">Auto update prices - Automatic price updating</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#fullupdate">Full update prices - Complete price updating</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#validate">Validate - Price validation</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#avalidate">Auto validate- Automatic price validation</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#updatestatus">Update status - Status of price updates</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#changeprice">Change in prices - Changes in price from last update</A>
</UL>
The prices menu is just one set of menu options on the
entire XSM menu bar. The <A HREF="overview.html#overview">overview</A>
provides a complete top level list of all menus.
<HR>
<A NAME="display">
<H1>Displaying Current Prices</H1>
<P>
The price display option allows you to look at the prices for each
day in their numeric form. Using the left hand side of the dialog,
simply select the month and the security of interest. The prices
will be shown on the right hand side.

<A NAME="edit">
<P>
<H1>Editing Current Prices</H1>
<P>
The price edit menu option is based on the price display option, but
allows you to edit any of the displayed prices simply by clicking on the
price in question.  The display will then show a smaller dialog where
you are able to enter a new price.  If you wish to remove a price for
a given date, then click on it as usual, but when you enter a new
price simply type 'no price' in the dialog.

<A NAME="autoupdate">
<H1>Automatic price updates</H1>
<P>
When you have a large number of securities, automatic price updating 
allows you to update all their prices without needing any user 
interaction.  Whether you will be able to use automatic price updating
will depend on whether your system is installed with any hardware that
allow prices to be extracted from external sources (e.g. teletext
adapters).  Assuming you have the necessary hardware and drivers,
you can use this option to bring the price database up to date. Only
securities that have been marked as 'Automatic Update' will be 
affected by this operation.
<P>
While the update is taking place, no other activity will be possible
and a busy dialog will indicate how far the update has progressed.
<HR>
<A NAME="fullupdate">
<H1>Full Price Updates</H1>
<P>
A full price update builds on the automatic price update to update
the prices of all securities.  The first stage of a full update is
for the system to perform an automatic update.  Once complete, the
XSM determines the securities that have still not had their prices
updated and (provided the securities are marked as having 'Manual
Updates') displays a dialog for each security to obtain the current
price from the user.
<P>
<STRONG>When price information is being shared between many users,
one user performing a price update can affect all other users. It is
strongly recommended that in these cases, the system administrator
makes price files read only for the user community and takes the
responsibility of ensuring they are updated.</STRONG>
<HR>
<A NAME="validate">
<H1>Price validation</H1>
<P>
After a system crash, or other serious failure, there is a possibility
that one or more price files are inconsistent. This option will scan
all the files and report problems.  When a problem is reported,  the user
is given the choice of letting the system attempt a repair. You should
be aware that data can be lost in this process, if the system is unable
to make the price file(s) consistent without removing some price
information.
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="avalidate">
<H1>Automatic price validation</H1>
<P>
This is the same as the standard validation, described above, but
attempts repairs without asking the user.  If there are many failures,
this option should be considered as it removes the need for any user
interaction during what can be a very lengthy process.
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="updatestatus">
<H1>Update status</H1>
<P>
When using price input sources, such as teletext it is possible that the
abbreviations used for the different securities will change over time.
Detecting these changes can be difficult, unless you monitor which 
securities are not being updated when you perform an automatic price
update.  This option will display a dialog, that summarizes how many
securities have (and have not) been updated with the latest prices and
names those that were not updated.  It should only be used after
a price update. 
<P> 
<IMG SRC="pricesummary.gif">
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="changeprice">
<H1>Change in prices</H1>
<P>
The change in price window gives complete information on how prices
changed after a price update.  For each security it shows the new
price, the previous price, the change and the % change.
<P>
The 'Options' menu allows you to chose whether only those securities
that are in the current portfolio will be displayed or whether all
known securities will be shown.  You should be aware, that if you 
ask for all securities and you have defined many (>2000) then
noticeable time will be taken when the window is updating the display.
<P>
The 'Order' menu gives three orderings for the display.  The securities
can be shown in:
<UL>
<LI> Alphabetical order
<LI> Losers (those whose price fell) first
<LI> Leaders (those whose price rose) first
</UL>
<P>
You can also select which types of change to look at with the 'Selection'
menu. By default the window will only show those securities whose
prices changed.
