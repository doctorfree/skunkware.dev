This section provides an overview of the XSM.  If you are not familiar
with XSM, or this is the first time, you have used it, you are recommended
to refer to the <A HREF="startout.html#beforeyoustart">Before You Start</A>
description.
<P>
The main window with
XSM, as illustrated, consists of many menus and two key work areas.  The
top most work area, shows information that applies to the current
status of the system, for example, the name of the working portfolio.
The botton area, provides a general output area, that can be used
by both the builtin XSM functions and user written macros.
