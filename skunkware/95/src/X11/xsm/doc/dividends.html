the current portfolio and add new dividend payments to that portfolio:

<H1>Displaying Current Dividends</H1>
<P>
The dividends display shows the dividends that have been received
for the securities in the current portfolio. By default, this will
show the dividends regardless of the date they were received, but
a particular date range can be specified by the 'Dates' option on
the 'Project' menu.
<P>
You may chose which types of dividend will be shown (default is
all) by using the 'Dividend Type' menu. The 'Security Type'
menu specifies the type of the security that will be considered for
display.
