<H1>Creating An Initial Portfolio</H1>

<P>
A portfolio brings together all the information relating to the
stocks you own.  A portfolio consists of:
<UL>
<LI> A sequence of transactions on a set of securities. For example
purchases and sells.
<LI> The dividends that have been received on the securities that
have been purchased.
</UL>
</P>
The first time you start XSM, there will be no portfolio information
so XSM will automatically ask you if you wish to create a portfolio:
</P>
<IMG SRC="startout_noport.gif">
<P>
Although XSM can operate without a portfolio, this is unlikely to
be useful and it will result in files being written in your current
working directory. Therefore you should always create a portfolio. This
is achieved by entering the name of the portfolio in the 'Select A Portfolio'
dialog that will automatically appear. The name is entered in the text
entry box indicated in the below figure. Once
entered the name of the portfolio
will appear in the 'Available portfolios' box and 'OK' can
be selected.  The portfolio will be automatically set as the default
portfolio.  Additional portfolios may be created at this time, by entering
their names.  If you wish to change the current portfolio chose 'SELECT'
after selecting the chosen portfolio and to set it as the default
portfolio chose 'SET AS DEFAULT'. Portfolios may be removed with the 'REMOVE'
button.  You may create or delete portfolios at any time, so you need not
worry about creating all your portfolios at this point in time.

If you wish to learn more about managing your portfolios, you may 
wish to refer to the section
<A HREF="project.html#selectportfolio">selecting a portfolio</A>.
Once you have created your portfolio, XSM will continue initializing
and present you with a dialog to make it clear there is no warranty
with this program:

<A NAME="building">
<H1>Building A Portfolio</H1>
</A>
Once XSM has started, the first step in building up your portfolio
is to define the securities that you wish to use within XSM. You may
define any number of securities and those that you define may be used
by any portfolio or no portfolio.
<P> 
If you have other users on the system then they may already have
a set of securities defined that you wish to also use.  If this 
is the case, you should copy their securities definition file:
<P>
<KBD>
cp <VAR>current_user</VAR>/.xsm/securities ~/.xsm
</KBD>
<P>
The securities definition file is always called 'securities' and
held within the .xsm directory that exists in the user's home directory.
Even if you do not wish to use all the securities defined by another
user, you may find it more convenient to copy their definitions and
then modify or delete those that are not appropriate.
<P>
If you need to create your security definitions from scratch, you
should select 'Create Security' on the 'Securities' menu. This 
will provide you with a 
<A HREF="securities.html#create">dialog to create a security</A>.
Simply repeatedly use this menu option to define all your 
securities.  If you are using a teletext based system, you
may be able to use the 'Find known securities' option on the 'Project'
menu.  This will download all the security names that can be found on
the teletext pages and allow you to create them in bulk using a single
security definition as a template for them all.  Whether this ability
exists will depend on the interface to the teletext information
that is provided by your hardware.
<P>
With your securities defined, you can start to really build your
portfolio.  Generally you will will need to bring the system
up to date with all your previous transactions.  This is achieved
with the 
<A HREF="transactions.html#transactionsmain">'Transactions' menu</A>.
Dividends can be entered with the 
<A HREF="dividends.html#dividendsmain">'Dividends' menu</A>.
<P>
Before entering either dividend or transaction information always
check that the current portfolio is the one to which the operation
applies. The name of the current portfolio is permanently displayed
in the main window.
<P>
Once you have brought your portfolio up to date, you may wish to ensure
the prices being used by the system are also up to date. Price information
is held in a special directory hierarchy that can either be system wide
or private to a user.  Your system administrator will be able to 
tell you if there is system wide price information and if this is the 
case there is nothing else for you to do as XSM will automatically
use this information provided the system administrator has set the path
in <CODE>/etc/default/xsm</CODE>.  For example, to set the path to
<VAR>/usr/lib/xsm/ prices</VAR>, the file <CODE>/etc/default/xsm</CODE> would
contain an entry of the form:
<P>
<CODE>xsmprices=</CODE><VAR>/usr/lib/xsm/ prices</VAR> 
<P>
If there is no system wide information, or you wish to use your own
private price data, you will need to define the environment
variable <CODE>xsmprices</CODE> prior to running the program or
set it using the 'Preferences' option on the 'Project' menu. 
<P>
Once the system has been brought up to date you are ready to explore
all the 
<A HREF="overview.html#overview">other features</A> provided
by XSM.
