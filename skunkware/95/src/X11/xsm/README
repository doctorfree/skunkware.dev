Running
=======

Please refer to the html based documentation.

Building
========

Before you can build XSM on an SCO platform you will need a skunkware
cd or access to:

	- gcc
	- g++
	- flex
	- bison
	- cproto

Use the Imakefile to produce the Makefile.  If you have not modified
the standard sco.cf file (see /usr/lib/X11/config/sco.cf) to include
in PATH the directory with the above utilities, you should edit the
line in the makefile:

PATH = /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:....

To:

PATH = /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:....:/usr/skunk/bin

(If you are not using the skunkware cd, insert the location of the
required tools in place of "/usr/skunk/bin"). 

Ensure that /usr/bin appears in $PATH before any other directory
that may contain alternative make utilities.  XSM will not currently
build with the GNU make.

Use make to build XSM.  Thats it!!

To install it, use make do_install.


TO DO
=====

- Improved support for printer fonts.
- Better color dialog.
- Use of templates rather than casts for some of the basic classes.
- Some of the classes are not examples of good C++ and would be
  better if re-written.
- Some of the basic classes could be further optimized.
- Build full scrolled text windows from the macro language
- Lots more features for the macro language.
