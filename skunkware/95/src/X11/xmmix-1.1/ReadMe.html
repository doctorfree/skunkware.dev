          xmmix - Audio mixer utility for X11/Motif


     <STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>
          <STRONG>xmmix</STRONG> [<EM>toolkitoption</EM> ...] [-<EM>dev</EM> <EM>device</EM>] [-<EM>autoload</EM> <EM>path</EM>] [-
          <EM>exitreset</EM>] [-<EM>debug</EM>] [-<EM>demo</EM>]


     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          <EM>Xmmix</EM> is a program that allows the use of the mixer section
          of the sound card hardware supported by the VoxWare driver.
          See the README file in the <EM>xmmix</EM> distribution for further
          information about VoxWare.

          There are up to ten input level sliders (Synth, PCM, Alt
          PCM, Line, Line-1, Line-2, Line-3, Mic, CD) and up to four
          output level sliders (Rec Mon, Rec Out, Speaker and Master).
          The Input Gain control, Output Gain control, Bass and Treble
          tone control sliders are also available.  Each of the level
          sliders include a "lock" toggle button which allows the
          settings of the two stereo channels to be changed
          simultaneously or independently.  The input controls also
          include a "rec" button (where applicable), which allows the
          input sources to be selected for recording.  The tone
          control sliders have a "Flat" button which causes these
          controls to revert to the center setting.  In addition,
          these controls are available: a "Mute" button to silence the
          audio, a "Loudness" button to engage frequency response
          compensation, and an "Stereo Enhance" button to set the
          stereo separation enhancement.

          <EM>Xmmix</EM> queries the capabilities of the sound board during
          start-up, and will only display controls corresponding to
          features that are actually implemented in the hardware.

          The various controls in the <EM>xmmix</EM> main window are meant to
          be self explanatory.  Additional features include the
          ability to save mixer settings in a file and load it at a
          later time.  A "Reset" feature resets all controls to their
          start-up settings.

          While the use of a mouse is natural with <EM>xmmix</EM>, all
          functionality can also be operated via the keyboard.  This
          is in conformance to the guidelines published in the
          <EM>OSF</EM>/<EM>Motif</EM> <EM>Style</EM> <EM>Guide</EM> from the Open Software Foundation.


     <STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
          All standard <EM>Xt</EM> <EM>Intrinsics</EM> toolkit options are supported.
          In addition, <EM>xmmix</EM> supports the following options:

          -<EM>dev</EM> <EM>device</EM>
               Specifies the path name to the raw mixer device.  If
               this option is not used, the default device used is
               /<EM>dev</EM>/<EM>mixer</EM>.

          -<EM>autoload</EM> <EM>path</EM>
               Specifies the path name to a mixer settings file that
               is automatically loaded when xmmix starts.  This forces
               all control settings to those specified in the file.
               If this option is not used, then the control settings
               will be queried from the mixer hardware itself.  This
               option overrides the <EM>XMmix</EM>*<EM>autoLoadOnStartUp</EM> X
               resource.

          -<EM>exitreset</EM>
               Causes all mixer controls to reset to their start-up
               state when xmmix is exiting.  This option overrides the
               <EM>XMmix</EM>*<EM>resetOnExit</EM> X resource.

          -<EM>debug</EM>
               Causes verbose debugging diagnostics to be printed on
               <EM>stderr</EM>.

          -<EM>demo</EM>
               Invokes <EM>xmmix</EM> in "demo" mode.  This causes <EM>xmmix</EM> to
               display all controls as if they are functional, but
               does not actually operate the sound hardware.


     <STRONG>X</STRONG> <STRONG>RESOURCES</STRONG>
          <EM>Xmmix</EM> has many adjustable X resources to customize its look
          and feel, as well as its behavior.  Notably, the colors of
          virtually every feature on <EM>xmmix</EM>'s windows can be changed,
          as well as the text fonts.

          The resource names and their defaults can be found in the
          <STRONG>LIBDIR</STRONG>/<EM>app</EM>-<EM>defaults</EM>/<EM>XMmix</EM> file (where LIBDIR is typically
          /<EM>usr</EM>/<EM>lib</EM>/<EM>X11)</EM>.  It is not recommended that you change values
          in the <STRONG>LIBDIR</STRONG>/<EM>app</EM>-<EM>defaults</EM>/<EM>XMmix</EM> file, unless you want the
          changes to be forced upon all users of <EM>xmmix</EM> on the system.
          Instead, make a copy of this file, change the copy as you
          see fit, then place it in your home directory.  Your custom
          resource settings will then override the defaults when <EM>xmmix</EM>
          is subsequently started.  Alternatively, you may also place
          specific resources you wish to override in the .<EM>Xdefaults</EM>
          file in your home directory.
