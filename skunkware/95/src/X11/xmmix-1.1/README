INTRODUCTION
------------

Xmmix is a sound mixer utility for the X Window System using the
OSF/Motif interface.  It requires the "VoxWare" sound driver by
Hannu Savolainen (hannu@voxware.pp.fi), also known as the Linux
sound driver.  See notes below about how to get VoxWare.

This version of xmmix has been tested by the author with VoxWare
version 2.4, 2.5, 2.90 and 3.0.  It is expected to work with earlier
and future versions.

The OS platforms supported by xmmix is the same as those supported
by VoxWare, which includes several UNIX variants for the Intel x86
PC:
	Linux
	FreeBSD
	NetBSD
	SCO UNIX and Open Desktop
	UNIX SVR4.2 (Novell UnixWare and others)

It should be fairly easy to port VoxWare to other PC UNIX
platforms.

Likewise, the sound cards supported by xmmix are those that
VoxWare supports.  Currently, this includes:

	Adlib
	Creative Labs Sound Blaster series
	Media Vision Pro Audio Spectrum 16
	Media Vision Jazz16 based soundcards (ProSonic, 3D etc.)
	Gravis UltraSound
	Gravis UltraSound MAX
	Gravis UltraSound with 16 bit sampling daughter card
	Roland MPU-401
	Microsoft Windows Sound System
	COVOX SoundMaster II
	ECHO-PSS (cards based on the PSS architecture by Analog Devices.
	          Including Orchid SW32, Cardinal DSP16 among others).
	MediaTriX AudioTriX Pro
	Ensoniq SoundScape
	SoundMan Wave
	and others

Not all versions of VoxWare supports all of these cards.
Please refer to the VoxWare documentation for further details.
Comments and questions about the VoxWare driver and utilities
should be directed to "hannu@voxware.pp.fi".

This distribution now comes with several 32x32 pixmap files
suitable for use as an xmmix desktop icon:

	xmmix.icon - for Novell UnixWare
	xmmix_a.px - for SCO Open Desktop (XPM2 format)
	xmmix_b.px - for SCO Open Desktop (XPM2 C format)
	xmmix.xpm  - for other systems that use XPM format

You can use the appropriate icon setup utilities under each of
these environments to create an xmmix icon (with which you can use to
launch xmmix).

Comments, suggestions, and bug reports about xmmix are very welcome!
Write to "ti@amb.org".

If you have a CD-ROM drive, you are invited to try a full-featured
X11/Motif CD Audio Player utility that I wrote.  It's called "xmcd"
and supports many UNIX OS platforms and CD-ROM drives.  Xmmix and
xmcd makes an ideal pair in your multimedia system.  A non-X
command line CD player "cda" is also included in the xmcd package.
See notes below about the anonymous FTP location.


WHERE TO GET XMMIX
------------------
The source code release of xmmix v1.1 is available via
Internet anonymous FTP.  Location:

	(Instructions)
	ftp.x.org:/contrib/applications/xmmix/xmmix-1.1.README
	(gzip'd tar archive)
	ftp.x.org:/contrib/applications/xmmix/xmmix-1.1.tar.gz

The package require the "gunzip" (GNU unzip) utility to uncompress.
The source code to gzip/gunzip can be found on various FTP sites
(such as prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu).


WHERE TO GET VOXWARE
--------------------

VoxWare files can be obtained via anonymous FTP from the following
directory:

	sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/kernel/sound


WHERE TO GET XMCD
-----------------

Xmcd files can be obtained via anonymous FTP from the following
directory:

	ftp.x.org:/contrib/applications/xmcd


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

You must have X11R4/Motif 1.1 or later to build xmmix.  Xmmix has
been successfully built under X11R4 with Motif 1.1, and X11R5 or
X11R6 with Motif 1.2 or Motif 2.0.

If you are running Motif 1.1, I recommend version 1.1.4 or later.
Also, you must have an ANSI C compatible compilation environment.

Xmmix can be built using the native X libraries that are supplied with
your OS release.  If you have XFree86 installed, you can also build
xmmix using the libraries from the XFree86 distribution.  Make sure
you use the right set of X include files to match!  Motif is not a
part of the XFree86 package, so you will need to get it separately.
Motif is available from various third party vendors for those OS
platforms that do not come standard with the libraries and headers.
If you cannot find a commercial Motif product for your platform
you can also build the Motif library from the OSF sources (if you
have the source license).

If your system has imake (most supported systems do), use these
steps to build xmmix:

    1. Take a look at the Imakefile, read the comments, and make
       changes as appropriate.  Pay special attention to the
       comments pertaining to the LOCAL_LIBRARIES=XmClientLibs
       line.  You may need to change it in order to successfully
       compile xmmix.
    2. Type "xmkmf" (or "imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/lib/X11/config")
    3. Type "make depend" (this step is required only if you intend
       to modify the source code or header files).
    4. Type "make"
    5. Type "make install" to install the binary and app-defaults file.
    6. Type "make install.man" to install the man page.

If your system does not have imake, use these steps to build xmmix:

    1. Type "cp Makefile.std Makefile"
    2. Edit Makefile.  You will most certainly need to make some
       changes in this file to make things compile on your OS
       platform.
    3. Type "make"
    4. Type "make install" to install the binary and app-defaults file.
    5. Type "make install.man" to install the man page.


NOTES
-----

On some systems, there appears to be a problem with the vendor
shell widget class in the shared Motif library.  The symptom is
the following message printed on stderr:

    Error: attempt to add non-widget child "dsm" to parent
    "xmmix" which supports only widgets

Rearranging the order of the Motif and X libraries linked may
alleviate this problem, and re-linking with the static Motif
library instead of the shared version usually solves this problem.

If you get messages similar to these when you start xmmix:

    Warning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfActivate
    Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfActivate: BulletinBoardReturn()'
    Warning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfCancel
    Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfCancel: BulletinBoardCancel()'
    etc...

These messages are displayed when the LIBDIR/XKeysymDB file is not
installed on your system (where LIBDIR is typically /usr/lib/X11).
A XKeysymDB file is supplied with the xmmix release.  When the
XKeysymDB is installed in the proper location this problem should
go away.
