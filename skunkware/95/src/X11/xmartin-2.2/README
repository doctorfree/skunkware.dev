Xmartin is an X11 root window decorator based on the Barry Martin hopalong
algorithm (see A. K. Dewdney's column in the 9/86 Scientific American.)
See the HISTORY file for changes since xmartin 2.1.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
The materials include both an Imakefile and a simple makefile (xmartin.mk).
Review the one you intend to use and make any changes needed for your 
environment. 

Xmartin is very floating-point intensive. Be sure to include in CFLAGS
any options to improve floating-point performance (eg: -f68881 on Sun 3's.)

If your system does not have perl(1) installed, you may want to comment out
the lines having to do with "xmartin+". If you have perl but it is not in 
/usr/bin/perl, modify the first line of xmartin+.pl. 

If you find it necessary to modify the source code to get xmartin to compile 
or execute correctly, I'd appreciate hearing about the problem and what you 
did to get around it. I'd also appreciate hearing about success on platforms
other than those below.

Xmartin has been built & tested on the following client platforms:

    o IBM RS/6000 540 AIX 3.1.6 - (X11R4) Perl 4.010
    o Convex 240 9.0 OS (X11R4) Perl 4.010
    o Sequent Symmetry S81 Dynix 3.0.17.7 (X11R4) Perl 4.010
    o Sun 3/50 SunOS 3.5 (X11R4)
    o Sun 3/60 SunOS 4.1 (X11R4)
    o VaxServer 3500 BSD 4.3/Reno gcc (X11R4) Perl 3.37
    o Apollo 425t DomainOS 10.3.4 unoptimized cc (X11R3) 
    o VaxServer 3500 Ultrix-32 V3.0(Rev 64) (X11R4) Perl 3.15
    o Cray 2 Unicos scc (X11R3)

And with the following servers:

    o NCD 19 monochrome - X11R3
    o Sun 3/50 monochrome - X11R4
    o Sun 3/60 color - X11R4
    o Visual Turbo X-19 grayscale - X11R4
    o IBM RS/6000 320 color - X11R3
    o IBM Xstation 120 grayscale - X11R3
    o IBM Xstation 120 color - X11R3


Using xmartin
-------------
After installation, the unadorned command 'xmartin' should set your root 
window to one of the roughly 1e64 basic hopalong patterns. Review the man 
page for options you may want to try. 'xmartin help' or 'xmartin+ help' 
yield a concise synopsis of options.

On clients without strong floating point performance, try '-tile' which
reduces calculation time by a factor of 2 to 64, and produces some pleasing
effects as well.

Using xmartin+
--------------
On systems with perl, several additional features are available with the
xmartin+ front end to xmartin. Executing xmartin+ will create a ~/.xmartin+ 
file with entries you can modify to tailor the random probabilities and
parameter ranges hardwired into xmartin. The file has comments describing
its format and several sets of xmartin parameters you can request by name by

	      xmartin+ -n name

'xmartin+ -q' lists the names available. 'xmartin+ -demo' will invoke xmartin
once for each name.  (If you don't have perl, you can peek at these parameter
sets in the xmartin+.pl source.) I'd appreciate hearing about any interesting
parameter sets you discover.

xmartin+ also has options to save an interesting pattern in ~/.xmartin+ and to
generate patterns repeatedly.

About perl: perl is a language devised by Larry Wall with most of the features
of new awk, sed, tr, shell scripts, and C -- sort of one-stop shopping for 
things you don't want to do in C. It has it's own newsgroup (comp.lang.perl)
and O&A Nutshell book: Programming Perl (info: 1-800-338-6887.) The source 
is freely available (jpl-devvax.jpl.nasa.gov in pub/perl.4.0/kits@0). It 
builds easily on most un*x platforms and can usually be coaxed on the others.

Quotes

       Clearly these curious configurations show us that the rules 
       responsible for the construction of elaborate living tissue 
       structures could be absurdly simple.
