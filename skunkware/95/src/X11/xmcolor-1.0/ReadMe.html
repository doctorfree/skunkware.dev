Xmcolor is a color mixer utility for the X Window System using the
OSF/Motif interface.  It is useful when setting up the color
resources of various X applications, where you can browse the
color database of pre-defined color names, or mix a custom color
using the red, green and blue sliders.  The desired color name
is shown and can be cut-and-paste'ed into an editor.
<P>
This utility is not architecture or OS platform dependent, and
should be portable to any UNIX-compatible system supporting
OSF Motif and the X window system.
<P>
Comments, suggestions, and bug reports about xmcolor are very welcome!

The colour names in rgb.txt don't always mean alot, and it is
normally very hard to get the exact colour you want for an app.
This utility makes it easy.
