# xmcolor - Motif(tm) Color Mixer
#
# by Ti Kan

INTRODUCTION
------------

Xmcolor is a color mixer utility for the X Window System using the
OSF/Motif interface.  It is useful when setting up the color
resources of various X applications, where you can browse the
color database of pre-defined color names, or mix a custom color
using the red, green and blue sliders.  The desired color name
is shown and can be cut-and-paste'ed into an editor.

This utility is not architecture or OS platform dependent, and
should be portable to any UNIX-compatible system supporting
OSF Motif and the X window system.

Comments, suggestions, and bug reports about xmcolor are very welcome!

WHERE TO GET XMMIX
------------------
The source code release of xmcolor v1.0 is available via
Internet anonymous FTP.  Location:

	(Instructions)
	ftp.x.org:/contrib/applications/xmcolor/xmcolor-1.0.README
	(gzip'd tar archive)
	ftp.x.org:/contrib/applications/xmcolor/xmcolor-1.0.tar.gz

The package require the "gunzip" (GNU unzip) utility to uncompress.
The source code to gzip/gunzip can be found on various FTP sites
(such as prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu).


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

You must have X11R4/Motif 1.1 or later to build xmcolor.  Xmcolor
has been successfully built under X11R4 with Motif 1.1, and X11R5 or
X11R6 with Motif 1.2.

If you are running Motif 1.1, I recommend version 1.1.4 or later.
Also, you must have an ANSI C compatible compilation environment.

Xmcolor can be built using the native X libraries that are supplied
with your OS release.  If you have XFree86 installed, you can also build
xmcolor using the libraries from the XFree86 distribution.  Make sure
you use the right set of X include files to match!  Motif is not a
part of the XFree86 package, so you will need to get it separately.
Motif is available from various third party vendors for those OS
platforms that do not come standard with the libraries and headers.
If you cannot find a commercial Motif product for your platform
you can also build the Motif library from the OSF sources (if you
have the source license).

If your system has imake (most supported systems do), use these
steps to build xmcolor:

    1. Take a look at the Imakefile, read the comments, and make
       changes as appropriate.  Pay special attention to the
       comments pertaining to the LOCAL_LIBRARIES=XmClientLibs
       line.  You may need to change it in order to successfully
       compile xmcolor.
    2. Type "xmkmf" (or "imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/lib/X11/config")
    3. Type "make depend" (this step is required only if you intend
       to modify the source code or header files).
    4. Type "make"
    5. Type "make install" to install the binary and app-defaults file.
    6. Type "make install.man" to install the man page.

If your system does not have imake, use these steps to build xmcolor:

    1. Type "cp Makefile.std Makefile"
    2. Edit Makefile.  You will most certainly need to make some
       changes in this file to make things compile on your OS
       platform.
    3. Type "make"
    4. Type "make install" to install the binary and app-defaults file.
    5. Type "make install.man" to install the man page.


NOTES
-----

On some systems, there appears to be a problem with the vendor
shell widget class in the shared Motif library.  The symptom is
the following message printed on stderr:

    Error: attempt to add non-widget child "dsm" to parent
    "xmcolor" which supports only widgets

Rearranging the order of the Motif and X libraries linked may
alleviate this problem, and re-linking with the static Motif
library instead of the shared version usually solves this problem.
