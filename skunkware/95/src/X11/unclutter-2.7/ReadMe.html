<H2>Description</H2>

       unclutter removes the cursor image from the screen so that
       it does not obstruct the area you are looking at after  it
       has  not  moved  for a given time.  It does not do this if
       the cursor is in the root window or a button is down.   It
       tries  to  ignore jitter (small movements due to noise) if
       you have a mouse that twitches.



<DL>
  <DT><STRONG>Productivity</STRONG>
  <DD> Useful for being able to see things when the cursor is obscuring them.
    Especially useful with lots of windows and  Focus-follows-Pointer
    focus Model.
    

  <DT><STRONG>Safety</STRONG>
  <DD>Examined code + use it all day every day ( buried in my 
	session startup)
