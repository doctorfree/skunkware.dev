<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
The XPM library provides routines for manipulating X pixmaps.  It
is used by variety of net software for X.
The include file is in /usr/skunk/include/X11/xpm.h.
Although I would prefer to have it .../include/xpm/xpm.h, many applications
assume it is in X11.
The library is in /usr/skunk/lib/libXpm.a, so you can access it
via -L/usr/skunk/lib -lXpm
<DT><B>Productivity</B>
<DD>You need it to build various programs


<DT><B>Safety</B>
<DD>Examined code, been using it.

<DT><B>Work Planned</B>
<DD>None.  But I have modified it so that it can produce XPM files
that are (as far as I know) displayable by the desktop in ODT 3.0.
This is controlled by a configuration define when you build the library.
It would be possible to make this a runtime switch with relatively
little trouble.
If built on ODT 3.0, this is enabled.  If built on other platforms,
this is disabled.

<DT><B>Documentation</B>
<DD>The doc directory contains a postscript file.  I've
never read it, since I just use this library for building
existing applications.
There is no man page.

<DT><B>Verification</B>
<DD>There is an example program that uses it in the sxpm
subdirectory.  Compile it and try it.

<DT><B>Configuration</B>
<DD>
Configuration is done through config.imake, then xmkmf, then
make Makefiles.
