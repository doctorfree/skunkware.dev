WHY XASCII?

    I wrote this one because I got fed up with having to look up the ascii
man page every time I wanted a charater value.  It`s a neat little handy
reference to have on your desktop.  A couple of instructors here have even
taken to using it in their labs.

busy until then.


BUGS

    None that I know of.

An OLIT Version?

	If anyone is interested in seeing an OLIT 2.5 version of XAscii, send
me email.  If enough people are interested, I'll take a day off and 
crank one out.
