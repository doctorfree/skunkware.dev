<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
This program displays an arbitrary prompt in a X dialogue
box in the centre of your screen.  You can type into it
without having to move your mouse into the new window.
The text you input, is then returned on stdout.

This is useful for menus displayed by your window manager.
If you need an argument for the program you want to launch,
you cat get it by using xprompt in backquotes in place of
the arguments.

The X resources in a file called "res" in the source
directory will make the dialogue box look nice on an NCD.
