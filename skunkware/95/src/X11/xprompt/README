  xprompt 2.0

   Copyright (C) 1990 Michael Murphy and Robert Forsman

  This is the new and improved xprompt.  Actually, we ditched the
original xprompt code and wrote this from scratch.  You may want to
call this xprompt2 if you are truly fond of the original.

  xprompt is often used in ``s from windowmanager menus.  We use it to
send shells to machines that aren't on our menus, and to enable novice
users to send zephyrgrams easily.
  some examples:
"F6" = : root : !"xterm -geom 40x20 -e zwrite `xprompt -rlen 20 -p User` & "
"L10" = c|m : root : !"xrshell `xprompt -rlen 20 -p Machine`&"

  xprompt's arguments normally consist of several "-p promptstring".
Each -p can be accompanied by a "-r defaultreply".  -grab and -nograb
control whether xprompt grabs the keyboard.  The other options are
better documented in the manual page.

  When given multiple "-p"s the xprompt displays all prompts at once
(with any default replies for each) and the user can use <Return>, ^M,
^N, and <Tab> to advance to the next field.  <Return> and ^M will exit
xprompt if they are typed in the last field.  ^N and <Tab> will wrap
to the top if typed in the last field.  ^P and <Shift><Tab> will move
to the previous field, wrapping to the bottom if typed in the first
field.  ^C will exit the application without any output.

  When the user types <Return> in the last field, xprompt will print
the field values in order, one to a line, on stdout.

  I recommend using a large font for xprompt.  I use
xprompt*font:   *new century schoolbook*-r-*--20*
  in my .Xres.  You will also have to add
xprompt.replyLength: 20
  to prevent the xprompt from stretching off the screen.  You can
always override it with command line args anyway.
