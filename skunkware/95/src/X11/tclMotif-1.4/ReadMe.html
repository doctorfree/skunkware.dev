<H2>Description</H2>
       This  is  a  binding of the Tcl language to the Motif widgets.  
       Tcl is an interpreted language originally  intended
       for  use  as a command language for other applications. It
       has been used for that, but has also become  useful  as  a
       language in its own right.
<P>
       The standard set of widgets in the  X  world  is  now  the
       Motif  set.  This  forms a large set of widgets, and these
       have been through a large amount of development  over  the
       last  five  years. Use of this set is sometimes a requirement 
        by busineses, and other widget sets try to conform to
       them in appearance and behaviour.
<P>
       This system allows the programmer to use the Motif widgets
       instead  of  the  Tk  widgets  from  Tcl  programs.   This
       increases programmer choices, and allows comparison of the
       features of both Tcl and the Tk/Motif style of widget programming.   
        The  binding  gives the full set of Motif widgets, 
        accessible through the simple interpreted  Tcl  language.
