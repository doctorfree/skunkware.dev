<H2>Description</H2>

    This program  displays a window containing a message  from  the
       command  line,  a file, or standard input. If the message
       text doesn't fit entirely within the  window  scroll  bars
       appear,  as  necessary,  along the left side and below the
       message, to allow the user to browse  through  it.   Along
       the  lower edge of the message is a row of buttons; click-
       ing the left mouse button on any  of  these  buttons  will
       cause  xmessage  to  exit.   Which  button  was pressed is
       returned in the exit status and,  optionally,  by  writing
       the label of the button to standard output.
 <P>
       Xmessage  is  typically  used  by shell scripts to display
       information to the user or to  ask  the  user  to  make  a
       choice.
