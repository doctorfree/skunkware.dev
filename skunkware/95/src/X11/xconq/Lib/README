This is the library directory for XCONQ.  It includes all support files
for day-to-day usage.  It also includes some incomplete and/or marginal
files that are not really suitable for regular use, as well as some test
maps useful only for debugging.

The file "mapfiles" contains the names and descriptions of "official"
mapfiles; those well enough tested to be released on gullible gamesters.

"xconq.news" is the news file (surprise).

Mapfile naming follows some general rules (which are enforced by some
command line options, see the man page):

*.map files are terrain data or terrain + units at detail level 1.

*.per files are period descriptions alone.

*.scn files are scenarios.

*.b files are bitmaps.

*.onx files are X10 fonts.

*.bdf and *.snf files are ASCII and compiled X11 fonts, respectively.
