     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          <EM>Xneko</EM> displays a window in which a cat chases your "mouse"
          cursor.  Try moving the mouse inside and outside the <EM>xneko</EM>
          window, leaving it stationary, moving it slowly and quickly,
          etc., and watch the cat respond.

          All options except the last five above behave in the
          standard manner for X applications (see <STRONG>X</STRONG>(1)).  The <STRONG>-front</STRONG>
          option allows the cat to run in front of all the windows on
          the desktop.  The <STRONG>-back</STRONG> option allows the cat to run in back
          of the windows, on the desktop itself.  The <STRONG>-speed</STRONG> option
          controls the speed of the cat (the default is 16).  The <STRONG>-</STRONG>
          <STRONG>time</STRONG> option controls the interval (in milliseconds) between
          updates of the <EM>xneko</EM> window (the default is 500).  The <STRONG>-help</STRONG>
          option provides a usage message and exits.

          The program was originally written by a Japanese author as a
          Macintosh desktop accessory (The word "neko" means "cat" in
          Japanese).
