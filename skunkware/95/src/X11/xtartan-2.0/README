This is version 2.0 of Xtartan, a program to draw Scottish tartans.

Version 2 allows you to specify tartan information using X resources
(rather than having to compile them in as in the previous version),
so you can quite easily add your own definitions if you wish (see the
man page for details on how to do this.)  However, you probably will not
need to do this unless you are creating a new tartan, since Xtartan now
comes with the definitions for over 240 tartans included.

If you have another tartan that is not in this list that you would like
me to add, or if you have a variation or think that one of these tartans
is wrong, you must send me the thread count and the source of your
information.  Please tell me about the copyright on that source as well.

Xtartan requires its resource file to run.  If you have trouble getting it
to use the file directly, you can try "xrdb -merge XTartan.ad" before
running xtartan.
