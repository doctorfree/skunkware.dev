    **************************  ABOUT LLNL XFTP  *************************
    **********************************************************************

    LLNL XFTP is a graphical user interface to FTP (File Transfer Protocol).
    LLNL XFTP does not execute the ftp program; instead, it directly com-
    municates with remote FTP servers.  LLNL XFTP is an X client and is
    based on OSF/Motif.  LLNL XFTP enables users to transfer files and
    perform various directory manipulation commands, both remotely and
    locally.  Two especially notable features are the ability to (1) perform
    "third-party" file transfers, and (2) transfer or delete entire directory
    substructures.

    LLNL XFTP was written by Neale Smith of the Lawrence Livermore National
    Laboratory, which is operated by the University of California.

    **********************************************************************

    LLNL XFTP has been successfully built on the following platforms
    (and a bunch of others):

          Intel 486           BSD/386                     1.2.2
          i486                System V R4.0.3             1.2
          i386                SVR4                        1.2.1
          ?                   SCO Open Desktop 3.0        1.2.1

    Perform the following steps to build LLNL XFTP:

    1. Enter the "sources" directory and type "xmkmf" to create "Makefile"
       from "Imakefile".  If you are unable to get this to work, use the
       backup makefile, "Makefile.alt", by uncommenting (and possibly
       editing) the section which seems most promising for your platform.

    2. Type "make" to build the executable "xftp".

    3. Type "make install" to install the executable and the application
       defaults file (the color version of the app defaults file is used).

    4. Type "make install.man" to install the man page.

    IMPORTANT: Bugs in versions of Motif earlier than 1.1.4 can cause
               LLNL XFTP to  work incorrectly.


    **********************************************************************
    ********************  Application Defaults File  *********************
    **********************************************************************

    It is usually not necessary to use an application defaults file with
    LLNL XFTP (since LLNL XFTP contains built-in fallback values).  You may
    wish to use an application defaults file with LLNL XFTP if you want to
    customize certain widget attributes such as fonts or colors.  Sophis-
    ticated X users can make use of the widget hierarchy that is documented
    in LLNL XFTP's man pages to fine tune LLNL XFTP's appearance.

    If your X display supports color, use "XFtp.color" as LLNL XFTP's
    application defaults file.  (A symbol link to XFtp.color, "XFtp.ad",
    is in the "sources" subdirectory.)

    If your X display does not support color, use "XFtp.mono" as LLNL XFTP's
    application defaults file.

    Change the name of "XFtp.color" or "XFtp.mono" to "XFtp" and make sure
    that XFtp is in the search path of one of the X application defaults
    file environment variables (e.g., XAPPLRESDIR, XFILESEARCHPATH, or
    XUSERFILESEARCHPATH).  Consult the usual X documentation on how to
    set and use these environment variables.

    NOTE: LLNL XFTP 2.0 is not compatible with the version 1.0 app defaults
          file.  A good way to tell whether an old XFtp is being picked up
          is that the view button on the main window will be labeled
          "viewButton" instead of "View".


    **********************************************************************
    ***************************  Limitations  ****************************
    **********************************************************************
    
    Here are some things to watch out for:

      (1) LLNL XFTP might not work with some old X servers.  For example,
          some older OpenWindows servers might dump core.  MacX fans should
          use nothing older than version 1.1.7b.

      (2) Old, buggy versions of Motif can cause weirdness.

      (3) LLNL XFTP might not work correctly with some non-Unix FTP servers
          (If you can give us temporary access to such a server, we might
          be able to fix the problem.)

      (4) Out-of-spec FTP servers can cause untold grief.  (Most Unix-based
          servers work correctly.)

      (5) Third-party file transfers will not work unless at least one of
          the remote FTP servers supports the PASV (passive) command.
