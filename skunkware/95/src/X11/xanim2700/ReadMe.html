               <STRONG>+</STRONG>  JFIF images. NOTE: use XV for single images. This is
                  more for animation of a sequence of JPEG images.
               <STRONG>+</STRONG>  MPEG animations. Currently only Type I Frames are
                  displayed. Type B and Type P frames are currently
                  ignored, but will be added in future revs.
               <STRONG>+</STRONG>  WAV audio files may have their sound added to any
                  animation type that doesn't already have audio, by
                  specifying the .wav file after the animation file on
                  the command line. Currently only the PCM audio codec
                  is supported.
               <STRONG>+</STRONG>  any combination of the above on the same command
                  line.

          <EM>XAnim</EM> also provides various options that allow the user to
          alter colormaps, playback speeds, looping modes and can
          provide on-the-fly scaling of animations with the mouse.

     <STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
          A + will generally turn an option on and a - will turn an
          option off.  This can be reversed at compile time. (see
          <EM>xanim_config</EM>.<STRONG>h</STRONG>).

          In each SubMenu, the options can be run together with no
          intervening spaces. In the list of SubMenu options presented
          below, the first letter given is the letter that specifies
          the SubMenu and should NOT be repeated if several SubMenu
          options are to be run together.

          For example, "+Cn +Cs10 +CF4" can also be written as
          "+Cns10F4" or "+CF4s10n".

          A + or a - within a SubMenu will be an exit from that
          submenu.  Options will affect all animations following the
          invocation of that option. Some options may be changed in
          between animations without affecting previous animations.

          In the following sections, an <EM>num</EM> represents an integer
          number and an <EM>fnum</EM> represents a floating point number. If a
          floating point number is of an integer amount, the . need
          not be specified. There should be no spaces between the
          option and the numbers.

          <EM>aopts</EM> SubMenu for Audio Options

               <STRONG>+AD</STRONG><EM>dev</EM>  AIX Only. Specify audio device. Default is
                       /dev/paud0/1 . Another common audio device is
                       /dev/acpa0/1 . For example: "+AD/dev/acpa0/1".

               <STRONG>+Ae</STRONG>     Audio Enable. XAnim will ignore audio data if
                       this option is not used.

               <STRONG>+Ak</STRONG>     This option allows XAnim to skip video frames
                       in order to help keep video in sync with audio.
                       default is on.

               <STRONG>+As</STRONG><EM>fnum</EM> Scale Audio playback speed by "fnum". Only the
                       range 0.125 to 8.00 is allowed.

               <STRONG>+Ap</STRONG><EM>num</EM>  This turns a hardware specific Audio port on or
                       off. The default port is selectable in
                       xanim_config.h. It's shipped with internal
                       speaker as default.

                        0 - internal speaker

                        1 - headphones or external speaker

                        2 - line out

               <STRONG>+Av</STRONG><EM>num</EM>  Sets the inital Audio Volume(0-255) with 0 the
                       lowest. default is 100.

          <EM>copts</EM> SubMenu for Color Options

               <STRONG>+C1</STRONG>     Create a colormap from the first frame of a
                       TrueColor anim and then remap the remaining
                       frames to this colormap. This can potentially
                       add significant time to the startup of an
                       animation but usually results in better colors.
                       The animation needs to be buffered for this
                       option to work. Not valid for TrueColor or
                       DirectColor displays(nor is it needed).

               <STRONG>+C3</STRONG>     Convert TrueColor anims to 332(StaticColor).
                       TrueColor anims are animations that provide
                       separate RGB info for each pixel, rather than
                       each pixel being an index into a global
                       colormap. AVI(16bit CRAM), QT(RPZA and RLE
                       depth 16 and 24) and URT RLE 24 bit anims are
                       examples of TrueColor anims. This option is
                       ignored for TrueColor or DirectColor displays.

               <STRONG>+CA</STRONG>     Create a colormap from each frame of a
                       TrueColor anim. This can be useful if the
                       colors radically change during the course of
                       the animation. This can take a VERY,VERY long
                       time at start up. Animation must be buffered.
                       This option is ignored for TrueColor or
                       DirectColor displays.

               <STRONG>+Ca</STRONG>     Remap all images to single new cmap created
                       from all of the colormaps.

               <STRONG>+Cd</STRONG>     Use Floyd-Steinberg dithering if needed for
                       non-monochrome displays.  This will cause a
                       reduction in playback speed.

               <STRONG>+Cf</STRONG>     Forcibly remap to all frames to 1st frame's
                       cmap.

               <STRONG>+CF0</STRONG>    Disables +CF4.

               <STRONG>+CF4</STRONG>    This option samples the colors of true color
                       animations ahead of time and forms a color
                       lookup table.  Beats the just truncating to a
                       RGB 332 color table and IMHO beats dithering.
                       See the +s option below(also in copts submenu).
                       NOTE: this is now on by default.

               <STRONG>+Cg</STRONG>     Convert TrueColor anims to gray scale. This
                       option is ignored for TrueColor and DirectColor
                       displays.

               <STRONG>+Ch</STRONG>     Use histogram to aid in color reduction.
                       Histrogramming is only done on frames that are
                       buffered.

               <STRONG>+Cm</STRONG>     This option is currently needed if you want to
                       dither TrueColor anims to a 332 colormap.
                       Animation must be buffered. Typically +bC3dm is
                       the option to use. This can take a VERY long
                       time at start up.

               <STRONG>+Cn</STRONG>     Don't create new colormap but instead allocate
                       colors from the X11 Display's default cmap.

               <STRONG>+Cs</STRONG><EM>num</EM>  This is the number of frames the +CF4 option
                       looks at ahead of time. More frames potentially
                       yields better colors results, but takes more
                       time at start up.  default is 5.

          <EM>gopts</EM> SubMenu for Gamma Options

               <STRONG>+Ga</STRONG><EM>fnum</EM> Set gamma of animation to be displayed.

               <STRONG>+Gd</STRONG><EM>fnum</EM> Set gamma of display. 1.0 is no change. gamma's
                       greater than 1.0 typically brighten the
                       animation.

          <EM>mopts</EM> SubMenu for Median-Cut Quantization Options

               <STRONG>+Ma</STRONG>     compute box color from average of box.
               <STRONG>+Mc</STRONG>     compute box color as center of box.

               <STRONG>+Mb</STRONG><EM>num</EM>  Truncate rgb to <EM>num</EM> bits before quantizing.

          <EM>sopts</EM> SubMenu for Scaling Options

               <STRONG>+Si</STRONG>     Half the height of IFF anims if they are
                       interlaced.(Not completely reliable since not
                       all IFF anims correctly identify themselves as
                       interlaced).

               <STRONG>+Sn</STRONG>     Prevents X11 window from resizing to match
                       animations's size.

               <STRONG>+Sr</STRONG>     Allow user to resize animation on the fly.
                       Enlarging an animation can greatly reduce
                       playback speed depending on the power of the
                       cpu.

               <STRONG>+Ss</STRONG><EM>fnum</EM> Scale the size of animation by <EM>fnum</EM> before
                       displaying.

               <STRONG>+Sh</STRONG><EM>fnum</EM> Scale the horizontal size of the animation by
                       <EM>fnum</EM> before displaying.

               <STRONG>+Sv</STRONG><EM>fnum</EM> Scale the vertical size of the animation by
                       <EM>fnum</EM> before displaying.

               <STRONG>+Sx</STRONG><EM>num</EM>  Scale the animation to have width <EM>num</EM> before
                       displaying.

               <STRONG>+Sy</STRONG><EM>num</EM>  Scale the animation to have height <EM>num</EM> before
                       displaying.

               <STRONG>+Sc</STRONG>     Copy display scaling factors to display
                       buffering factors.

               <STRONG>+SS</STRONG><EM>fnum</EM> Scale the size of the animation by <EM>fnum</EM> before
                       buffering it.

               <STRONG>+SH</STRONG><EM>fnum</EM> Scale the horizontal size of the animation by
                       <EM>fnum</EM> before buffering it.

               <STRONG>+SV</STRONG><EM>fnum</EM> Scale the vertical size of the animation by
                       <EM>fnum</EM> before buffering it.

               <STRONG>+SX</STRONG><EM>num</EM>  Scale the animation to have width <EM>num</EM> before
                       buffering it.

               <STRONG>+SY</STRONG><EM>num</EM>  Scale the animation to have height <EM>num</EM> before
                       buffering it.

               <STRONG>+SC</STRONG>     Copy buffer scaling factors to display scaling
                       factors.

          <EM>zopts</EM> SubMenu for Special Options

               <STRONG>+Ze</STRONG>     XAnim will exit after playing through command
                       line once.

               <STRONG>+Zp</STRONG><EM>num</EM>  XAnim pause at frame <EM>num</EM> and then wait for user
                       input. Several pauses may be specified. Each
                       group of pauses will only affect the animation
                       immediately following them on the command line.
                       Pauses will occur at least once.

               <STRONG>+Zr</STRONG>     This option enables the Remote Control Window.
                       This overrides the default condition set in
                       xanim_config.h. Remote Control support must be
                       compiled into XAnim for this to work.

          Normal Options

               <STRONG>+b</STRONG>      Uncompress and buffer images before displaying.
                       This only applies to AVI, QT, IFF, FLI, FLC,
                       JPEG, MPEG and DL animations. The rest(GIF87a,
                       GIF89a, PFX and RLE) are currently always
                       uncompressed and buffered. This is cleared by
                       the +f option.

               <STRONG>+B</STRONG>      Used X11 Shared Memory(if present) for
                       unbuffered animations only.(This is mutually
                       exclusive with +b above).

               <STRONG>+f</STRONG>      Don't load anim into memory, but read each
                       section only when needed. This is supported
                       only for AVI, QT, IFF, FLI, FLC, JPEG, MPEG and
                       DL animations. This option is cleared by the +b
                       option.  This saves memory at the cost of
                       speed.

               <STRONG>+c</STRONG>      let xanim know that iff anim is a nonlooping
                       one.

               <STRONG>+d</STRONG><EM>num</EM>   debug switch. <EM>num</EM> can be from 0(off) to 5(most)
                       for level of detail.

               <STRONG>+F</STRONG>      Floyd-Steinberg dithering when needed.

               <STRONG>+j</STRONG><EM>num</EM>   <EM>num</EM> is the number of milliseconds between

          Once the animation is up and running there are various
          commands that can be entered into that animation window from
          the keyboard.

          <STRONG>q</STRONG>         quit.

          <STRONG>Q</STRONG>         Quit.

     <STRONG>BUFFERING,</STRONG> <STRONG>PIXMAPS</STRONG> <STRONG>and</STRONG> <STRONG>READ_FROM_FILE</STRONG> <STRONG>Options</STRONG>
          XAnim by default will read the entire animation into memory.
          PFX, Moviesetter, GIF or URT RLE type animations are always
          uncompressed and stored in memory as individual images.

          For the AVI, QT, IFF, FLI/FLC, JPEG, MPEG and DL animations,
          only the compressed delta is stored. These deltas are then
          uncompressed each time they need to be displayed. The buffer
          option(+b) may be used to potentially speed up playback by
          uncompressing and storing these images ahead of time. But
          more memory is used up in the process.

          When an XPutImage is called, the image typically gets copied
          twice, once to memory and then from there onto the display.
          A pixmap is directly copied onto the display without the
          first copy. This is why it is sometimes much faster to use
          the pixmap option(+p).  Each image isn't converted into a
          pixmap until the first time it is displayed. This is why the
          first loop of an animation using this option is sometimes
          slower than subsequent loops. While the pixmap option may
          improve playback speed, it will slow things down if on-the-
          fly scaling needs to be performed. This is because XAnim no
          longer has direct access to the image and needs to get a
          copy of it before it can be scaled.

          The read from file option(+f) causes XAnim not to store the
          compressed deltas in memory. Instead as each image is to be
          displayed, XAnim reads the corresponding compressed delta
          from the file, expands it and then displays it. While this
          can dramatically cut down on memory usage, the necessary
          reads from disk(or whatever) can slow down playback speed.
          XAnim still needs to allocate one to three image buffers
          depending on the type of animation and the scaling options
          used. This option is only supported for AVI, QT, FLI/FLC,
          IFF, JPEG, MPEG and DL animations. The BODY chunk of IFF
          animations is not included in this. As a result, an IFF
          animation that is made up of several BODY chunks will not
          currently benefit from this option.

     <STRONG>SCALING</STRONG> <STRONG>Options</STRONG>
          There are two sets of scaling options. One set, the display
          scaling factors,  affects the size of the animation as it is
          displayed. The other set, the buffer scaling factors, affect
          the size of the images as they are stored in
          memory(buffered). The buffer scaling factors only affect
          animations that are buffered and can greatly increase or
          decrease memory usage.

          These two sets are completely independent of each other. You
          can set the buffer scaling factors to 20 times the normal
          animation size and not affect the size at which that
          animation is displayed. The images are stored at 20 times
          the normal size(and at 400 times the memory usage), but then
          get scaled back down to normal size before being displayed.
          NOTE: that an animation must be buffered in order for the
          buffer scaling factors to have any affect on it. The display
          scaling factors affect all animations.

          You can create pixellation like affects by buffering the
          animation at 1/8 it's normal size, but keeping the display
          scaling factors at the original size. (IE "xanim +bSS0.125
          anim.anim").

          Many times it's faster to store and display an animation
          with large dimensions at half-size. The option "+bSS0.5C" or
          "+bSS0.5s0.5" both will accomplish this. To save memory, you
          could even store the animation at half size and yet display
          it at full size. "+bSS0.5" will accomplish this.

     <STRONG>FORWARDS,</STRONG> <STRONG>BACKWARDS</STRONG> <STRONG>and</STRONG> <STRONG>OPTIMIZATION.</STRONG>
          Many type of animations(FLI/FLC/IFF/some AVI and QTs) are
          compressed with forward playback in mind only. Each delta
          only stores the difference between the current frame and the
          previous frame. As a results, most of these animations don't
          display correctly when played backwards.  Even when buffered
          up, these may not work, since XAnim only stores the smallest
          rectangle that encompasses the changes from the previous
          frame. You can force XAnim to store the entire frame by
          specifying the "-o" option to turn this optimization off.
          This will most likely use more memory and slow down the
          animation, since more of the image needs to be stored and/or
          displayed.

     <STRONG>COLOR</STRONG> <STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
          Most of this will be a TBD for a future rev and what's here
          might be sketchy, incomplete or just plain confusing.

          TrueColor and DirectColor displays don't need to worry about
          most of these options, as the animations can be displayed in
          their original colors(ignoring monitor variations etc).
          However, TrueColor and DirectColor displays can't display
          animations that employ color cycling techniques where the
          colormap changes from frame to frame.  DirectColor could
          potentially support this, but not TrueColor.

          For the rest of the displays, the problem becomes matching
          the colors in the animations to the available colors of the
          Display.  For most PseudoColor displays this means 256
          colors. Many of which are already in use by various other
          programs. XAnim defaults to creating it's own colormap and
          using all the colors from that. The window manager then
          installs this new colormap, whenever the mouse pointer is
          inside the XAnim animation window(Sometimes a specific
          action is required to change the ColorMap Focus, like
          clicking in the window or pressing a specific key). In any
          case, this action usually causes all the other colors on the
          screen to be temporarily "messed-up" until the mouse is
          moved out of the animation window. The alternative, is to
          use the "+Cn" option. Now XAnim tries allocating all the
          colors it needs from the current colormap. If it can't get a
          certain color, then XAnim choose one that is "close" to this
          certain color. Close is completely arbitrary. The animation
          is now displayed in colors that are different than the
          original colors. This difference may or may not be
          noticeable.

          Another big problem is when the animations are what I called
          TrueColor animations. Where each pixel is stored as RGB
          triplets. For example, AVI 16 bit CRAM animations. Each
          pixel has 5 bits of Red, 5 bits of Green and 5 bits of Blue
          info associated with it. This means there can be up to 32768
          unique colors in each image. And on most PseudoColor
          displays we can only display 256 unique colors. Beside
          getting better displays, what can we do? XAnim defaults to
          truncating the RGB information from 555 to 332. That is to 3
          bits of Red, 3 bits of Green and 2 bits of Blue. Less on
          Blue because the human eye is more sensitive to Red and
          Green than Blue.  This 332 colormap happens to be 256 colors
          in size, which nicely fits in with our display. If our
          display only had 64 colors, then XAnim is smart enough to
          truncate things down to 222. Now the problem is the colors
          of the displayed anim are noticeably different than the
          original colors.  Typically you can see color banding etc.
          While this is fine to get a feel for the animation, we can
          do better. One of the solutions XAnim currently offers is
          the "+bC1" option. What this does is choose the the best 256
          colors from the first image of the animation. Then each
          pixel of each subsequent image is remapped to one of these
          256 colors.  This takes up some CPU time up front and more
          memory since each image needs to be buffered, but results in
          a colors that are closer to the originals.  Another option,
          "+bCA", chooses the best 256 from each image, then 256
          colors from all these colormaps are chosen as the final
          colormap.  This is useful if the colors in the first image
          aren't representative of the rest of the animation. This can
          be very slow. Another option that is supported, but not
          really optimized for yet is "+bC3dm". This causes XAnim to
          use a 332 colormap and then apply a Floyd-Steinberg dither
          algorithm to each image.  Currently this is very slow.
          Different dithers(like Ordered) and better optimizations
          might speed this up in future revs. In general, handling of
          TrueColor animations in XAnim needs to be improved.

          Another scenario where colors need to be remapped, is when
          several images or animations with different colormaps need
          to be displayed.  Changing the colormap usually results in
          an annoying flicker. One solution to this is to remap all of
          the images/animations to the same colormap. The "+Ca" option
          chooses the best colors from all the colormaps and then
          remaps all the images to it. The "+Cf" option, simply remaps
          everything to the first colormap.  The "+Ch" option is
          useful when an animation's colormap specifies a lot of
          colors that aren't used. XAnim looks through each buffered
          image of the animation and makes a histogram of the useage
          of each color. This information is then used to weedout
          unused or rarely used colors.

     <STRONG>QUICKTIME</STRONG> <STRONG>ANIMATIONS</STRONG>
          Quicktime animations are usually stored in two separate
          files. One is call a data fork and ends with a ".data". The
          other is a resource fork and ends in a ".rsrc". Sometimes
          these animations are in a "flattened/merged fork" format,
          where everything is put into one file. There's no standard
          naming format for these types of files, although usually .qt
          or .mov is used.

          For example, if you have a quicktime animation made up of
          two files named: "spin.rsrc" and "spin.data",  you can
          display them using Xanim with either of the following
          commands "xanim spin" or "xanim spin.rsrc".  XAnim is smart
          enough to add/modfiy the ".rsrc" and ".data" endings as
          needed.

          If you use AUFS from the Columbia Appletalk Package, then
          Macintosh files have their data fork stored in the expected
          place, and the resource fork is in a file with the same name
          in a .resource subdirectory. Therefore, if the data fork is
          in "spin", and the resource fork is in ".resource/spin", the
          movie can be displayed with "xanim spin".

          For "flattened/merged_fork" quicktime animations, you need
          to specify the entire file name.

          NOTE: XAnim doesn't support 100% of the quicktime format.
