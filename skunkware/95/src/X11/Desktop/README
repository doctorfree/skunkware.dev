The files in this directory represent my personal tailoring of the
SCO OpenServer Release 5 X.Desktop, SCO Panner and Session Management.

In order to use these files, they need to be installed in your home
directory. To do so, you can type "xmkmf; make installxp"
or just execute the Install shell script in this directory (e.g. type
"sh Install").

The contents of this directory are as follows :

	Pmwm and .pmwmrc - configure SCO panner for use with Skunkware 5.0
	.xdt_dir and .odt_pref - configure X.Desktop 

I have configured the pmwm root menu so that a number of cascading pop-up
menus are available. I have also configured the button bindings so that
you do not need to hold the mouse button down to keep the pop-up menus up.
Instead, you just click and the menu pops up. To get it to pop-down, just
click on a window (e.g. the panner box or a scoterm).

If you don't want to use X.Desktop and would rather just run pmwm with
a scoterm, then install .startxrc in your home directory. To do so, either
type "xmkmf; make installstartx" or type "sh Install startx".
Installing this .startxrc will cause your session to ignore the files in
.xdt_dir and .odt_pref. 

If you just want the SCO panner configuration files, either type 
"xmkmf; make installpmwm" or type "sh Install pmwm". If you just want the
X.Desktop configuration files and not the SCO Panner files, type
"xmkmf; make installxdt" or type "sh Install xdt".

Hope you enjoy and feel free to send feedback, improvements, comments, bug
reports and compliments to rr@sco.com.
