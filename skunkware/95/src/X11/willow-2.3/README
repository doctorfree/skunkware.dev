          Building and Installing Willow Source Code

This file contains instructions for how to build and install the
Willow source code distribution, and a description of the included
files.

Note that there are pre-compiled Willow binaries available for a
variety of platforms. If binaries for your platform exist, we
recommend that you use them rather than try to compile yourself.
Currently available are binaries for DEC/Ultrix, IBM/RS6000-AIX,
Sun/Solaris, and Sun/SunOS.

Building Willow
===============
0. Executive summary of the next 12 steps:
      Get and unpack the distribution
      Edit the file "Config"
      imake  /* with no arguments! */
      make world
      make install

1. If you have not done so already, the first step is to join one of
   the two Willow mailing lists, so that you can be informed of new
   releases of Willow. It is crucial that you install new versions in
   a timely manner, because old versions are sometimes unable to
   connect to the host databases.

   To join the "willow-info" public mailing list for Willow release
   announcements and general Willow discussion, send a request to:
      willow-info-request@cac.washington.edu

   If you want to receive release announcements only, you can join the
   "willow-announce" list by sending a request to:
      willow-announce-request@cac.washington.edu

2. Next, you must ftp the Willow source distribution from
   ftp.cac.washington.edu, in the willow directory. There are
   different versions of the Willow distribution for different types
   of user -- University of Washington, NorthWestNet, and everybody
   else. Go to the appropriate sub-directory for your class -- uw,
   nwnet, or public, and get willow.src.tar.Z (be sure to transfer in
   binary mode).

3. Uncompress the file. Just execute the command 
      uncompress  willow.src.tar.Z
   and the file will be replaced by willow.src.tar.  

4. Un-tar the file. Execute the command
      tar xvf willow.src.tar
   and a directory called willow will be created, with all the
   necessary files underneath it. 

5. Hopefully, everything you need to modify in order to successfully
   build Willow and its drivers is isolated into the file Config. Open
   that file in your favorite editor, and follow the instructions
   there to configure it for your particular site.

6. From the willow directory, type the command "imake" with no
   arguments (if you do not have imake on your system, get it). The
   Willow distribution does not use the X11 config files, so do not
   use xmkmf. There should now be a file called "Makefile" in the
   willow directory. If you find you need to go back and modify the
   Config file again, be sure to use imake to regenerate your Makefile
   afterwards.

7. Type the command "make world". This will first execute the
   "Makefiles" target to create Makefiles in each of the source
   sub-directories, then the "programs" target to run the Makefiles
   and build the programs. So far, Willow has been successfully built
   on DEC/Ultrix, IBM RS6000, Sun/Solaris, SunOS, 386/BSD, DEC/vax
   (BSD 4.3), and HP/UX. Feel free to contact us if you have problems
   building. And we encourage you to send us back any fixes you come
   up with for future releases.  Once everything is built, if you wish
   to run Willow from the source directory you must be sure to set the
   "Willow*willowDir" resource as described in the file
   doc/Customization. Creating a temporary link from /usr/lib/X11/willow
   to your source directory will also work.

8. Install willow in its final resting place by typing "make install".
   Note that unless you own the installation, binary, and man-page
   directories as described in Config, this step will require you to
   become root in order to run.

   You may want to do a "make -n install" to preview what "make install"
   will do. Basically it is the following steps...
     If there is already an installed willow.old directory, remove it.
     If there is already an installed willow directory, move it to
       willow.old. 
     Create the installation directory (usually /usr/local/willow).
     If /usr/lib/X11/willow already exists as symbolic link, remove it. 
     If your installation directory is anything than other than
       /usr/lib/X11/willow, create a symbolic link from
       /usr/lib/X11/willow to your installation directory.
     Copy the necessary files to your installation directory.
     If there already is a link called willow in your binary
       directory, remove it.
     Create a symbolic link called willow in your binary directory to
       the willow executable in your installation directory.
     Copy doc/willow.man to willow.1 in your manual page directory.

   If you are a file-system purist, and do not even want a symbolic
   link in /usr/lib/X11, you can remove the /usr/lib/X11/willow link,
   but then you will have to use resources to change the default
   Willow directory. See doc/Customization for more information.

9. Make sure that you have the Free Software Foundation's "gunzip"
   decompression program available on your system. The help bitmap
   files are stored in gzipped format, and gunzip is required for
   Willow to read them. If you do not have it, the gzip package is
   available via ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu in pub/gnu. Note that Willow
   will run fine without gunzip until you press a Help button, so you
   can save this step for later.

   By default, Willow will create an external gunzip process each time
   a help screen is viewed. If you find that this extra CPU usage is a
   problem on your system (this is only likely if you have a large
   number of simultaneous Willow users on the same CPU) then you may
   want to spend the extra disk-space and pre-expand all of the help
   bitmap files. Bitmap files are in the subdirectories of
   willow/help, and the file names are of the form "screen#.gz".  The
   following command line, when run from the willow directory, can be
   used to expand all of the help bitmaps which are currently
   compressed: 
        find help -name "*.gz" -print | xargs gunzip

   Similarly, this command line can be used to re-compress any bitmaps
   that have been expanded:
        find help -name "screen*" -print | grep -v ".gz" | xargs gzip

10.Set up any customized Willow resources you are interested in.
   Willow will run just fine with its fallback resource values, so
   this step is purely optional. The resources a system administrator
   are likely to be interested in are described in doc/Customization.
   If you do want system-wide resources customized, you can create a
   file /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Willow and list those resources.

   Note that Willow depends on certain colors that are only defined in
   Release 4 and newer version of X, so if you still have the R3 color
   database installed, you should update it (/usr/lib/X11/rgb.*).

   Also note that Willow expects to find the standard X11R4 75dpi font
   set available. Even if you are on a 100dpi or higher screen, you
   should be sure to have the 75dpi fonts on your font path. That way,
   Willow will be guaranteed to have the correct appearance. However
   if you are on a high-res (1280x1024 or more pixels) screen, you
   probably want to run Willow in extra-large mode, to take advantage
   of your extra screen real estate. See the file willow.X for more
   information on setting the Willow*size resource.

11.Note that all applications built with Motif 1.1 and higher require
   the presence of the file /usr/lib/X11/XKeysymDB. If when you start
   Willow you see error messages such as 
      "translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym..."
   
   You should install that file. There is a copy available for ftp in
   the pub/willow directory on ftp.cac.washington.edu.

12.Platform-specific peculiarities
   Sun/Solaris:
     The version of telnet currently supplied with Solaris does not
     work properly with Willow's uwbrs driver. A patched telnet is
     available from Sun. Contact Sun support (generally that means
     calling 1-800-USA-4SUN) and ask for patch 101681-01.

     Due to what we think is a bug in the solaris popen() function,
     on-the-fly gunzipping of help screens as described above, fails
     on versions of Solaris earlier than 2.3. In this case you will
     have to pre-gunzip all of the files.


File Contents
=============
The following files are included in the Willow source code
distribution...

Config
   As described above, this is the imake configuration file you must
   edit before you can build Willow on your machine.

Imake.tmpl
   The basic template file needed by imake. You can ignore it.

Imakefile
   The model which imake uses to generate Makefiles. You can ignore it.

README
   You are reading it right now!

db.conf
   The database configuration file. This file tells Willow what
   databases should be listed in the Database menu, and exactly how to
   present this database to the user. See doc/Customization and the
   db.conf file itself, for more information.

doc
   This is a directory which contains supplemental documentation,
   including: 

   CHANGES 
      Summary of the changes for the current version, along with all
      changes since version 2.0.

   COPYRIGHT
      A statement of the University of Washington copyright, along
      with statements from all other institutions which have
      contributed code.

   Customization
      A guide to customizing Willow for your site, including available
      system-wide resources and a description of how to add new
      databases. 

   Tech-Report.ps
      This postscript file is a write-up up of the Willow
      architecture. It might make interesting background reading for
      more technical users, but it is not required. Note that an
      on-line hypertext version of this document is available via
      Mosaic or any other www browser, at the URL:
        http://www.cac.washington.edu/willow

   willow.man
      A manual page for willow.

   willow.X
      This is the X resource template file for Willow. It shows all
      the resources that a user might want to set.

   Z39.50_Supplement
      Contains various supplemental information about using Willow's
      Z39.50 driver. Z39.50 is a standard ANSI protocol for
      information search and retrieval.

drivers
   This directory contains the database-driver programs for all the
   databases that Willow knows how to speak to. The driver is a
   program that translates between Willow and a particular database
   system. For more information, read Tech-Report.ps. 

help
   This is the directory where the text and bitmap files accessed by
   the online help system live by default.

src
   This directory contains subdirectories with the actual Willow
   source code, and source code for the UW-BRS database driver and
   MIT's Z39.50 database driver. See Tech-Report.ps for an explanation
   of exactly what a database driver is.

tools
   This directory contains miscellaneous programs you might find
   useful in conjunction with Willow. Nothing here is strictly
   necessary for getting Willow to run.

uid
   This directory contains binary files which describe portions of the
   willow user interface. They are created with the motif UIL
   compiler. This directory is empty until you actually build Willow.

willow
   This is the Willow program itself. Of course this file does not
   exist until you build it.

xbm
   This directory contains all of the bitmap files that Willow needs
   at run-time.
