<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
"Xarchie is an X11 browser interface to the Archie
Internet information system using the Prospero virtual
filesystem protocol.  Archie provides information about
files available for ftp anywhere on the Internet;
Xarchie displays this information using an easy-to-use,
point-and-click interface.  Xarchie allows you to
further explore ftp sites by examining directories
returned as query matches, and allows you to retrieve
files located this way.  Xarchie is designed (like most
X applications) to be highly customizable, allowing you
to tailor the look-and-feel of the tool to your own
preferences."

2. run "xarchie"
