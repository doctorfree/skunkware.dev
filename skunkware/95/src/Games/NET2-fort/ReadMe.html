<H2>Description</H2>
When fortune is run with no arguments it prints out a random epigram.
Epigrams are divided into several categories, where each category
is subdivided into those which are potentially offensive and those
which are not.
The options are as follows:
<UL> 
  <LI> -a - Choose from all lists of maxims, both offensive and not.
  <LI> -e - Consider all fortune files to be of equal size (see discussion below
        on multiple files).
  <LI> -f - 
    Print out the list of files which would be searched, but don't
        print a fortune.
  <LI> -l - Long dictums only.
  <LI> -m pattern - Print out all fortunes which match the regular expression
            pattern 

  <LI> -o - Choose only from potentially offensive aphorisms.
<P>
Please, please, please request a potentially offensive fortune if and
only if you believe, deep down in your heart, that you are willing   
to be offended.
(And that if you are, you'll just quit using -o rather than give us
grief about it, okay?)
<P>
... let us keep in mind the basic governing philosophy
of The Brotherhood, as handsomely summarized in these words:
we believe in healthy, hearty laughter -- at the expense of 
the whole human race, if needs be.
Needs be.
<br> -- H. Allen Smith, "Rude Jokes"
<P>
  <LI> -s  - Short apothegms only.
  <LI> -i - Ignore case for patterns.
  <LI> -w - Wait before termination for an amount of time calculated from the
number of characters in the message.
This is useful if it is executed as part of the logout procedure
to guarantee that the message can be read before the screen is cleared.

<H2>Build Notes</H2>

This source is configured to be installed under
/usr/skunk.
The datafiles are installed under /usr/skunk/lib/fortune/fortunes.
<P>
If installed elsewhere fortune can be told the new directory with the SKUNK_LIB
enviromnent variable. THis variable if set has "fortune/fortunes" 
appended and is used as the pathname to find the data files ( it defaults to
/usr/skunk/lib).
<P>
To change the default lib modify the pathnames.h header file in the src tree.
<P>
To build it for a different location, compile with
<CODE>make INSTALL_DIR=directory</CODE>.
