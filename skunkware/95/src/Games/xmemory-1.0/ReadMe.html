     <STRONG>NAME</STRONG>
          xmemory - game of memory for several player

     <STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>
          <STRONG>xmemory</STRONG> [small|normal|big] ([display]/[color])*

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          <EM>XMemory</EM> is a multi player memory game. It is played
          simultaenously on several X Displays, which have to be
          listed on the command-line.  To run properly, the access to
          the selected X Displays must be allowed. This can be
          achieved in the usual manner by running <EM>xhost</EM> on the desired
          displays.


     <STRONG>Rules</STRONG>
          Like in the traditional memory game, the players have to
          find similar tiles on the table to get the tiles. The main
          change in this version is, that the players play
          simultaenously and therefor the whole game gets some kind of
          an action game.

          Opening a tile leads to a lock of the tile for about 3
          seconds when opening the first tile. 1 second after opening
          the second tile, both tiles flip back and therefor are
          accessable again for all other players.

          Winner is the player who collected the most matching tiles.


     <STRONG>Size</STRONG> <STRONG>Options</STRONG>
               small:  4x5 grid
               normal: 8x9 grid
               big:    11x12 grid

     <STRONG>Player</STRONG> <STRONG>Specification</STRONG>
          The List of players is a list of the display names. If
          desired, a color can be selected for a display by
          concatinating a slash and the name of the color after the
          display name, e.g.  hgr3:0.0/brown.


     <STRONG>Fonts</STRONG>
          The program tries to use scalable fonts on the displays. If
          the fonts are not found or don't look pretty, check out if
          the fontserver <EM>fs</EM> is running on the display.


     <STRONG>EXAMPLE</STRONG>
