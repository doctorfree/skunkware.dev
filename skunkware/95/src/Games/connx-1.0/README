INTRO

connx is basically just another version of connect-4, go-moku (spelling?),
etc.  Not much originality here.  I wanted to write a client/server 
game using X-Windows that I could play with friends over the net.  
Hopefully, this is just a stepping-stone to some other more advanced
net games I'm working on.  It may not be XPilot, but 
it can be kinda fun (for a little while).


The only thing different about this version is that it allows multiple
players/teams to play what is usually considered a two-player game.
Some people have told me it makes the game interesting.  Some people
have told me it's just stupid.  Either way - Enjoy.

COMPILATION

connx was written using X11R6 on Linux, but there's no reason
why it shouldn't work with R4/R5.  The scalable fonts may not
work correctly, but they should just default to a fixed size.

connx runs on a color display.  There's no code in it to handle
pixmaps of depth 1.  Running it with a mono display adapter will
probably cause the game to crash.

It has been tested (though not thoroughly) on Linux and AIX.
(For AIX, add the -DAIX flag in the Makfile.)
I'd be surprised if it didn't work on any other Unix box.

connx can be compiled to use Unix sockets or TCPIP sockets.
The only reason to used Unix sockets is if you don't have
TCPIP running on your machine (which I didn't when I developed
this under Linux).

PLAYING THE GAME

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the server: connserv <options>


options:

-rows:  how many rows will be on the game board
-cols: how many columns will be on the game board
-conn: number of pieces a player has to connect to win
-gravity: whether pieced fall to lowest unused position (connect 4)
          or stay where you place them (go-moku).
-timeout: how long a player has to move in seconds.

The server brings up a menu which allows you to set all the
options, list connections, start the game, etc.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

have the clients connect: connx -name <player_name> -host <host_to_connect_to>
                              -display <X_Server_to_Use>

Make sure either the Connx.ad resources file is in
/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Connx or the defaults have been
added to your .Xdefaults file.

If -name isn't specified, it defaults to user's account name.
If -host isn't specified, it defaults to the local host.
If -display isn't specified, it defaults to $DISPLAY.
       

Once all the players have connected, use the server to 
start the game.  

Players use the mouse to move their piece and the mouse button
to place it.  Selecting 'Q' will cause them to quit the game.
connx alows the player to resize their window to any size.

The rest is pretty easy to figure out. Actually, so
is all the above.
