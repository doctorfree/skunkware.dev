Ishido is a (questionably) ancient solitare game of matching stone tiles. 
There is a on-line rule screen in the game.  It is known to compile and
work on Suns running SunOS 4.1 and 386/486 systems running ISC SysV.

This archive contains the following files:
    bitmaps  - directory of X11 bitmaps used for the tiles.
    gl.c     - An X11-based graphics library for an extra level of 
               simplicity/portability/flexibility.  Not comprehensive.
    gl.h     - Include file for gl.c.
    ishido.c - The actual source code of the game.

To install ishido:
    1. Edit the Makefile.  Set LIBS for the system you are on, and
       set the high score file and game directory at the top of
       the file.
    2. Type "make install".

To run ishido:
    Type 'ishido -h' for a list of options.

I wrote this game because it's fairly simple and interesting.  It also
gave me an opportunity to do some hacking around with X11 while avoiding
the time-consuming trap of dealing with Xt.  Implementation took most of
a weekend, so there is no great depth to the code.  However, everything
seems to work well and correctly, so I am not inclined to do much more
work on it. Finally, it is always great fun to unlease a new game upon one's 
co-workers just to bring productivity to a crashing halt.

A note on strategy: The best way to get high scores is to work on setting up
four-way matches and ignore all else.  The first two to concentrate on are
the ones you can build around the middle pieces.  Use the corner pieces
for the next four four-way matches.  My office mate can regularly get 4-6
four-way matches, and has gotten as many as eight.

Finally, a disclaimer: This code was developed entirely on my system at
home, and I didn't even think about working this program while at work.
Amdahl has no responsibility for the existence of this program and 
shares none of my political views.
