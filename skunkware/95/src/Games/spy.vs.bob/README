Spy vs "BoB" is a simple arcade game, based on Dodger by Bert Nelson
and an Apple ][ game, Spy vs Spy.  Its been tested with SunOS 4.x, and
should run with minimal changes on any BSD-based UNIX.  Other OS's will
need to come up with another way to handle select().

To install, change the Imakefile to point to the proper scorefile,
xmkmf and make.

The scorefile either needs to be mode 666 or the game should be setuid.
