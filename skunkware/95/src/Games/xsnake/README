Subject: xsnake: AIX X-windows 2D game

Xsnake is another programme if found lying around which I thought some people 
may like.

It is a simple 2D game for X-windows in which you must control the movements 
of a snake around the screen in order to eat rats. As you eat more rats your
tail grows longer and your score increases. Unfortunately this makes the 
game more difficult becuase you must not let the snake touch anything else 
on the screen.

It's based on a very old idea but I can't remember what the game was generally
known as (it was probably just snake) although on the TRS80 it was knows as
hussle. Warning: I find it very addictive.

Since I don't have access to anything else I'm afraid I only have this RS/6000
version. Hopefully it won't be too difficult to port.

Using AIX on an RS/6000 to compile just type

	cc -xsnake.c -o xsnake -lX11

(help text is included).

	Cheers, Dave.
