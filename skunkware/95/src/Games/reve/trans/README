Trans  -  README  -  February 1991.


trans - version 1.0
-------------------


The two files trans.c and trans.ps together form a utility to create
PostScript transcripts from reve's game records. The resulting file can
be viewed with 'pageview' or sent to a PostScript printer.

If the game record format changes, the .c file will need some changes, too.

 If your string contains special characters or consists of more than
 one word, you have to quote it.

 You can use as many options as you like. If you don't use an option,
 a default value is used, as indicated above.
