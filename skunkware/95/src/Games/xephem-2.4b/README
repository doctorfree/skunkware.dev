Welcome to xephem:

Xephem is an interactive astronomical ephemeris program for X Windows systems.
It computes lots of information about the planets and any solar system objects
for which orbital elements are available. A sample database of some 16000+
objects is included in the release kit.  Xephem also displays information about
the moons of Earth, Jupiter and Saturn; Mars' central meridian longitude; and a
subsolar view of Earth. Xephem displays all information in user-configurable
tabular menus as well as with schematic graphical displays. Xephem can also
search for arbitrary circumstances among all objects, generate and display
plots of all computed information and generate tabular listings of all
information.

XEphem requires at least X11R4 and OSF/Motif 1.1 to build (see note below
about a possible bug in X that has been reported). Very few Motif 1.1 features
were used so a back-port to Motif 1.0 should be fairly easy; contact the author
for assistance.

There is only a small manual, but there is extensive on-line help. So, the
first thing to do is to build xephem - see next - then start selecting the Help
buttons.

Building xephem:

    Building xephem is intended to be easy. Everything is in .c and .h files
    in one directory. Just compile everything with the Motif include files and
    link it with the X and Motif libraries as you would any Motif application;
    and don't forget the math library, -lm. A DCL file to build xephem on
    VMS/DECWindows MOTIF is included at the end of this file.
    
    If your system is set up for using xmkmf, then to build xephem just type:

	xmkmf
	make

    If not, there is also a Makefile.simple.

    atof() can be somewhat problematic. It was historically declared to be
    double in math.h. More contemporary systems declare it only in stdlib.h.
    Xephem includes stdlib.h if __STDC__ is defined, else it assumes atof()
    is declared in math.h.  This should work pretty well but if you get
    crazy numbers from xephem check the files that use atof and figure out a
    way to get it declared to return a double. Atof() is called in compiler.c,
    db.c, formats.c, mainmenu.c and satmenu.c.

    Also, on some systems (such as SVR3.2) compile with -D_NO_PROTO and -DSYSV.

    I have searched carefully through the output of running all of xephem
    through lint and gcc on Ultrix and SVR4 and can rationalize all the
    warnings so don't let these bother you.

Running xephem:

    There are fallback resources included in the main program all set to work
    on monochrome systems so don't worry about putting the resource file,
    XEphem.ad, anywhere for now. Another way to run on a black and white
    display is to use the command line arguments: "-fg white -bg black".

    Go ahead and start xephem by just typing it's name: `xephem'.

    The best way to learn xephem is to run it and read some of the Help
    entries. A good order to read them is the way they are listed in the Help
    pulldown off the main menu.  Soon, you will want to edit and install the
    XEphem.ad resources file entries that contain location information and a
    few other things. Read the default resource file, XEphem.ad, and follow the
    notes in there.

Possible X compatibility problem:

    It has been reported that xephem's Sky View and Solar System menus do not
    work using X11R4 twm with X11R4 X. The symptom is that when these views are
    selected an X error occurs as follows:

	X Error of failed request:  BadAccess 
	Major opcode of failed request:  28 (X_GrabButton)
	Minor opcode of failed request:  0

    This does not occur using X11R5 twm with either X11R4 X or X11R5 X nor
    does it occur running mwm with either X11R4 X or X11R5 X. Xephem is known
    to run on the following configurations:


xephem v2.4b is known to run on the following systems; check with the author
for availability of statically linked binary executables.

    OS                      CPU                     X
    -----------             ---------------         ---------------------------
    SVR3.2/Venix            i486                    Metrolink X11R4/Motif 1.1.3
    SVR4.0.3/Consensys      i486                    MIT X11R5/Motif 1.1.4
    Ultrix 4.2              DECstation 5000         DEC's (?)
    SunOS 4.1.2             Sun 4c                  TeleUSE development system
    hpux 8.07               HP 9000/720             X11R4, Motif 1.1.?
    IRIX 4.0.5              SGI                     X11R4
    OSF/1 1.2               DEC Alpha               X11R5, Motif 1.1.3


If you would like to gut xephem for just its astronomical functionality, start
with obj_cir(). This is basically the dividing line between the user interface
and the astronomical functions. Also, the following files are pretty much just
pure transliterations from BASIC into C from machine-readable copies of the
programs in Duffett-Smith's book.  They have nothing to do with the rest of
ephem so they may be used for completely different applications if so desired.

    aa_hadec.c anomaly.c astro.h cal_mjd.c comet.c eq_ecl.c moon.c moonnf.c
    nutation.c obliq.c parallax.c pelement.c plans.c reduce.c refract.c
    sex_dec.c sun.c utc_gst.c

The sample database, ephem.db:

    This is a sample collection of astroids, stars and deep-sky objects to
    get you started. References, when I had them, are included in the file.

    This database is compatible with ephem v4.28 EXCEPT that ephem requires
    entries to start with an alpha character. Either add one to all such
    entries in this db or modify the function nxt_db() to allow a leading digit
    as well.
    
    Asteroids are given by their common name, if it has been assigned, followed
    by their numeric sequence number. Those that do not yet have a common
    name assigned are given by sequence number followed by year and designation
    of discovery. The list goes to 4848.

    The stars are from the Yale Bright star catalogue. Only those entries with
    at least a constellation name and either a common name or some sort of
    designator are included. Bayer designations are given as the Greek letter
    spelled out (I know -- I could have used Greek letters in X but that would
    break compatability with ephem).

    The deep-sky entries are from the Saguaro Astronomy Club database Version
    5.0. The Messier objects are entered twice; once by M number and once
    by NGC number.

    Work on the database is a project in itself. Authoritative contributions
    welcome.

    I have worked up several awk scripts to convert various files into ephem
    format. Contact the author if you need one or have one.

    Finally, I have the entire SAO database from NSSDC broken down it into 10
    files in ephem format. There are total of 258997 entries. The complete
    set is 11332256 bytes, 3034691 compressed. I have put them on export
    near xephem.

Let me know what you think about xephem, good or bad. Thank you.
