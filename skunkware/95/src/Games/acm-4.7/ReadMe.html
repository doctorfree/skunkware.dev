     <STRONG>NAME</STRONG>
          acm - an aerial combat simulator for X

     <STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>
          <STRONG>acm</STRONG> [ <EM>server</EM> ] [ <EM>options</EM> ]

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          acm is an air combat simulator that runs under the X window
          system.  Up to eight players can engage in simultaneous air
          combat.  Players fly jet aircraft equipped with radar, heat
          seeking missiles and cannon.

          The program, "acm", calls a daemon already running on the
          specified server_hostname and requests that your enter the
          game.  The shell variable "ACMSERVER" optionally specifies
          the name of the server host.

          Each player flies something close to either an F-16C Falcon
          or MIG-23.



     <STRONG>USAGE</STRONG> <STRONG>REFERENCE</STRONG>
          To begin play, the flight simulator server must be started
          manually on a system that is accessible to all players.

          The following command line will do that:


               % acms

               The following command line options are recognized by
               acm:

          -geometry geometry_spec
               An X compatible window geometry specification

          -team &lt;1 or 2&gt;
               Specifies the starting airfield.  Airfields are about
               50 nm apart.  Team 1 flies F-16's, team 2 flies MIG-
               23's.

          -dv  Use the X server's default visual for your screen.
               Normally, acm will hunt for a Visual that has a depth
               of eight planes.  It will also create a private
               colormap for acm's use.  If your screen's default
               Visual is an 8-plane PseudoColor Visual, using this
               switch will allow acm to use the "public" Colormap so
               that other windows won't change color when acm is in
               use.


     <STRONG>HOW</STRONG> <STRONG>TO</STRONG> <STRONG>TAKE-OFF</STRONG>
          Your mouse is the control stick.  The neutral position is
          the center of your view display -- denoted by the dot in the
          center of your heads-up-display (HUD).  Moving the mouse
          away from you pitches the plane down, moving it back pitches
          the plane up.  Left and right inputs roll the aircraft in
          the corresponding direction.  On the ground at speeds up to
          100 kts, nose wheel steering guides the aircraft.

          To take off for the first time, select 20 degrees of flaps
          (press H twice), then press the full throttle key (the 4 key
          on the main keyboard).  Keep the mouse in the neutral
          position until you are moving at about 140 kts, then pull
          the mouse about two-thirds of the way down the view window.
          You should pitch up and lift off the ground fairly easily.
          Gradually move the stick closer to the neutral position and
          let your airspeed build -- don't move it back to neutral too
          quickly or you will end up back on the ground again!  As
          your airspeed passes about 250 kts, raise the flaps (press Y
          twice) and landing gear (press G).  Congratulations, you're
          flying a multi-million dollar jet.



     <STRONG>ENGINE</STRONG> <STRONG>CONTROLS</STRONG>
          The following keys control your engine thrust:


               4    Full Power

               3    Increase Power (about 2 percent)

               2    Decrease Power (about the same amount)

               1    Idle Power

               A    Toggle Afterburner

          Your engine gauge displays the power that you are
          generating.  Below that, you have displays showing your
          total fuel remaining as well as your current fuel
          consumption rate.  The afterburner uses fuel at an amazing
          rate; use it wisely.



     <STRONG>LOOKING</STRONG> <STRONG>AROUND</STRONG>
          The keys of the numeric keypad control which direction
          you're looking outside of the cockpit:


                    8 Forward

               4 Left    5 Up 6 Right

                    2 Aft

          It pays to look around when you're in a combat environment.
          Your chances of staying alive increase remarkably.



     <STRONG>THE</STRONG> <STRONG>HEADS</STRONG> <STRONG>UP</STRONG> <STRONG>DISPLAY</STRONG> <STRONG>(HUD)</STRONG>
          On the left side of the HUD is a ladder showing your current
          airspeed in nautical miles per hour (it displays true
          airspeed).  Above that, in the upper left corner, is a G-
          meter.

          The right ladder shows altitude; above that is a readout of
          your current angle-of-attack in degrees ("a=X.X"). Your jet
          will stall at a 30 degrees positive angle of attack and
          negative 16 degrees.

          The airplane symbol (something like "-O-") shows the
          direction that the relative wind is coming from.  The
          relative wind combines your current angles of attack and
          sideslip.  A ladder in the center of the HUD show your
          aircraft's current attitude.

          The lower, horizontal ladder shows your current heading.
          Discretes in the lower left-hand corner show the state of
          your weapons systems.  Slightly above them is a readout of
          your current thrust percentage as well as the state of your
          engine's afterburner -- the "AB" symbol means the
          afterburner is on.



     <STRONG>USING</STRONG> <STRONG>YOUR</STRONG> <STRONG>RADAR</STRONG> <STRONG>DISPLAY</STRONG>
          The radar system has a field of view of 130 degrees
          vertically and side-to-side.  Radar automatically locks onto
          the closest threat in its field of view.  A locked target is
          displayed as a solid block.  Other hostile targets are
          displayed as hollow squares.

          Targetting information is displayed in the lower right
          corner of the display.  The top number is the heading of the
          locked target, the next number is the relative heading you
          should steer to intercept the target (displayed as "ddd R",
          and the third number is the rate that you are closing with
          this target, expressed in knots.

          You can lock onto other targets by pressing the target
          designator key (Q).

     <STRONG>WHO'S</STRONG> <STRONG>GUNNING</STRONG> <STRONG>FOR</STRONG> <STRONG>ME?</STRONG>
          Radar sets that are tracking your aircraft can be detected.
          Your Threat Early Warning System (TEWS) display warns you of
          potential threats.  This circular display shows the relative
          direction of radars (other aircraft) that are looking at
          you.


     <STRONG>ARMAMENTS</STRONG>
          Your aircraft is equipped with heat-seeking missiles and a
          20 millimeter cannon.  Weapon information is displayed in
          the lower left-hand corner of your HUD.  Different weapons
          may be selected by pressing mouse button 3.

          The missiles are patterned after U.S. AIM-9M Sidewinders.
          They can detect infared (IR) targets at any aspect (not just
          from the rear).  Their range varies dramatically with the
          altitude and closure rate.  The missile subsystem couples
          with your radar set to provide time-to-impact information
          when AIM-9's are selected.
