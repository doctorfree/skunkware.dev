0. WHAT DOES "Error: Widget wDiceBox has zero width and/or height" MEAN?
 
   See question 1, the same solution applies.  IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN AS OF
   0.99b3, WHICH HAS DEFAULT RESOURCES!
  
1. WHY IS MY DISPLAY ALL SCREWED UP/HOSED/POKED?

   Is the app resource file XFrisk.ad installed in the right place?  You
   can change the XAPPLRESDIR environment variable to check in the current
   directory by typing something like:

	setenv XAPPLRESDIR /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults:./

   IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN AS OF 0.99b3, WHICH HAS DEFAULT RESOURCES!

2. I CAN'T GET FRISK TO START.  WHY?

   If Frisk is unable to find some of its files, make sure FRISKPATH is
   set to the correct value, and recompile if it changes.

3. HOW DO I START A MULTICLIENT GAME?

   In order to set up a multiclient game, run friskserver on one machine, and
   then run the clients on the remote machines as follows:

	kashmir > friskserver &
	...
	silk > xfrisk kashmir &
	...
	cotton > xfrisk kashmir &

   Clients may start start to register players while the other clients
   join.  Clients can join in at any time, and register players after
   a game has ended.

4. WHAT ABOUT COMPUTER PLAYERS?

   They are coming.  Note the hooks in 0.99b, 0.99c should have the first
   computer player!

5. IT SAYS "Assertion Failure" AND THEN DUMPS CORE.  WHAT DO I DO?

   In general, whenever you get a core dump, it would be greatly 
   appreciated if you sent details to me -- it will result in a more
   robust game for you (I'm happy to fix bugs).  In order to send me
   info, run a debugger on the core file as follows (stuff in [] are
   my comments):
	
	$ dbx [or gdb] server [or client] core  
	dbx> where
		
   If you send the output of the "where" to me, along with a description
   of how it happened, then I'll probably have a fix ready within a day
   or two.  N.B.  You have to have compiled Frisk with debugging in, see
   question 8.

6. I AM FROM PARKER BROTHER AND WANT TO SUE YOU.  WHAT DO I DO?

   Yo no hablo ingles...

7. IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN BUILD FRISK WITH MORE DEBUGGING INFORMATION?

   Yes.  Look in Imakefile, and leave the developer's CDEBUGFLAGS 
   uncommented.  Then remake Frisk.

8. HOW CAN I HELP?

   Until I get computer players up and running, there's really nothing to
   do unless you find a bug and want to send me a bug report.  Patches
   that improve the game will be considered also, based upon their quality
   and desirability.  Patches that are included will be credited.
