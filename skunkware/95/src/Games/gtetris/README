	GENERIC TETRIS
	==============	Yet Another Tetris Game on X, V2.1.4


WHY ANOTHER?

    Because this one is simple, easy to build, and portable -- actually
    the blocks are round-cornered and bigger, more comfortable for your
    eyes. It only uses Xlib -- no "toolkit" kind of thing. People have
    tested it on the following platforms:

	Bull DPX/2		System V	?
	DEC 3100		Ultrix 4.3	X11R3
	DEC 5000		Ultrix 4.2A	X11R4
	DEC Alpha AXP		DEC OSF/1 V1.2	?
	HP 700			HP-UX 8.0x	X11R5
				Mt. Xinu 4.3	X11R5
	IBM RS6000		AIX V3.2	X11R3
	Intel 486DX		Esix 4.0.4	?
				Linux		?
	Iris 4D			IRIX 4.0.1	Motif
	Sun4, SPARC		SunOS 4.1.x	X11R4, X11R5
	Sun SPARC		Solaris 2.1
		add to link: -L/usr/ucblib -lucb -lelf -R/usr/ucblib
	Sequent S81		DYNIX 3.2.0	X11R5
				Dynix/ptx	?

    If your's is not in this list, please let me know -- thanks. The
    most updated source could be found on export.lcs.mit.edu under
    /contrib.

    A System V port (Sequent Dynix/ptx) has been added by
    "Hans-Wolfgang Loidl" <hwloidl@risc.uni-linz.ac.at>. The source can
    be retrieved by anonymous FTP to:

	Host:	melmac.risc.uni-linz.ac.at
	File:	/pub/linux/upload/misc/gtetris3.taz


HOW TO BUILD?

    Edit the Imakefile for appropriate settings of variable SCOREFILE
    and RANDOM, then do:
	xmkmf
	make

    "Tetris" is the game. It only lists the top 15 players at the end,
    each player may has at most three scores. With the option "-s",
    "tetris" will list all the scores.


ANYTHING SPECIAL IN PLAYING?

    Use 'j' to move left; 'l' to move right; 'k' to rotate. Left-handed
    people may want to use 's', 'd', 'f' respectively. Use the space
    bar to drop a block quickly. Do you want to try the arrow keys?

    Use CTRL-L key combination to redraw -- in case the program messes
    somthing up.

    As usual, '+' and '-' will speed up or lower down the speed. Note
    that you don't need to press the SHIFT key -- '=' and '_' also
    work. The 'b' key can be used to toggle "beep" and 'n' toggles
    "show next".

    If you press 'p', the game will be paused, and the window will be
    iconified -- just in case your boss suddenly appears at your door.
    ;o) When the tetris window loses its focus, it also goes to
    "paused" mode except it doesn't iconify itself.

    In previous versions, all number keys on the keypad work. Since I'm
    going to let the user fully configure things like key bindings,
    I'll only let a few of them work for now, and do not include a key
    for "rotate counter-clockwise" (sorry :o).

    Refer to the man page for detailed command line options.

    Since the days of V1.8, I have got many responses over the net.
    Thanks go to people who helped me in improving the program.

  [Nov 13, 92]  Black Friday -- V1.8.1: numerious minor changes. Made
		score listing built in.

  [Oct 08, 92]  V1.8: Corrected some typos, <herbison@erlang.enet.dec.com>.
		Added man-page.  Gregg Townsend <gmt@cs.arizona.edu>
		provided hints for some problems on HP-UX. Imakefile.
		Richard van Denzel suggest modifications for HP-UX.

  [Sep 30, 92]	V1.7: Richard van Denzel <raet-sh!richard@relay.nluug.nl>
		reported bugs on HP-UX 8.0.

  [Sep 27, 92]  V1.6: Changed speed coefficients. Improved window
		manager hints. Several rows at once worth more points.

  [Sep 25, 92]  V1.5: HP-UX fixes by "Richard van Denzel"
		<raet-sh!richard@relay.nluug.nl>. Added 'b' to toggle
		"beep". Rewrote window creation/initialization to fix
		the "losing input focus" problem.

  [Sep 24, 92]  V1.4: Added <sys/select.h> and -lbsd for AIX (by "Daryl
		Green" <darylg@amex-trs.com>).

  [Sep 23, 92]  V1.3: Scoring -- a line in a higher level worth more
		points; "tscores" program. Submitted to
		comp.sources.games (volumn 15, issues 1-2; it has
		nothing to do with GNU, but it was called "gtetris",
		pronounced as "Gee, tetris", by the newsgroup
		moderator).

  [Sep ??, 92]  First set of versions, 1.0 through 1.2 -- developed and
		tested at the University of Arizona. Put on
		export.lcs.mit.edu.

		I studied an old tetris game for X10, wrote by Wayne
		Christopher <faustus@cs.berkeley.edu> in 1988; then I
		adopted the ideas in representing those "blocks" and
		rotating them, and added X11 stuff.  Also I learned a
		lot from Nathan Sidwell's great game "xmris", e.g.  the
		"iconifying pause".
