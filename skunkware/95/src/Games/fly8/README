This archive has the full sources for all the platforms. Some special
msdos support is in a separate archive.

After unzipping it (make sure the directory structure is created) do:

msdos
=====

>msdos\config c8

For the c8.00 (vc 1.0/1.5) compiler, or try c7 (c7.00) or qc (QuickC).
Now it also has 'b4, 'b3' and 'b2' for the Borland C compilers.

Now you can do 'nmake all'. Finally do 'nmake install' to get a proper
execution directory. You will need to have cpp.exe and awk.exe which are
included in the msdos binary release.

The executable will be compressed with lzexe, if you do not have it then
remove these lines from the makefile (both at the top and in the /msdos
directory).

With Borland C, 'make' suffrered a horrible death just looking at the
makefile, so I use other make programs for that. 'b4' only worked from the
command line and even then had some difficulties.

Recently using Qc became a problem as Qlink ran out of segments.


msdos/djgpp
===========

>djgpp\config dj

There is now a DJGPP port in the DJGPP directory. It was tested with 1.10
and 1.11. Note that it does not support double buffering except for
ET4000 cards or VESA compatible BIOSes.


unix/X11
========

Please look at the readme file in the unix directory. It was tested on
Linux and Sun SparcStation.


Amiga
=====

Used to work but I have no machine to test on. But the (untested, and now
badly out of date) sources are included.


mswin
=====

>mswin\config c8

Supported and works. However, it is very slow and not recommended (I tested
it on a Diamond Stealth Pro with 2MB on a 486DX2/66 and it was SLOW.


Good news, Michael did a WinG port and it is much faster, actually
playable. To build use:

>mswin\config c8g
