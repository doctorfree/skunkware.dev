Q1  After unzip on unix the directory have lower-case names.
A   True, the readme says to run 'unix/setfly8'; it renames some files. have
    a look at the 'readme' in the platform directory that you want to use.

Q2  I had a look at the files and there are many ^M there.
A   On unix use the '-xa' switch when unzipping source files. Source files are
    in fly8???1 (source tree). On newer versions use -La switches.

Q3  I cannot unzip the archives.
A   Get the unzip program and build it. I put a copy of it in /pub/ise/eyal/zip.
    You can use the msdos unzip or pkunzip too.

Q4  The msdos makefile cannot find 'lzexe'; what do I do?
A   remove that line (and the following 'del'). 'lzexe' is not essential.

Q5  Compiling the DJgpp version hangs on 'hud.c'.
A   The latest version 1.12pl2 seems to hang. The optimization needs to be
    reduced, so before making all, compile hud.c:
	make SHFLAGS=-O1 hud.o
	make all install

Q6  When I compile Fly8 I get errors about casts on lvalues in assignement.
A   You need to apply patch 1.
