The main source code for this does not carry a copyright
statement.  This probably means it is protected under
the Berne convention.

I have obtained the permission of the author to put this

My general idea of the distribution is to make it similar to the GNU
copyleft system. This means you can freely use it and distribute it
and you are encouraged to make the source available at the same place.

Unlike GNU, I do not insist that, when you use parts of Fly8 in your system,
you owe me anything except leave some credit there.

This, in effect, means that you can keep the copyright to your system
even if it uses parts of Fly8, but you cannot claim copyright to these
parts in Fly8 itself or in anyone else's system that uses them.

If you want to put in on the CD as is, then you do not claim copyright,
and neither do you have to consider me since this is acceptable free
redistrubution of the package. It is OK to drop the troublesome modules.

I hope this clarifies the situation.

The "troublesome" modules referenced are files that are in the
DOS and UNIX/js directories that contain copyright statements
without granting redistribution rights.  These have been deleted
from this release.

They are available with the original source code at the main
FTP site.
