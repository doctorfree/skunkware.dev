<H2>Description</H2>
       Expect is a program that "talks" to other interactive programs
        according to a script.  Following the script, Expect
       knows what can be expected from a  program  and  what  the
       correct  response should be.  An interpreted language provides  
       branching  and  high-level  control  structures  to
       direct  the dialogue.  In addition, the user can take control 
       and interact directly when desired, afterward returning 
       control to the script.
<P>
       Expectk  is  a  mixture of Expect and Tk.  It behaves just
       like Expect and  Tk's  wish.   Expect  can  also  be  used
       directly  in  C or C++ (that is, without Tcl).
