The history page displays all of the links that
you have travelled through to reach your
current point.  If you entered a document and
then left it using the left arrow, it will not
be in the history stack.  If you entered a
document and left it by selecting another link
it will be in the history stack.  You may <A HREF="movement_help.html">select</A>
any link on the history page to return you to a
document that you have previously visited.
