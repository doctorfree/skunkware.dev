<h1>+++DIRED HELP+++</h1>
<br>
Lynx changes into Dired mode when you use a URL of the type <code>
//localhost/path/</code>.  While in Dired mode, some keys are 
remapped to do the following functions:
<pre>
	C)reate       -	Create a new, empty file in the current 
			directory.  You will be prompted to enter 
			a name for the file.

	D)ownload     -	Download selection using options listed in 
			the download options screen.

	E)dit         -	Spawn the editor defined in the <a href="option_help.html">options screen</a>
			and load selection for editing.

	F)ull menu    -	Show a full menu of commands for currently 
			selected file or directory.

	M)odify       -	Modify the name or location of selection.  If
			multiple files have been selected, you will
			only be able to change the location.  Choose
			between changing the name or location and then
			enter a new filename or path.

	R)emove       - Delete currently selected files.

	T)ag          -	Tag the highlighted file.  Multiple files may 
			be tagged and all other commands except "Create" 
			will be performed on tagged files instead of the 
			one highlighted.  Press 't' again to untag a file.

	U)pload       - Upload a file to the current directory using
			one of the options listed in the upload
			options screen.
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> Dired mode must be activated at compile time by the
system administrator.  Otherwise, the above commands will not be available
and lynx will treat a directory listing as a HTML file.<p>
