After entering the 'p' command you will be
presented with a list of print options.
In all cases the file will be printed in
ascii format with the hypertext links
removed.  The number of options depends
on the level of printing that your system
allows.  The following print options
may be availible:<p>

<dl>
<dt>Print to a local 
<dd>This allows you to
save the current file as ascii text
to your local disk.  You will be asked
for a path and filename to save the
file to.  If no path is given, the file
will be saved to the directory that you
were in when you began Lynx.

<dt>Print to the screen:
<dd>This option simply
scrolls the entire document up the
screen and is intended for those who
wish to capture the document with
their terminal.

<dt>Mail the file to yourself:
<dd>This option allows
you to mail the file, in ascii form, to
any valid e-mail address.

<dt>Custom print options:
<dd>Any number of
custom print options may be available,
as defined by your system administrator.
