<h1>About Lynx</h1>

Lynx is a fully featured World-Wide Web browser for users on both UNIX and VMS 
platforms who are connected to those systems via cursor-addressable,
character-cell terminals or emulators.  That includes VT100 terminals,
and desktop-based software packages emulating VT100 terminals (e.g.,
Kermit, Procomm, etc.).

Berners-Lee</A> and the other <A NAME=14
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/People.html">CERN World Wide

work on the WWW project, NCSA and the 
<a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/NCSAMosaicHome.html">Mosaic</a> developers, 
and to everyone out in netland who has
contributed to Lynx's development either directly (through comments
or bug reports) or indirectly (through inspiration and development of
other systems).  Also a special thanks to 
<a href="http://www.cc.ukans.edu/cwis/people/Foteos.Macrides.html">Foteos Macrides</a> who
ported much of Lynx to VMS, and to Earl Fogel of the University of
Saskatchewan. Earl implemented the hypertext engine HYPERREZ in the
UN*X environment.  HYPERREZ was developed by Niel Larson of Think.com
and served as the model for the early versions of Lynx which did not
use the WWW libraries and had their own hypertext format.
