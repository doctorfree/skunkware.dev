<p><code>TERM</code> provides several default clients. They include <code>trsh</code>, <code>tmon</code>, <code>tupload</code>, <code>tredir</code>,
<code>txconn</code> and in newer versions <code>trdate</code>, <code>trdated</code>. Furthermore, starting with version 2.0.0 <code>tudpredir</code> is available and from version 2.1.0 <code>tdownload</code> is available. This section will deal with <code>trsh</code>, <code>tmon</code>, <code>tupload</code>, <code>tdownload</code>, <code>trdate</code> and <code>trdated</code>.
The others each have their own section.  No <code>TERM</code> client
will work until you have established a <code>TERM</code> link.</p>
<p><code>tmon</code> is a simple utility to monitor the statistics of your
link.  It prints a time histogram of characters transmitted and
received. It is invoked simply as tmon. Since around
version 1.11, tmon has had a bug that causes some
information to be garbled (??).</p>
<p><code>trsh</code> is similar to <code>rsh</code>. Without arguments, it spawns
an interactive shell on the remote system (<i>i.e.</i> it logs you
in). trsh is one of the primary means of accessing the
remote end of the link via <code>TERM</code>. If given an argument,
trsh executes that argument as a command on the remote
system. For example </p>
<p>
<pre>
  trsh ls
</pre>

would give you a listing of the
files in your home directory on the remote system.</p>
<p><code>tupload</code> will transfer a file, given as its first argument, from local to remote. By default, the files will be put in the
same directory that you invoked <code>TERM</code> from at the other
side. To put files in another directory, give their names as a second
argument to tupload. For example, if I want to put a copy
of the file 'term114.tar.gz' in '/usr/tmp' on the
remote system, I would type </p>
<p>
<pre>
  tupload term114.tar.gz /usr/tmp
</pre>
. </p>
<p>When you use tupload you can use wild cards like in 'tupload a.*'. The shell expands the wild card and tupload is called as 'tupload a.1 a.2 ......'.</p>
<p><code>tdownload</code> will transfer a file, given as its first argument, from remote to local. By default, the files will be put in the
same directory that you invoked <code>TERM</code> from at the local
side. To put files in another directory, give their names as a second
argument to tdownload. For example, if I want to put a copy
of the file 'term114.tar.gz' in '/usr/tmp' on the
local system, I would type </p>
<p>
<pre>
  tdownload term114.tar.gz /usr/tmp
</pre>
.</p>
<p>When you use tdownload you <i>cannot</i> use wild cards like in 'tdownload a.*'. Reason for this is that the remote directory is not available to your local shell when you use tdownload; so your local shell cannot expand the wild cards.</p>
<p><code>trdate</code> is a time setting utility. It reads the time on the remote machine and sets the local clock to the remote time. It must be run as root.</p>
<p><code>trdated</code> is the daemon version of trdate. When it is started in 'rc.local' it is run as daemon in which case it updates the time every 5 minutes (default). Even when there is no <code>TERM</code> connection, this daemon will start up when set in the rc.local. Once a <code>TERM</code> connection is created it starts updating the time.</p>
