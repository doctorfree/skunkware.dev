<p>Before experimenting with <code>TERM</code> it is strongly advised to first read this complete chapter and the INSTALLATION file provided with the package. Also take a look at the manual pages <code>linecheck</code>, <code>(term)test</code> and <code>TERM</code>. This will help you to work easier and faster. </p>

<h2>3.1 <A Name="ss3.1"> Nomenclature </h2>

<p></p>
<p>I assume you are dialling a system through some sort of terminal
server. I use the terms <i>local</i> and <i>remote</i> to refer to the home
and network connected systems respectively (unless I use them to mean
something else :-).</p>
<p><code>TERM</code> provides the local machine, which has no network
connection, but is connected, via a serial line, to a remote machine
which is in turn connected to a network with network services. Let us look at how a machine with a
'traditional' network connection provides these services. First the
user invokes a program, like <code>ftp</code> or <code>telnet</code>, that
requests a network service. What these programs do is make a system
call requesting network services. The operating system then obtains
these services via its network interface (<i>e.g.</i> it sends and
receives packets over the ethernet). SLIP and PPP do exactly this, by
converting your modem line into a network interface, which is in
principle no different from an ethernet. The downside of this is that
these protocols make the modem-connected machine part of the network,
just like any other machine. This implies all the administrative
burdens associated with being a network node (more actually, since the
modem link must also be administered).</p>
<p>In the absence of a network connection like SLIP or PPP, what does one
typically do? Well, you dial your network connected machine, read
your mail, your news etc; if you need a file, you first transfer it to
the remote machine and then download it to your local machine using
<code>kermit</code> or some other communication program. This is a bit of a pain, especially since
you can only really do one thing at a time that uses your modem link.
The idea behind <code>TERM</code> is basically to automate and multiplex
this process. <code>TERM</code> is invoked on both the local and remote
machines, and the two processes communicate with one another over the
modem line. When you need a network service, you make a request to the
local <code>TERM</code> daemon, which forwards the request to the
<code>TERM</code> daemon on the remote, network-connected, machine. The
result is then returned over the modem line.</p>
<p>To be more concrete, say you want to retrieve a file by <code>ftp.</code>
First you need a version of <code>ftp</code> that can speak to
<code>TERM</code>. You invoke this <code>termftp</code> as you do a regular
<code>ftp</code>, say <code>termftp nethost.gov</code>, but this special
version makes its network request to the local <code>TERM</code> daemon
instead of the kernel. The local <code>TERM</code> forwards this request,
over the modem line, to the remote <code>TERM</code>, which opens an ftp
connection to <code>nethost.gov</code>, and transmits the data back over
the modem link. <code>TERM</code> is smart enough to have many different
things going on at once; so you can have several different network
sessions using the same modem link, <i>e.g.</i> you can be logged
into another distant host via <code>termtelnet</code> while the <code>termftp</code> transfer is going on.</p>
<p>If this is too abstract (or unclear) do not worry; the important piece
of information to get out of this section is that there are <i>two</i> copies of <code>TERM</code> running, one on each end of the modem
link.</p>
