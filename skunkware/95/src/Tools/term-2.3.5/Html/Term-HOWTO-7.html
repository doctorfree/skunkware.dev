<p></p>
<p><code>tredir</code> is one of <code>TERM</code>'s most powerful utilities,
allowing most important network services to be performed over a <code>TERM</code> link. Before we explain how to use tredir, it is
necessary to give some background on network services. We have talked
about network services before, but we have not said exactly what they
are. Services are just that - services that are provided by the
network. Examples of services include <code>telnet</code>, which provides
logins between machines, the File Transfer Protocol, <code>ftp</code>,
which transfers files between machines, and smtp, the Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol, which is used whenever you send electronic mail.
Each network service has a <i>port number</i> associated with it.
The mapping of port numbers to services is given in the file
'/etc/services'. This file should be the same on all
internet-connected machines.</p>
<p>How are these services invoked? Each networked machine runs a daemon
called <code>inetd</code>, which listens for attempts to connect to the
network ports. These requests can come from either the network or the
local machine. A network service is obtained by connecting to a
particular inetd port.  When a network request is made,
inetd knows exactly which service is involved by the port
number the request is made on. If inetd is configured to do
so, it provides the relevant service to the requesting
connection. inetd's configuration is given by the file '/etc/inetd.conf', which has a list of the services that inetd provides. For more information, see the man pages for inetd and inetd.conf.</p>
<p>You can communicate directly with network services by using
<code>telnet</code> (<i>n.b.</i> not <code>termtelnet</code>). For example,
to talk to the <code>sendmail</code>, (or smtp) daemon on machine
<code>machine_name</code>, you can do a <code>telnet machine_name smtp,</code>
or <code>telnet machine_name 25</code>, (since 25 is the number assigned
to smtp in '/etc/services'). You should get a polite greeting
from the daemon on the remote machine. This is a very useful trick for
debugging network problems and checking ports redirected with tredir (see below).</p>
<p>Tredir works very much like inetd. It runs in the
background as a daemon, listening to the network ports, waiting for a
request. When a request for a service is made, instead of providing
that service, as inetd does, tredir forwards the
request over the <code>TERM</code> link to the remote <code>TERM</code>, which
makes the request over the network, returning the result back over the
link to the local client. Tredir can forward the request to
any machine on the network, but by default sends it to the machine at
the other end of the <code>TERM</code> link. Tredir <i>redirects</i> TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) network services over the <code>TERM</code> link.</p>
<p>The common command format of tredir is:</p>
<p>
<pre>
  tredir [this_computer:]port [that_computer:]port
</pre>
</p>
<p>An example should make this clear. Let us redirect a local port to the
telnet port on the remote machine. To do this we would do </p>
<p>
<pre>
  tredir 2023 23
</pre>
</p>
<p>Now, anyone who connects to port 2023 on the local
machine will be redirected to port 23 (telnet) on the remote machine.
Here is an example session; the local machine is <code>mymachine.modem.home</code> and the remote machine is <code>netsun</code>.</p>
<p>
<pre>
 
  $ tredir 2023 23 
  Redirecting 2023 to 23 
  $ telnet localhost 2023 
  Trying 127.0.0.1... 
  Connected to mymachine.modem.home 
  Escape character is '^]'. 


  SunOS UNIX (netsun)
  login: 
</pre>
</p>
<p>This example is actually quite useful. If I were instead to do the
tredir on <code>netsun</code>. I could then telnet in to <code>mymachine</code> from the network simply by connecting to the redirected port on
the networked machine (using telnet) - <i>i.e.</i> <code>telnet
netsun 2023</code>.</p>
<p>The general principle in using tredir is to redirect the
desired service to a machine on the network. Our next example will
allow us to read news on the local machine over our <code>TERM</code> link
from a news server on the network. News is provided by the nntp
service, port number 119.  All decent news readers allow you to specify
what port number they will use, either via a configuration file or an
environment variable. Let us specify this local port to be 2119. Now,
let us say that our news server is <code>news.domain.org</code>. We will
redirect port 2119 to port 119 on <code>news.domain.org</code>; we will
then tell our news reading software that the nntp server is located at
port 2119 on the local host. Since this will depend on the news reader
that you use, I will just test the link with <code>telnet</code> instead
of firing up a news reader:</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ tredir 2119 news.domain.org:119
  Redirecting 2119 to news.domain.org:119 
  $ telnet localhost 2119 
  Trying 127.0.0.1... 
  Connected to mymachine.modem.home. 
  Escape character is '^]'. 
  200 news.domain.org InterNetNews NNRP server INN 1.4 07-Dec-41 ready 
  (posting ok). 
</pre>
</p>
<p>If you can get this far, all you have to do is configure your news
reader to be able to read news via <code>TERM</code>. (<i>n.b.,</i> if
you read news like this, be sure that in all your posts you set a
Reply-To: header to an network email address that you can be reached
at, otherwise people who want to get in touch with you will be sending
mail to whatever (wrong) data your news reader puts in the From:
header).</p>
<p></p>
<h2>7.1 <A Name="ss7.1"> <code>tredir</code> can bite! </h2>

<p></p>
<p>The astute reader, after reading the last example will be wondering
why port 2119 was redirected to port 119 - since news readers default
to port 119, why could I not do a <code>tredir 119 news.domain.org:119</code> and skip the news reader configuration? The answer is that all
ports numbered less than 1024 are ``reserved ports'', and only the
superuser can listen to them. If one is willing to take a security
risk and make tredir an SUID program, or run tredir as root, then one can redirect reserved ports and avoid the
hassle of renaming services.</p>
<p>Another problem with using reserved ports is that inetd is
often already listening to these ports, and only one program at a time
can listen to a port. In order to use such a port, you must change
'inetd.conf' so that inetd no longer listens to the
port you want to redirect. This is most easily done by commenting out
the line with the offending service by putting a <code>#</code>
character at the beginning of the line. The superuser must then send
inetd a HUP signal (kill -1 inetd-pid) to get it to reread its configuration.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>7.2 <A Name="ss7.2"> Stupid <code>tredir</code> tricks </h2>

<p></p>
<p>In this section we will describe some of the more common uses for tredir. We have already described how to redirect nntp and
telnet services; here we will give some more complicated examples.</p>
<p></p>
<h3> X windows </h3>

<p></p>
<p>In a previous section, we described how to get an X client running on
the network to open a window on your home machine using <code>txconn</code>. The same technique could be used on your home machine to display
a client on the machine at the remote end of your <code>TERM</code> link.
But how does one display an X client on a network machine that is not
the remote end? The answer lies in knowing that X uses a particular
network service just like the other programs we have been discussing. An
X server listens for a network request on a port whose number is given
by the formula <F> port = 6000 + display number</F>, <i>e.g.</i> an X
server managing screen 0 on a machine would listen to port 6000, if it
were managing screen 2, it would listen to port 6002.  When you set
your DISPLAY environment variable to <code>xmachine:n</code>, your X
clients will try to connect to port <F>6000 +n</F> on <code>xmachine</code>.</p>
<p>We can use this to trick X clients on your local machine to open up
windows on remote displays. Let us say I want to open up an <code>xterm</code>, running on my local machine, on display 0 of machine <code>xmachine</code>, which is running some place on the network. I first
pick a local display number, say 2 (do not use 0, since that is what
your local X server will be using). I will map this display to display
0 on <code>xmachine</code>. In terms of ports, this means I want to
redirect the local port 6002 to the remote port 6000.  I do the
following</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ tredir 6002 xmachine:6000 
  $ setenv DISPLAY localhost:2
  $ xterm 
</pre>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>This should open up an <code>xterm</code> on machine <code>xmachine</code>.
Note that I set the DISPLAY to <code>localhost:2</code>. This is because X
clients will sometimes use unix domain sockets instead of internet
domain sockets, at their own option, when connecting to a local
display, if DISPLAY is set to <code>:2</code>. <code>localhost:2</code> says
to use a TCP connection.</p>
<p>Note that as far as <code>xmachine</code> is concerned, the X request is
coming from the machine on the remote end of your <code>TERM</code> link
(<code>remotemachine</code>) - so if you need to authorize the connection,
you should either do an <code>xhost + remotemachine</code> on <code>xmachine</code> or use xauth to update the '.Xauthority' file on your local machine for display number 2, using the key
from <code>xmachine</code>.</p>
<p>Again, to speed up X connections, you can use the program sxpc, which includes an explanation of how to use tredir
to establish the link and authorize it using xauth.</p>
<p></p>
<h3> Mail with <code>TERM</code> </h3>

<p></p>
<p>Well, you asked for it. Electronic mail has the justifiable
reputation of being one of the most difficult things to get working
right on a UNIX system. To really get <code>TERM</code> working
correctly with mail means that you have to understand how mail works,
which is beyond the scope of this document. To learn more about mail,
you should consult a book on UNIX system administration and/or the
comp.mail.misc FAQ, available for anonymous ftp on rtfm.mit.edu:pub/usenet/comp.mail.misc. There are also currently two
packages available for anonymous ftp on sunsite.unc.edu that will help you get mail running under <code>TERM</code> - they are
<code>term.mailerd+smail</code> by Byron A. Jeff and the <code>BCRMailHandlerXXX</code> by Bill C. Riemers.</p>
<p>That being said, we will give a thumbnail description of how mail works.
There are two parts to getting mail running, sending messages and
receiving messages. We will begin with sending messages from your local
box to the network.</p>
<p>There are two classes of mail programs. The first is the mail user
agent (MUA). MUA's help you read, compose and send messages. Examples
of MUA's are <code>elm</code>, <code>pine</code>, <code>Mail</code> and
<code>vm</code>.  MUA's do not really do any networking; they just put the
messages together - the real work of sending mail is done by the
second class of mail programs, the mail transfer agents (MTA's). These
are invoked by the MUA's. They take the message, decide where to send
it by looking at the address, and then actually deliver it over the
network.</p>
<p>The two most common MTA's on Linux systems are <code>sendmail</code> and
<code>smail</code>. The basic idea is to get your MTA to connect to
another MTA running on a machine on the net that will know what to do
with your message. This is done by redirecting a local port to the
smtp port on the net machine. You then have to tell you MTA to take
any message it does not know what to do with, and send it out over the
redirected port on your local machine to the MTA on the remote
machine, which will then route your message to its correct
destination.</p>
<p>How do we do this using smail?  We first redirect a port to
the smtp port on the network mail machine (<code>mailhost</code>):</p>
<p><code>tredir XXXX mailhost:25</code></p>
<p>here XXXX is the port number that the <code>smail</code> on the
localhost will connect to (note that I have to give this port a name
in my '/etc/services' to get smail to recognize
it). Smail has several configuration files that usually
live in '/usr/local/lib/smail'. The ones we care about are
'config', 'routers' and 'transports'. Note
that I am assuming you have already got smail configured
correctly for local mail - delivery to files and pipes and such things.
Again, consult the documentation if you have not.</p>
<p>In the file 'config', we put the following definition:</p>
<p>
<pre>
  smart_path=localhost
</pre>
 </p>
<p>localhost is the machine that smail connects to when
it does not know what to do with a message.</p>
<p>In 'routers' we put</p>
<p>
<pre>
 
  smart_host: 
  driver=smarthost, 
  transport=termsmtp; 
  path = localhost 
</pre>
</p>
<p>In 'transports' we put</p>
<p>
<pre>
  
  termsmtp:        driver=tcpsmtp, 
        inet,                    
        return_path, 
        remove_header="From", 
        append_header="From: YOUR_NET_ADDRESS", 
        -received, 
        -max_addrs, -max_chars; 
        service=YOUR_SMTP_SERVICE, 
</pre>
</p>
<p>In the above, the header lines change the <code>From</code> header in all
your outgoing mail to the address, <code>YOUR_NET_ADDRESS</code>, which is
the network address you want mail sent to. If more than one user is
going to be using your <code>TERM</code> link, you will have to do something
more fancy, like keep a database of local user's network addresses and
insert these in the <code>From:</code> headers.</p>
<p>The service line is the name of the local port number that you have
redirected to the smtp port on the network connected machine. In my
version of smail, I cannot just set this to a number, I have
to set it to a name, like ``foo'', and then define ``foo'' in my '/etc/services' to be the number of my redirected port. If you use
a SUID tredir and just redirect the smtp port (25), you
do not need to define this.</p>
<p>This should be enough to get you going. If you decide to use <code>sendmail</code>, the principles are the same but the details differ.
Ronald Florence (ron@mlfarm.com) told me that the stock Sun
sendmail will not send multiple queued messages over a
redirected port; BSD sendmail 8.6.9 works fine.  He made the following
changes to '/etc/sendmail.cf' to get it working with <code>TERM</code>. In his
case, the default sendmail port (25) is used for SMTP traffic over a
local ethernet so Internet mail is forwarded to a redirected TCP
port.</p>
<p>
<pre>
  #
  #Create the termsmtp mailer, which sends mail via a re-directed TCP port  
  #
  Mtermsmtp,P=[TCP], F=mDFMuCXe, S=22, R=22, A=TCP $h PORTNUMBER
</pre>
</p>
<p>Here, <code>PORTNUMBER</code> is the number of the redirected port on the
local machine. This should be an unused port over 2000. We next tell
sendmail which machine to connect to, and set termsmtp as the
default mailer.</p>
<p>
<pre>
  #
  # major relay mailer
  #
  DMtermsmtp
  #
  # major relay host: use the $M mailer to send mail to other domains
  #
  DR HOSTNAME
  CR HOSTNAME
</pre>
</p>
<p>Here <code>HOSTNAME</code> is the name of your local host (does
<code>localhost</code> work?). The last entry goes under Rule 0 to forward
Internet mail.</p>
<p>
<pre>
  # Pass other valid names up the ladder to our forwarder
  R$*&lt;@$*.$+&gt;$*         $#$M    $@$R $:$1&lt;@$2.$3&gt;$4     user@any.domain
</pre>
</p>
<p>When the <code>TERM</code> connection is established to the Internet host, run the
following commands on the local machine.</p>
<p>
<pre>
  tredir PORTNUMBER internet.host:25
  /usr/lib/sendmail -q
</pre>
</p>
<p>We now turn to receiving electronic mail using <code>TERM</code>. We will
assume that mail is sent to your account on the network machine <code>mailhost</code>. The simplest solution is to just use trsh or
termtelnet to log on to <code>mailhost</code> and read your mail
on there. However, it is also possible to have your mail
automatically downloaded to your local machine. One way to do this is
to use the Post Office Protocol, (POP). POP was designed for exactly
this purpose: to deliver mail to machines that have intermittent
network connections. To use POP, you must have a POP server installed
on <code>mailhost</code>. Assuming that you do, you can then use a POP
client to download your mail every few minutes. This is done, as you
might expect, using tredir. The POP service is 110 (<b>note</b> that there is an older protocol, POP-2, which uses port 109;
in this document we describe POP-3, which is the latest version of
POP). There are several POP clients available. One, written in the
script language <code>perl</code> is pop-perl-1.X, written by William
Perry and maintained by myself - it can be found on sunsite.unc.edu:pub/Linux/system/Mail.</p>
<p>To use POP, you redirect a local port to port 110 on <code>mailhost</code> and configure your client to retrieve your mail from localhost
using the local port. As an example, we will assume that there is a POP
server running on <code>mailhost</code>. We will redirect the local port
2110, and fire up the pop-perl client:</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ tredir 2110 mailhost:110
  Redirecting 2110 to mailhost:110
  $ pop 
  Username: bill 
  Password: &lt;enter your password for mailhost&gt;
  Pop Host: name of local 
  Pop Port: 2110 
  Starting popmail daemon for bill 
</pre>
</p>
<p>If you do not have a POP server available, the BCRMailHandler package
has a program to download your mail over a <code>TERM</code> link to
your local machine. I have not used it, but anyone who has is welcome
to comment. You can also use the term.mailerd+smail package for this purpose. 
Alas, both BCRMailHandler and the term.mailerd.smail package do not work anymore with <code>TERM</code> versions 2.0.0 and higher.</p>
