<p> 
<code>TERM</code> allows users to open up X windows on the local machine
from clients that are running on a machine on the network. This is
done by using the <code>txconn</code> client. txconn is
executed on the remote, network-connected machine; it is invoked
simply as txconn. It goes into the background and returns a
number on the standard output; this number is the display number that
clients should use to access the X server on the local machine. An
example should make this clear.  I am logged in, via trsh,
to my remote <code>TERM</code> host, named <code>foo.</code> On foo, I do the following </p>
<p>
<pre>
  foo$ txconn 
  Xconn bound to screen 10 
  :10 
  foo$
</pre>
</p>
<p>Now, on any host that I wish to run an X client on, that is to display on
my local machine's X server, I do</p>
<p>
<pre>
  setenv DISPLAY foo:10
</pre>
</p>
<p>(for <code>bash</code> you should use <code>export DISPLAY=foo:10</code>). In some cases it can furthermore be necessary to do a </p>
<p>
<pre>
  xhost + foo
</pre>

or even a </p>
<p>
<pre>
  xhost +
</pre>
</p>
<p>on your local machine. Now when I start the client, it will try to connect to
screen 10 on machine foo, but txconn is listening to
this screen, and will forward all X protocol packets via <code>TERM</code>
to the X server on the local host - <i>i.e.</i> the window will open
up on your local machine.</p>
<p>It is possible to go the other way - run a client on your local
machine and have it open up a window on a remote machine on the
network; however we will defer explaining this until after we have
discussed tredir.</p>
<p>The X protocol is not very efficient; it wastes some bandwidth. This
is usually not a problem over an ethernet, but can be murder over a
modem. X11R6 is supposed to introduce a low bandwidth version of the X
protocol, LBX. If however you are using X11R5 you can use a utility named sxpc which compresses the X protocol, improving response over
serial lines. Sxpc includes a write-up on how to get it
working with <code>TERM</code>, and is recommended. The sxpc package also explains how to use xauth; so it is
doubly recommended.</p>
