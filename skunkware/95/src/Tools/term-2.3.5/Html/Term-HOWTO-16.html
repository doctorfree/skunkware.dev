<p>In the Linux related newsgroups many questions about <code>TERM</code> are coming back every couple of weeks, together with the answers to these questions. To reduce traffic to the newsgroup, in this section I shall try to make a composition of these questions and the answers to them. Some of the answers have been checked by me as I also had related problems. Others, I have just taken from the newsgroups without testing them.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Many people, especially those who are using Ultrix, seem to have trouble with <code>vi</code> presenting less than 24 lines on a window with 24 lines. There are three ways to get rid of this problem:

<ol>
<li>Log in into the remote system using: 
<pre>
  trsh -s telnet &lt;hostname&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Put 'resize; clear' in your '.login' file</li>
<li>The best solutions seems to be to enter the following remote:
<pre>
  stty 38400
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Many people seem to have problems with crashing <code>TERM</code> connections, whatever may be the reason of the crashes. So before starting applications people want to know whether their <code>TERM</code> connection is still alive or not. This can be checked using the following small shell script examples:

When you are using tcsh:

<pre>
  if ( { trsh -s true } ) then
    ...
  endif
</pre>


When you are using bash:

<pre>
  if trsh -s true; then
    ...
  fi
</pre>
</li>
<li>The new WWW browser called <code>Netscape</code> is causing people problems to get it to work with <code>TERM</code>. The good news is that it will work under <code>TERM</code>. Here is how:

<pre>
        1. Termify netscape
        2. Fire up termnetscape
              under Options | Preferences | Mail/Proxys
              leave _all_ of the proxy boxes blank
              set the SOCKS box to 'remotehost' & 80
        3. Ignore the error you get when you exit the Options menu.
        4. If termnetscape fails to work right:
              under Options | Preferences | Mail/Proxys
              leave _all_ of the proxy boxes blank
              set the SOCKS box to 'none' & 80
        5. Ignore the error you get when you exit the Options menu.
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
