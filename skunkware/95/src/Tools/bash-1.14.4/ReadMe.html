     <STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>
          <STRONG>bash</STRONG> [options] [file]

     <STRONG>COPYRIGHT</STRONG>
          Bash is Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 by the Free Software
          Foundation, Inc.

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          <STRONG>Bash</STRONG> is an <STRONG>sh</STRONG>-compatible command language interpreter that
          executes commands read from the standard input or from a
          file.  <STRONG>Bash</STRONG> also incorporates useful features from the <EM>Korn</EM>
          and <STRONG>C</STRONG> shells (<STRONG>ksh</STRONG> and <STRONG>csh</STRONG>).

          <STRONG>Bash</STRONG> is ultimately intended to be a conformant
          implementation of the IEEE Posix Shell and Tools
          specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2).

     <STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
          In addition to the single-character shell options documented
          in the description of the <STRONG>set</STRONG> builtin command, <STRONG>bash</STRONG>
          interprets the following flags when it is invoked:

          <STRONG>-c</STRONG> <EM>string</EM> If the <STRONG>-c</STRONG> flag is present, then commands are read
                    from <EM>string</EM>.  If there are arguments after the
                    <EM>string</EM>, they are assigned to the positional
                    parameters, starting with <STRONG>$0</STRONG>.
          <STRONG>-i</STRONG>        If the <STRONG>-i</STRONG> flag is present, the shell is
                    <EM>interactive</EM>.
          <STRONG>-s</STRONG>        If the <STRONG>-s</STRONG> flag is present, or if no arguments
                    remain after option processing, then commands are
                    read from the standard input.  This option allows
                    the positional parameters to be set when invoking
                    an interactive shell.
          <STRONG>-</STRONG>         A single <STRONG>-</STRONG> signals the end of options and disables
                    further option processing.  Any arguments after
                    the <STRONG>-</STRONG> are treated as filenames and arguments.  An
                    argument of <STRONG>--</STRONG> is equivalent to an argument of <STRONG>-</STRONG>.

          <STRONG>Bash</STRONG> also interprets a number of multi-character options.
          These options must appear on the command line before the
          single-character options to be recognized.

          <STRONG>-norc</STRONG>     Do not read and execute the personal
                    initialization file ~/.<EM>bashrc</EM> if the shell is
                    interactive.  This option is on by default if the
                    shell is invoked as <STRONG>sh</STRONG>.
          <STRONG>-noprofile</STRONG>
                    Do not read either the system-wide startup file
                    /<EM>etc</EM>/<EM>profile</EM> or any of the personal initialization
                    files ~/.<EM>bash_profile</EM>, ~/.<EM>bash_login</EM>, or
                    ~/.<EM>profile</EM>.  By default, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> normally reads these
                    files when it is invoked as a login shell (see
                    <STRONG>INVOCATION</STRONG> below).
          <STRONG>-rcfile</STRONG> <EM>file</EM>
                    Execute commands from <EM>file</EM> instead of the standard
                    personal initialization file ~/.<EM>bashrc</EM>, if the
                    shell is interactive (see <STRONG>INVOCATION</STRONG> below).
          <STRONG>-version</STRONG>  Show the version number of this instance of <STRONG>bash</STRONG>
                    when starting.
          <STRONG>-quiet</STRONG>    Do not be verbose when starting up (do not show
                    the shell version or any other information).  This
                    is the default.
          <STRONG>-login</STRONG>    Make <STRONG>bash</STRONG> act as if it had been invoked as a login
                    shell.
          <STRONG>-nobraceexpansion</STRONG>
                    Do not perform curly brace expansion (see <STRONG>Brace</STRONG>
                    <STRONG>Expansion</STRONG> below).
          <STRONG>-nolineediting</STRONG>
                    Do not use the GNU <EM>readline</EM> library to read
                    command lines if interactive.
          <STRONG>-posix</STRONG>    Change the behavior of bash where the default
                    operation differs from the Posix 1003.2 standard
                    to match the standard

     <STRONG>ARGUMENTS</STRONG>
          If arguments remain after option processing, and neither the
          <STRONG>-c</STRONG> nor the <STRONG>-s</STRONG> option has been supplied, the first argument
          is assumed to be the name of a file containing shell
          commands.  If <STRONG>bash</STRONG> is invoked in this fashion, <STRONG>$0</STRONG> is set to
          the name of the file, and the positional parameters are set
          to the remaining arguments.  <STRONG>Bash</STRONG> reads and executes
          commands from this file, then exits.  <STRONG>Bash's</STRONG> exit status is
          the exit status of the last command executed in the script.

     <STRONG>DEFINITIONS</STRONG>
          <STRONG>blank</STRONG>
               A space or tab.
          <STRONG>word</STRONG> A sequence of characters considered as a single unit by
               the shell.  Also known as a <STRONG>token</STRONG>.
          <STRONG>name</STRONG> A <EM>word</EM> consisting only of alphanumeric characters and
               underscores, and beginning with an alphabetic character
               or an underscore.  Also referred to as an <STRONG>identifier</STRONG>.
          <STRONG>metacharacter</STRONG>
               A character that, when unquoted, separates words.  One
               of the following:
               <STRONG>|</STRONG>  <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG> <STRONG>;</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG> <STRONG>)</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;</STRONG> <STRONG>&gt;</STRONG> <STRONG>space</STRONG> <STRONG>tab</STRONG>
          <STRONG>control</STRONG> <STRONG>operator</STRONG>
               A <EM>token</EM> that performs a control function.  It is one of
               the following symbols:
               <STRONG>||</STRONG> <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG> <STRONG>&amp;&amp;</STRONG> <STRONG>;</STRONG> <STRONG>;;</STRONG> <STRONG>(</STRONG> <STRONG>)</STRONG> <STRONG>|</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;newline&gt;</STRONG>

     <STRONG>RESERVED</STRONG> <STRONG>WORDS</STRONG>
          <EM>Reserved</EM> <EM>words</EM> are words that have a special meaning to the
          shell.  The following words are recognized as reserved when
          unquoted and either the first word of a simple command (see
          <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG> <STRONG>GRAMMAR</STRONG> below) or the third word of a <STRONG>case</STRONG> or <STRONG>for</STRONG>
          command:

          <STRONG>!</STRONG> <STRONG>case</STRONG>  <STRONG>do</STRONG> <STRONG>done</STRONG> <STRONG>elif</STRONG> <STRONG>else</STRONG> <STRONG>esac</STRONG> <STRONG>fi</STRONG> <STRONG>for</STRONG> <STRONG>function</STRONG> <STRONG>if</STRONG> <STRONG>in</STRONG> <STRONG>select</STRONG>
          <STRONG>then</STRONG> <STRONG>until</STRONG> <STRONG>while</STRONG> <STRONG>{</STRONG> <STRONG>}</STRONG>

     <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG> <STRONG>GRAMMAR</STRONG>
        <STRONG>Simple</STRONG> <STRONG>Commands</STRONG>
          A <EM>simple</EM> <EM>command</EM> is a sequence of optional variable
          assignments followed by <EM>blank</EM>-separated words and
          redirections, and terminated by a <EM>control</EM> <EM>operator</EM>.  The
          first word specifies the command to be executed.  The
          remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked
          command.

          The return value of a <EM>simple</EM> <EM>command</EM> is its exit status, or
          128+<STRONG>n</STRONG> if the command is terminated by signal <STRONG>n</STRONG>.

        <STRONG>Pipelines</STRONG>
          A <EM>pipeline</EM> is a sequence of one or more commands separated
          by the character <STRONG>|</STRONG>.  The format for a pipeline is:

               [ ! ] <EM>command</EM> [ <STRONG>|</STRONG> <EM>command2</EM> ... ]

          The standard output of <EM>command</EM> is connected to the standard
          input of <EM>command2</EM>.  This connection is performed before any
          redirections specified by the command (see <STRONG>REDIRECTION</STRONG>
          below).

          If the reserved word <STRONG>!</STRONG> precedes a pipeline, the exit status
          of that pipeline is the logical NOT of the exit status of
          the last command.  Otherwise, the status of the pipeline is
          the exit status of the last command.  The shell waits for
          all commands in the pipeline to terminate before returning a
          value.

          Each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process
          (i.e., in a subshell).

        <STRONG>Lists</STRONG>
          A <EM>list</EM> is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by
          one of the operators <STRONG>;</STRONG>, <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>, <STRONG>&amp;&amp;</STRONG>, or <STRONG>||</STRONG>, and terminated by one
          of <STRONG>;</STRONG>, <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>, or <STRONG>&lt;newline&gt;</STRONG>.

          Of these list operators, <STRONG>&amp;&amp;</STRONG> and <STRONG>||</STRONG> have equal precedence,
          followed by <STRONG>;</STRONG> and <STRONG>&amp;,</STRONG> which have equal precedence.

          If a command is terminated by the control operator <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>, the
          shell executes the command in the <EM>background</EM> in a subshell.
          The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the
          return status is 0.  Commands separated by a <STRONG>;</STRONG> are executed
          sequentially; the shell waits for each command to terminate
          in turn.  The return status is the exit status of the last
          command executed.

          The control operators <STRONG>&amp;&amp;</STRONG> and <STRONG>||</STRONG> denote AND lists and OR
          lists, respectively.  An AND list has the form

               <EM>command</EM> <STRONG>&amp;&amp;</STRONG> <EM>command2</EM>

          <EM>command2</EM> is executed if, and only if, <EM>command</EM> returns an
          exit status of zero.

          An OR list has the form

               <EM>command</EM> <STRONG>||</STRONG> <EM>command2</EM>

          <EM>command2</EM> is executed if and only if <EM>command</EM> returns a
          non-zero exit status.  The return status of AND and OR lists
          is the exit status of the last command executed in the list.

        <STRONG>Compound</STRONG> <STRONG>Commands</STRONG>
          A <EM>compound</EM> <EM>command</EM> is one of the following:

          (<EM>list)</EM>
               <EM>list</EM> is executed in a subshell.  Variable assignments
               and builtin commands that affect the shell's
               environment do not remain in effect after the command
               completes.  The return status is the exit status of
               <EM>list</EM>.

          { <EM>list</EM>; }
               <EM>list</EM> is simply executed in the current shell
               environment.  This is known as a <EM>group</EM> <EM>command</EM>.  The
               return status is the exit status of <EM>list</EM>.

          <STRONG>for</STRONG> <EM>name</EM> [ <STRONG>in</STRONG> <EM>word</EM>; ] <STRONG>do</STRONG> <EM>list</EM> ; <STRONG>done</STRONG>
               The list of words following <STRONG>in</STRONG> is expanded, generating
               a list of items.  The variable <EM>name</EM> is set to each
               element of this list in turn, and <EM>list</EM> is executed each
               time.  If the <STRONG>in</STRONG> <EM>word</EM> is omitted, the <STRONG>for</STRONG> command
               executes <EM>list</EM> once for each positional parameter that
               is set (see <STRONG>PARAMETERS</STRONG> below).

          <STRONG>select</STRONG> <EM>name</EM> [ <STRONG>in</STRONG> <EM>word</EM>; ] <STRONG>do</STRONG> <EM>list</EM> ; <STRONG>done</STRONG>
               The list of words following <STRONG>in</STRONG> is expanded, generating
               a list of items.  The set of expanded words is printed
               on the standard error, each preceded by a number.  If
               the <STRONG>in</STRONG> <EM>word</EM> is omitted, the positional parameters are
               printed (see <STRONG>PARAMETERS</STRONG> below).  The <STRONG>PS3</STRONG> prompt is then
               displayed and a line read from the standard input.  If
               the line consists of the number corresponding to one of
               the displayed words, then the value of <EM>name</EM> is set to
               that word.  If the line is empty, the words and prompt
               are displayed again.  If EOF is read, the command
               completes.  Any other value read causes <EM>name</EM> to be set
               to null.  The line read is saved in the variable <STRONG>REPLY</STRONG>.
               The <EM>list</EM> is executed after each selection until a <STRONG>break</STRONG>
               or <STRONG>return</STRONG> command is executed.  The exit status of
               <STRONG>select</STRONG> is the exit status of the last command executed
               in <EM>list</EM>, or zero if no commands were executed.

          <STRONG>case</STRONG> <EM>word</EM> <STRONG>in</STRONG> [ <EM>pattern</EM> [ <STRONG>|</STRONG> <EM>pattern</EM> ] ... ) <EM>list</EM> ;; ] ... <STRONG>esac</STRONG>
               A <STRONG>case</STRONG> command first expands <EM>word</EM>, and tries to match
               it against each <EM>pattern</EM> in turn, using the same
               matching rules as for pathname expansion (see <STRONG>Pathname</STRONG>
               <STRONG>Expansion</STRONG> below).  When a match is found, the
               corresponding <EM>list</EM> is executed.  After the first match,
               no subsequent matches are attempted.  The exit status
               is zero if no patterns are matches.  Otherwise, it is
               the exit status of the last command executed in <EM>list</EM>.

          <STRONG>if</STRONG> <EM>list</EM> <STRONG>then</STRONG> <EM>list</EM> [ <STRONG>elif</STRONG> <EM>list</EM> <STRONG>then</STRONG> <EM>list</EM> ] ... [ <STRONG>else</STRONG> <EM>list</EM> ] <STRONG>fi</STRONG>
               The <STRONG>if</STRONG> <EM>list</EM> is executed.  If its exit status is zero,
               the <STRONG>then</STRONG> <EM>list</EM> is executed.  Otherwise, each <STRONG>elif</STRONG> <EM>list</EM>
               is executed in turn, and if its exit status is zero,
               the corresponding <STRONG>then</STRONG> <EM>list</EM> is executed and the command
               completes.  Otherwise, the <STRONG>else</STRONG> <EM>list</EM> is executed, if
               present.  The exit status is the exit status of the
               last command executed, or zero if no condition tested
               true.

          <STRONG>while</STRONG> <EM>list</EM> <STRONG>do</STRONG> <EM>list</EM> <STRONG>done</STRONG>
          <STRONG>until</STRONG> <EM>list</EM> <STRONG>do</STRONG> <EM>list</EM> <STRONG>done</STRONG>
               The <STRONG>while</STRONG> command continuously executes the <STRONG>do</STRONG> <EM>list</EM> as
               long as the last command in <EM>list</EM> returns an exit status
               of zero.  The <STRONG>until</STRONG> command is identical to the <STRONG>while</STRONG>
               command, except that the test is negated; the <STRONG>do</STRONG> <EM>list</EM>
               is executed as long as the last command in <EM>list</EM> returns
               a non-zero exit status.  The exit status of the <STRONG>while</STRONG>
               and <STRONG>until</STRONG> commands is the exit status of the last <STRONG>do</STRONG>
               <EM>list</EM> command executed, or zero if none was executed.

          [ <STRONG>function</STRONG> ] <EM>name</EM> () { <EM>list</EM>; }
               This defines a function named <EM>name</EM>.  The <EM>body</EM> of the
               function is the <EM>list</EM> of commands between { and }.  This
               list is executed whenever <EM>name</EM> is specified as the name
               of a simple command.  The exit status of a function is
               the exit status of the last command executed in the
               body.  (See <STRONG>FUNCTIONS</STRONG> below.)

     <STRONG>COMMENTS</STRONG>
          In a non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which
          the <STRONG>-o</STRONG> <STRONG>interactive-comments</STRONG> option to the <STRONG>set</STRONG> builtin is
          enabled, a word beginning with <STRONG>#</STRONG> causes that word and all
          remaining characters on that line to be ignored.  An
          interactive shell without the <STRONG>-o</STRONG> <STRONG>interactive-comments</STRONG> option
          enabled does not allow comments.

     <STRONG>QUOTING</STRONG>
          <EM>Quoting</EM> is used to remove the special meaning of certain
          characters or words to the shell.  Quoting can be used to
          disable special treatment for special characters, to prevent
          reserved words from being recognized as such, and to prevent
          parameter expansion.

          Each of the <EM>metacharacters</EM> listed above under <STRONG>DEFINITIONS</STRONG>
          has special meaning to the shell and must be quoted if they
          are to represent themselves.  There are three quoting
          mechanisms: the <EM>escape</EM> <EM>character</EM>, single quotes, and double
          quotes.

          A non-quoted backslash (<STRONG>\</STRONG>) is the <EM>escape</EM> <EM>character</EM>.  It
          preserves the literal value of the next character that
          follows, with the exception of &lt;newline&gt;.  If a <STRONG>\</STRONG>&lt;newline&gt;
          pair appears, and the backslash is not quoted, the
          <STRONG>\</STRONG>&lt;newline&gt; is treated as a line continuation (that is, it is
          effectively ignored).

          Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal
          value of each character within the quotes.  A single quote
          may not occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a
          backslash.

          Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal
          value of all characters within the quotes, with the
          exception of <STRONG>$</STRONG>, <STRONG>`</STRONG>, and <STRONG>\</STRONG>.  The characters <STRONG>$</STRONG> and <STRONG>`</STRONG> retain
          their special meaning within double quotes.  The backslash
          retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the
          following characters: <STRONG>$</STRONG>, <STRONG>`</STRONG>, <STRONG>"</STRONG>, <STRONG>\</STRONG>, or <STRONG>&lt;newline&gt;</STRONG>.  A double
          quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it
          with a backslash.

          The special parameters <STRONG>*</STRONG> and <STRONG>@</STRONG> have special meaning when in
          double quotes (see <STRONG>PARAMETERS</STRONG> below).

     <STRONG>PARAMETERS</STRONG>
          A <EM>parameter</EM> is an entity that stores values, somewhat like a
          variable in a conventional programming language.  It can be
          a <EM>name</EM>, a number, or one of the special characters listed
          below under <STRONG>Special</STRONG> <STRONG>Parameters</STRONG>.  For the shell's purposes, a
          <EM>variable</EM> is a parameter denoted by a <EM>name</EM>.

          A parameter is set if it has been assigned a value.  The
          null string is a valid value.  Once a variable is set, it
          may be unset only by using the <STRONG>unset</STRONG> builtin command (see
          <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG> <STRONG>BUILTIN</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG> below).

          A <EM>variable</EM> may be assigned to by a statement of the form

               <EM>name</EM>=[<EM>value</EM>]

          If <EM>value</EM> is not given, the variable is assigned the null
          string.  All <EM>values</EM> undergo tilde expansion, parameter and
          variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic
          expansion, and quote removal.  If the variable has its <STRONG>-i</STRONG>
          attribute set (see <STRONG>declare</STRONG> below in <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG> <STRONG>BUILTIN</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG>)
          then <EM>value</EM> is subject to arithmetic expansion even if the
          $[...] syntax does not appear.  Word splitting is not
          performed, with the exception of <STRONG>"$@"</STRONG> as explained below
          under <STRONG>Special</STRONG> <STRONG>Parameters</STRONG>.  Pathname expansion is not
          performed.

        <STRONG>Positional</STRONG> <STRONG>Parameters</STRONG>
          A <EM>positional</EM> <EM>parameter</EM> is a parameter denoted by one or more
          digits, other than the single digit 0.  Positional
          parameters are assigned from the shell's arguments when it
          is invoked, and may be reassigned using the <STRONG>set</STRONG> builtin
          command.  Positional parameters may not be assigned to with
          assignment statements.  The positional parameters are
          temporarily replaced when a shell function is executed (see
          <STRONG>FUNCTIONS</STRONG> below).

          When a positional parameter consisting of more than a single
          digit is expanded, it must be enclosed in braces (see
          <STRONG>EXPANSION</STRONG> below).

        <STRONG>Special</STRONG> <STRONG>Parameters</STRONG>
          The shell treats several parameters specially.  These
          parameters may only be referenced; assignment to them is not
          allowed.
          <STRONG>*</STRONG>    Expands to the positional parameters, starting from
               one.  When the expansion occurs within double quotes,
               it expands to a single word with the value of each
               parameter separated by the first character of the <STRONG>IFS</STRONG>
               special variable.  That is, ``<STRONG>$*</STRONG>'' is equivalent to
               ``<STRONG>$1c$2c...</STRONG>'', where <STRONG>c</STRONG> is the first character of the
               value of the <STRONG>IFS</STRONG> variable.  If <STRONG>IFS</STRONG> is null or unset,
               the parameters are separated by spaces.
          <STRONG>@</STRONG>    Expands to the positional parameters, starting from
               one.  When the expansion occurs within double quotes,
               each parameter expands as a separate word.  That is, ``
               <STRONG>$@</STRONG>'' is equivalent to ``<STRONG>$1</STRONG>'' ``<STRONG>$2</STRONG>'' ...  When there are
               no positional parameters, ``<STRONG>$@</STRONG>'' and <STRONG>$@</STRONG> expand to
               nothing (i.e., they are removed).
          <STRONG>#</STRONG>    Expands to the number of positional parameters in
               decimal.
          <STRONG>?</STRONG>    Expands to the status of the most recently executed
               foreground pipeline.
          <STRONG>-</STRONG>    Expands to the current option flags as specified upon
               invocation, by the <STRONG>set</STRONG> builtin command, or those set by
               the shell itself (such as the <STRONG>-i</STRONG> flag).
          <STRONG>$</STRONG>    Expands to the process ID of the shell.  In a ()
               subshell, it expands to the process ID of the current
               shell, not the subshell.
          <STRONG>!</STRONG>    Expands to the process ID of the most recently executed
               background (asynchronous) command.
          <STRONG>0</STRONG>    Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.  This
               is set at shell initialization.  If <STRONG>bash</STRONG> is invoked
               with a file of commands, <STRONG>$0</STRONG> is set to the name of that
               file.  If <STRONG>bash</STRONG> is started with the <STRONG>-c</STRONG> option, then <STRONG>$0</STRONG>
               is set to the first argument after the string to be
               executed, if one is present.  Otherwise, it is set to
               the pathname used to invoke <STRONG>bash</STRONG>, as given by argument
               zero.
          <STRONG>_</STRONG>    Expands to the last argument to the previous command,
               after expansion.  Also set to the full pathname of each
               command executed and placed in the environment exported
               to that command.

        <STRONG>Shell</STRONG> <STRONG>Variables</STRONG>
          The following variables are set by the shell:

          <STRONG>PPID</STRONG> The process ID of the shell's parent.
          <STRONG>PWD</STRONG>  The current working directory as set by the <STRONG>cd</STRONG> command.
          <STRONG>OLDPWD</STRONG>
               The previous working directory as set by the <STRONG>cd</STRONG>
               command.
          <STRONG>REPLY</STRONG>
               Set to the line of input read by the <STRONG>read</STRONG> builtin
               command when no arguments are supplied.
          <STRONG>UID</STRONG>  Expands to the user ID of the current user, initialized
               at shell startup.
          <STRONG>EUID</STRONG> Expands to the effective user ID of the current user,
               initialized at shell startup.
          <STRONG>BASH</STRONG> Expands to the full pathname used to invoke this
               instance of <STRONG>bash</STRONG>.
          <STRONG>BASH_VERSION</STRONG>
               Expands to the version number of this instance of <STRONG>bash</STRONG>.
          <STRONG>SHLVL</STRONG>
               Incremented by one each time an instance of <STRONG>bash</STRONG> is
               started.
          <STRONG>RANDOM</STRONG>
               Each time this parameter is referenced, a random
               integer is generated.  The sequence of random numbers
               may be initialized by assigning a value to <STRONG>RANDOM</STRONG>.  If
               <STRONG>RANDOM</STRONG> is unset, it loses its special properties, even
               if it is subsequently reset.

          <STRONG>SECONDS</STRONG>
               Each time this parameter is referenced, the number of
               seconds since shell invocation is returned.  If a value
               is assigned to <STRONG>SECONDS</STRONG>, the value returned upon
               subsequent references is the number of seconds since
               the assignment plus the value assigned.  If <STRONG>SECONDS</STRONG> is
               unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is
               subsequently reset.
          <STRONG>LINENO</STRONG>
               Each time this parameter is referenced, the shell
               substitutes a decimal number representing the current
               sequential line number (starting with 1) within a
               script or function.  When not in a script or function,
               the value substituted is not guaranteed to be
               meaningful.  When in a function, the value is not the
               number of the source line that the command appears on
               (that information has been lost by the time the
               function is executed), but is an approximation of the
               number of <EM>simple</EM> <EM>commands</EM> executed in the current
               function.  If <STRONG>LINENO</STRONG> is unset, it loses its special
               properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
          <STRONG>HISTCMD</STRONG>
               The history number, or index in the history list, of
               the current command.  If <STRONG>HISTCMD</STRONG> is unset, it loses its
               special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
          <STRONG>OPTARG</STRONG>
               The value of the last option argument processed by the
               <STRONG>getopts</STRONG> builtin command (see <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG> <STRONG>BUILTIN</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG>
               below).
          <STRONG>OPTIND</STRONG>
               The index of the next argument to be processed by the
               <STRONG>getopts</STRONG> builtin command (see <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG> <STRONG>BUILTIN</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG>
               below).
          <STRONG>HOSTTYPE</STRONG>
               Automatically set to a string that uniquely describes
               the type of machine on which <STRONG>bash</STRONG> is executing.  The
               default is system-dependent.
          <STRONG>OSTYPE</STRONG>
               Automatically set to a string that describes the
               operating system on which <STRONG>bash</STRONG> is executing.  The
               default is system-dependent.

          The following variables are used by the shell.  In some
          cases, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> assigns a default value to a variable; these
          cases are noted below.

          <STRONG>IFS</STRONG>  The <EM>Internal</EM> <EM>Field</EM> <EM>Separator</EM> that is used for word
               splitting after expansion and to split lines into words
               with the <STRONG>read</STRONG> builtin command.  The default value is
               ``&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;''.
          <STRONG>PATH</STRONG> The search path for commands.  It is a colon-separated
               list of directories in which the shell looks for
               commands (see <STRONG>COMMAND</STRONG> <STRONG>EXECUTION</STRONG> below).  The default
               path is system-dependent, and is set by the
               administrator who installs <STRONG>bash</STRONG>.  A common value is
               ``/usr/gnu/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin:.''.
          <STRONG>HOME</STRONG> The home directory of the current user; the default
               argument for the <STRONG>cd</STRONG> builtin command.
          <STRONG>CDPATH</STRONG>
               The search path for the <STRONG>cd</STRONG> command.  This is a colon-
               separated list of directories in which the shell looks
               for destination directories specified by the <STRONG>cd</STRONG>
               command.  A sample value is ``.:~:/usr''.
          <STRONG>ENV</STRONG>  If this parameter is set when <STRONG>bash</STRONG> is executing a shell
               script, its value is interpreted as a filename
               containing commands to initialize the shell, as in
               .<EM>bashrc</EM>.  The value of <STRONG>ENV</STRONG> is subjected to parameter
               expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic
               expansion before being interpreted as a pathname.  <STRONG>PATH</STRONG>
               is not used to search for the resultant pathname.
          <STRONG>MAIL</STRONG> If this parameter is set to a filename and the <STRONG>MAILPATH</STRONG>
               variable is not set, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> informs the user of the
               arrival of mail in the specified file.
          <STRONG>MAILCHECK</STRONG>
               Specifies how often (in seconds) <STRONG>bash</STRONG> checks for mail.
               The default is 60 seconds.  When it is time to check
               for mail, the shell does so before prompting.  If this
               variable is unset, the shell disables mail checking.
          <STRONG>MAILPATH</STRONG>
               A colon-separated list of pathnames to be checked for
               mail. The message to be printed may be specified by
               separating the pathname from the message with a `?'.
               $_ stands for the name of the current mailfile.
               Example:
               <STRONG>MAILPATH</STRONG>='/usr/spool/mail/bfox?"You have
               mail":~/shell-mail?"$_ has mail!"'
               <STRONG>Bash</STRONG> supplies a default value for this variable, but
               the location of the user mail files that it uses is
               system dependent (e.g., /usr/spool/mail/<STRONG>$USER</STRONG>).
          <STRONG>MAIL_WARNING</STRONG>
               If set, and a file that <STRONG>bash</STRONG> is checking for mail has
               been accessed since the last time it was checked, the
               message ``The mail in <EM>mailfile</EM> has been read'' is
               printed.
          <STRONG>PS1</STRONG>  The value of this parameter is expanded (see <STRONG>PROMPTING</STRONG>
               below) and used as the primary prompt string.  The
               default value is ``<STRONG>bash\$</STRONG> ''.
          <STRONG>PS2</STRONG>  The value of this parameter is expanded and used as the
               secondary prompt string.  The default is ``<STRONG>&gt;</STRONG> ''.
          <STRONG>PS3</STRONG>  The value of this parameter is used as the prompt for
               the <EM>select</EM> command (see <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG> <STRONG>GRAMMAR</STRONG> above).
          <STRONG>PS4</STRONG>  The value of this parameter is expanded and the value
               is printed before each command <STRONG>bash</STRONG> displays during an
               execution trace.  The first character of <STRONG>PS4</STRONG> is
               replicated multiple times, as necessary, to indicate
               multiple levels of indirection.  The default is ``<STRONG>+</STRONG> ''.
          <STRONG>HISTSIZE</STRONG>
               The number of commands to remember in the command
               history (see <STRONG>HISTORY</STRONG> below).  The default value is 500.
          <STRONG>HISTFILE</STRONG>
               The name of the file in which command history is saved.
               (See <STRONG>HISTORY</STRONG> below.)  The default value is
               ~/.<EM>bash_history</EM>.  If unset, the command history is not
               saved when an interactive shell exits.
          <STRONG>HISTFILESIZE</STRONG>
               The maximum number of lines contained in the history
               file.  When this variable is assigned a value, the
               history file is truncated, if necessary, to contain no
               more than that number of lines.  The default value is
               500.
          <STRONG>OPTERR</STRONG>
               If set to the value 1, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> displays error messages
               generated by the <STRONG>getopts</STRONG> builtin command (see <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG>
               <STRONG>BUILTIN</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG> below).  <STRONG>OPTERR</STRONG> is initialized to 1
               each time the shell is invoked or a shell script is
               executed.
          <STRONG>PROMPT_COMMAND</STRONG>
               If set, the value is executed as a command prior to
               issuing each primary prompt.
          <STRONG>IGNOREEOF</STRONG>
               Controls the action of the shell on receipt of an <STRONG>EOF</STRONG>
               character as the sole input.  If set, the value is the
               number of consecutive <STRONG>EOF</STRONG> characters typed as the first
               characters on an input line before <STRONG>bash</STRONG> exits.  If the
               variable exists but does not have a numeric value, or
               has no value, the default value is 10.  If it does not
               exist, <STRONG>EOF</STRONG> signifies the end of input to the shell.
               This is only in effect for interactive shells.
          <STRONG>TMOUT</STRONG>
               If set to a value greater than zero, the value is
               interpreted as the number of seconds to wait for input
               after issuing the primary prompt.  <STRONG>Bash</STRONG> terminates
               after waiting for that number of seconds if input does
               not arrive.
          <STRONG>FCEDIT</STRONG>
               The default editor for the <STRONG>fc</STRONG> builtin command.
          <STRONG>FIGNORE</STRONG>
               A colon-separated list of suffixes to ignore when
               performing filename completion (see <STRONG>READLINE</STRONG> below).  A
               filename whose suffix matches one of the entries in
               <STRONG>FIGNORE</STRONG> is excluded from the list of matched filenames.
               A sample value is ``.o:~''.
          <STRONG>INPUTRC</STRONG>
               The filename for the readline startup file, overriding
               the default of ~/.<EM>inputrc</EM> (see <STRONG>READLINE</STRONG> below).
          <STRONG>notify</STRONG>
               If set, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> reports terminated background jobs
               immediately, rather than waiting until before printing
               the next primary prompt (see also the <STRONG>-b</STRONG> option to the
               <STRONG>set</STRONG> builtin command).
          <STRONG>history_control</STRONG>
          <STRONG>HISTCONTROL</STRONG>
               If set to a value of <EM>ignorespace</EM>, lines which begin
               with a <STRONG>space</STRONG> character are not entered on the history
               list.  If set to a value of <EM>ignoredups</EM>, lines matching
               the last history line are not entered.  A value of
               <EM>ignoreboth</EM> combines the two options.  If unset, or if
               set to any other value than those above, all lines read
               by the parser are saved on the history list.

          <STRONG>command_oriented_history</STRONG>
               If set, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> attempts to save all lines of a
               multiple-line command in the same history entry.  This
               allows easy re-editing of multi-line commands.

          <STRONG>glob_dot_filenames</STRONG>
               If set, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> includes filenames beginning with a `.' in
               the results of pathname expansion.

          <STRONG>allow_null_glob_expansion</STRONG>
               If set, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> allows pathname patterns which match no
               files (see <STRONG>Pathname</STRONG> <STRONG>Expansion</STRONG> below) to expand to a
               null string, rather than themselves.

          <STRONG>histchars</STRONG>
               The two or three characters which control history
               expansion and tokenization (see <STRONG>HISTORY</STRONG> <STRONG>EXPANSION</STRONG>
               below).  The first character is the <EM>history</EM> <EM>expansion</EM>
               <EM>character</EM>, that is, the character which signals the
               start of a history expansion, normally `<STRONG>!</STRONG>'.  The second
               character is the <EM>quick</EM> <EM>substitution</EM> character, which is
               used as shorthand for re-running the previous command
               entered, substituting one string for another in the
               command.  The default is `<STRONG>^</STRONG>'.  The optional third
               character is the character which signifies that the
               remainder of the line is a comment, when found as the
               first character of a word, normally `<STRONG>#</STRONG>'.  The history
               comment character causes history substitution to be
               skipped for the remaining words on the line.  It does
               not necessarily cause the shell parser to treat the
               rest of the line as a comment.

          <STRONG>nolinks</STRONG>
               If set, the shell does not follow symbolic links when
               executing commands that change the current working
               directory.  It uses the physical directory structure
               instead.  By default, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> follows the logical chain of
               directories when performing commands which change the
               current directory, such as <STRONG>cd</STRONG>.  See also the
               description of the <STRONG>-P</STRONG> option to the <STRONG>set</STRONG> builtin ( <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG>
               <STRONG>BUILTIN</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG> below).
          <STRONG>hostname_completion_file</STRONG>
          <STRONG>HOSTFILE</STRONG>
               Contains the name of a file in the same format as
               /<EM>etc</EM>/<EM>hosts</EM> that should be read when the shell needs to
               complete a hostname.  The file may be changed
               interactively; the next time hostname completion is
               attempted <STRONG>bash</STRONG> adds the contents of the new file to the
               already existing database.

          <STRONG>noclobber</STRONG>
               If set, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> does not overwrite an existing file with
               the <STRONG>&gt;</STRONG>, <STRONG>&gt;&amp;</STRONG>, and <STRONG>&lt;&gt;</STRONG> redirection operators.  This variable
               may be overridden when creating output files by using
               the redirection operator <STRONG>&gt;|</STRONG> instead of <STRONG>&gt;</STRONG> (see also the
               <STRONG>-C</STRONG> option to the <STRONG>set</STRONG> builtin command).

          <STRONG>auto_resume</STRONG>
               This variable controls how the shell interacts with the
               user and job control.  If this variable is set, single
               word simple commands without redirections are treated
               as candidates for resumption of an existing stopped
               job.  There is no ambiguity allowed; if there is more
               than one job beginning with the string typed, the job
               most recently accessed is selected.  The <EM>name</EM> of a
               stopped job, in this context, is the command line used
               to start it.  If set to the value <EM>exact</EM>, the string
               supplied must match the name of a stopped job exactly;
               if set to <EM>substring</EM>, the string supplied needs to match
               a substring of the name of a stopped job.  The
               <EM>substring</EM> value provides functionality analogous to the
               <STRONG>%?</STRONG> job id (see <STRONG>JOB</STRONG> <STRONG>CONTROL</STRONG> below).  If set to any other
               value, the supplied string must be a prefix of a
               stopped job's name; this provides functionality
               analogous to the <STRONG>%</STRONG> job id.

          <STRONG>no_exit_on_failed_exec</STRONG>
               If this variable exists, a non-interactive shell will
               not exit if it cannot execute the file specified in the
               <STRONG>exec</STRONG> builtin command.  An interactive shell does not
               exit if <STRONG>exec</STRONG> fails.

          <STRONG>cdable_vars</STRONG>
               If this is set, an argument to the <STRONG>cd</STRONG> builtin command
               that is not a directory is assumed to be the name of a
               variable whose value is the directory to change to.

     <STRONG>EXPANSION</STRONG>
          Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been
          split into words.  There are seven kinds of expansion
          performed: <EM>brace</EM> <EM>expansion</EM>, <EM>tilde</EM> <EM>expansion</EM>, <EM>parameter</EM> <EM>and</EM>
          <EM>variable</EM> <EM>expansion</EM>, <EM>command</EM> <EM>substitution</EM>, <EM>arithmetic</EM>
          <EM>expansion</EM>, <EM>word</EM> <EM>splitting</EM>, and <EM>pathname</EM> <EM>expansion</EM>.

          The order of expansions is: brace expansion, tilde
          expansion, parameter, variable, command, and arithmetic
          substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion), word
          splitting, and pathname expansion.

          On systems that can support it, there is an additional
          expansion available: <EM>process</EM> <EM>substitution</EM>.

          Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion
          can change the number of words of the expansion; other
          expansions expand a single word to a single word.  The
          single exception to this is the expansion of ``<STRONG>$@</STRONG>'' as
          explained above (see <STRONG>PARAMETERS</STRONG>).

        <STRONG>Brace</STRONG> <STRONG>Expansion</STRONG>
          <EM>Brace</EM> <EM>expansion</EM> is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings
          may be generated.  This mechanism is similar to <EM>pathname</EM>
          <EM>expansion</EM>, but the filenames generated need not exist.
          Patterns to be brace expanded take the form of an optional
          <EM>preamble</EM>, followed by a series of comma-separated strings
          between a pair of braces, followed by an optional <EM>postamble</EM>.
          The preamble is prepended to each string contained within
          the braces, and the postamble is then appended to each
          resulting string, expanding left to right.

          Brace expansions may be nested.  The results of each
          expanded string are not sorted; left to right order is
          preserved.  For example, a<STRONG>{</STRONG>d,c,b<STRONG>}</STRONG>e expands into `ade ace
          abe'.

          Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions,
          and any characters special to other expansions are preserved
          in the result.  It is strictly textual.  <STRONG>Bash</STRONG> does not apply
          any syntactic interpretation to the context of the expansion
          or the text between the braces.

          A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted
          opening and closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma.
          Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is left unchanged.

          This construct is typically used as shorthand when the
          common prefix of the strings to be generated is longer than
          in the above example:

               mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}
          or
               chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}

          Brace expansion introduces a slight incompatibility with
          traditional versions of <STRONG>sh</STRONG>, the Bourne shell.  <STRONG>sh</STRONG> does not
          treat opening or closing braces specially when they appear
          as part of a word, and preserves them in the output.  <STRONG>Bash</STRONG>
          removes braces from words as a consequence of brace
          expansion.  For example, a word entered to <STRONG>sh</STRONG> as <EM>file</EM>{<STRONG>1</STRONG>,<STRONG>2</STRONG>}
          appears identically in the output.  The same word is output
          as <EM>file1</EM> <EM>file2</EM> after expansion by <STRONG>bash</STRONG>.  If strict
          compatibility with <STRONG>sh</STRONG> is desired, start <STRONG>bash</STRONG> with the
          <STRONG>-nobraceexpansion</STRONG> flag (see <STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG> above) or disable brace
          expansion with the <STRONG>+o</STRONG> <STRONG>braceexpand</STRONG> option to the <STRONG>set</STRONG> command
          (see <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG> <STRONG>BUILTIN</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG> below).

        <STRONG>Tilde</STRONG> <STRONG>Expansion</STRONG>
          If a word begins with a tilde character (`<STRONG>~</STRONG>'), all of the
          characters preceding the first slash (or all characters, if
          there is no slash) are treated as a possible <EM>login</EM> <EM>name</EM>. If
          this <EM>login</EM> <EM>name</EM> is the null string, the tilde is replaced
          with the value of the parameter <STRONG>HOME</STRONG>.  If <STRONG>HOME</STRONG> is unset, the
          home directory of the user executing the shell is
          substituted instead.

          If a `+' follows the tilde, the value of <STRONG>PWD</STRONG> replaces the
          tilde and `+'.  If a `-' follows, the value of <STRONG>OLDPWD</STRONG> is
          substituted.  If the value following the tilde is a valid
          <EM>login</EM> <EM>name</EM>, the tilde and <EM>login</EM> <EM>name</EM> are replaced with the
          home directory associated with that name.  If the name is
          invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the word is
          unchanged.

          Each variable assignment is checked for unquoted instances
          of tildes following a <STRONG>:</STRONG> or <STRONG>=</STRONG>.  In these cases, tilde
          substitution is also performed.  Consequently, one may use
          pathnames with tildes in assignments to <STRONG>PATH</STRONG>, <STRONG>MAILPATH</STRONG>, and
          <STRONG>CDPATH</STRONG>, and the shell assigns the expanded value.

        <STRONG>Parameter</STRONG> <STRONG>Expansion</STRONG>
          The `<STRONG>$</STRONG>' character introduces parameter expansion, command
          substitution, or arithmetic expansion.  The parameter name
          or symbol to be expanded may be enclosed in braces, which
          are optional but serve to protect the variable to be
          expanded from characters immediately following it which
          could be interpreted as part of the name.

          ${<EM>parameter</EM>}
               The value of <EM>parameter</EM> is substituted.  The braces are
               required when <EM>parameter</EM> is a positional parameter with
               more than one digit, or when <EM>parameter</EM> is followed by a
               character which is not to be interpreted as part of its
               name.

          In each of the cases below, <EM>word</EM> is subject to tilde
          expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and
          arithmetic expansion.  <STRONG>Bash</STRONG> tests for a parameter that is
          unset or null; omitting the colon results in a test only for
          a parameter that is unset.

          ${<EM>parameter</EM><STRONG>:-</STRONG><EM>word</EM>}
               <STRONG>Use</STRONG> <STRONG>Default</STRONG> <STRONG>Values</STRONG>.  If <EM>parameter</EM> is unset or null, the
               expansion of <EM>word</EM> is substituted.  Otherwise, the value
               of <EM>parameter</EM> is substituted.
          ${<EM>parameter</EM><STRONG>:=</STRONG><EM>word</EM>}
               <STRONG>Assign</STRONG> <STRONG>Default</STRONG> <STRONG>Values</STRONG>.  If <EM>parameter</EM> is unset or null,
               the expansion of <EM>word</EM> is assigned to <EM>parameter</EM>.  The
               value of <EM>parameter</EM> is then substituted.  Positional
               parameters and special parameters may not be assigned
               to in this way.
          ${<EM>parameter</EM><STRONG>:?</STRONG><EM>word</EM>}
               <STRONG>Display</STRONG> <STRONG>Error</STRONG> <STRONG>if</STRONG> <STRONG>Null</STRONG> <STRONG>or</STRONG> <STRONG>Unset</STRONG>.  If <EM>parameter</EM> is null
               or unset, the expansion of <EM>word</EM> (or a message to that
               effect if <EM>word</EM> is not present) is written to the
               standard error and the shell, if it is not interactive,
               exits.  Otherwise, the value of <EM>parameter</EM> is
               substituted.
          ${<EM>parameter</EM><STRONG>:+</STRONG><EM>word</EM>}
               <STRONG>Use</STRONG> <STRONG>Alternate</STRONG> <STRONG>Value</STRONG>.  If <EM>parameter</EM> is null or unset,
               nothing is substituted, otherwise the expansion of <EM>word</EM>
               is substituted.
          ${<STRONG>#</STRONG><EM>parameter</EM>}
               The length in characters of the value of <EM>parameter</EM> is
               substituted.  If <EM>parameter</EM> is <STRONG>*</STRONG> or <STRONG>@</STRONG>, the length
               substituted is the length of <STRONG>*</STRONG> expanded within double
               quotes.
          ${<EM>parameter</EM><STRONG>#</STRONG><EM>word</EM>}
          ${<EM>parameter</EM><STRONG>##</STRONG><EM>word</EM>}
               The <EM>word</EM> is expanded to produce a pattern just as in
               pathname expansion.  If the pattern matches the
               beginning of the value of <EM>parameter</EM>, then the expansion
               is the value of <EM>parameter</EM> with the shortest matching
               pattern deleted (the ``<STRONG>#</STRONG>'' case) or the longest
               matching pattern deleted (the ``<STRONG>##</STRONG>'' case).

          ${<EM>parameter</EM><STRONG>%</STRONG><EM>word</EM>}
          ${<EM>parameter</EM><STRONG>%%</STRONG><EM>word</EM>}
               The <EM>word</EM> is expanded to produce a pattern just as in
               pathname expansion.  If the pattern matches a trailing
               portion of the value of <EM>parameter</EM>, then the expansion
               is the value of <EM>parameter</EM> with the shortest matching
               pattern deleted (the ``<STRONG>%</STRONG>'' case) or the longest
               matching pattern deleted (the ``<STRONG>%%</STRONG>'' case).

        <STRONG>Command</STRONG> <STRONG>Substitution</STRONG>
          <EM>Command</EM> <EM>substitution</EM> allows the output of a command to
          replace the command name.  There are two forms:
               <STRONG>$(</STRONG><EM>command)</EM<STRONG>)</STRONG>
          or
               <STRONG>`</STRONG><EM>command</EM><STRONG>`</STRONG>

          <STRONG>Bash</STRONG> performs the expansion by executing <EM>command</EM> and
          replacing the command substitution with the standard output
          of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted.

          When the old-style backquote form of substitution is used,
          backslash retains its literal meaning except when followed
          by <STRONG>$</STRONG>, <STRONG>`</STRONG>, or <STRONG>\</STRONG>.  When using the $(<EM>command)</EM> form, all
          characters between the parentheses make up the command; none
          are treated specially.

          Command substitutions may be nested.  To nest when using the
          old form, escape the inner backquotes with backslashes.

          If the substitution appears within double quotes, word
          splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the
          results.

        <STRONG>Arithmetic</STRONG> <STRONG>Expansion</STRONG>
          Arithmetic expansion allows the evaluation of an arithmetic
          expression and the substitution of the result.  There are
          two formats for arithmetic expansion:

               <STRONG>$[</STRONG><EM>expression</EM><STRONG>]</STRONG>

               <STRONG>$((</STRONG><EM>expression)</EM<STRONG>))</STRONG>

          The <EM>expression</EM> is treated as if it were within double
          quotes, but a double quote inside the braces or parentheses
          is not treated specially.  All tokens in the expression
          undergo parameter expansion, command substitution, and quote
          removal.  Arithmetic substitutions may be nested.

          The evaluation is performed according to the rules listed
          below under <STRONG>ARITHMETIC</STRONG> <STRONG>EVALUATION</STRONG>.  If <EM>expression</EM> is
          invalid, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> prints a message indicating failure and no
          substitution occurs.

        <STRONG>Process</STRONG> <STRONG>Substitution</STRONG>
          <EM>Process</EM> <EM>substitution</EM> is supported on systems that support
          named pipes (<EM>FIFOs)</EM> or the <STRONG>/dev/fd</STRONG> method of naming open
          files.  It takes the form of <STRONG>&lt;(</STRONG><EM>list)</EM<STRONG>)</STRONG> or <STRONG>&gt;(</STRONG><EM>list)</EM<STRONG>)</STRONG>.  The
          process <EM>list</EM> is run with its input or output connected to a
          <EM>FIFO</EM> or some file in <STRONG>/dev/fd</STRONG>.  The name of this file is
          passed as an argument to the current command as the result
          of the expansion.  If the <STRONG>&gt;(</STRONG><EM>list)</EM<STRONG>)</STRONG> form is used, writing to
          the file will provide input for <EM>list</EM>.  If the <STRONG>&lt;(</STRONG><EM>list)</EM<STRONG>)</STRONG> form
          is used, the file passed as an argument should be read to
          obtain the output of <EM>list</EM>.
          On systems that support it, <EM>process</EM> <EM>substitution</EM> is
          performed simultaneously with <EM>parameter</EM> <EM>and</EM> <EM>variable</EM>
          <EM>expansion</EM>, <EM>command</EM> <EM>substitution</EM>, and <EM>arithmetic</EM> <EM>expansion</EM>.

        <STRONG>Word</STRONG> <STRONG>Splitting</STRONG>
          The shell scans the results of parameter expansion, command
          substitution, and arithmetic expansion that did not occur
          within double quotes for <EM>word</EM> <EM>splitting</EM>.

          The shell treats each character of <STRONG>IFS</STRONG> as a delimiter, and
          splits the results of the other expansions into words on
          these characters.  If the value of <STRONG>IFS</STRONG> is exactly
          <STRONG>&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;</STRONG>, the default, then any sequence of <STRONG>IFS</STRONG>
          characters serves to delimit words.  If <STRONG>IFS</STRONG> has a value
          other than the default, then sequences of the whitespace
          characters <STRONG>space</STRONG> and <STRONG>tab</STRONG> are ignored at the beginning and
          end of the word, as long as the whitespace character is in
          the value of <STRONG>IFS</STRONG> (an <STRONG>IFS</STRONG> whitespace character).  Any
          character in <STRONG>IFS</STRONG> that is not <STRONG>IFS</STRONG> whitespace, along with any
          adjacent <STRONG>IFS</STRONG> whitespace characters, delimits a field.  A
          sequence of <STRONG>IFS</STRONG> whitespace characters is also treated as a
          delimiter.  If the value of <STRONG>IFS</STRONG> is null, no word splitting
          occurs.  <STRONG>IFS</STRONG> cannot be unset.

          Explicit null arguments (<STRONG>""</STRONG> or <STRONG>''</STRONG>) are retained.  Implicit
          null arguments, resulting from the expansion of <EM>parameters</EM>
          that have no values, are removed.

          Note that if no expansion occurs, no splitting is performed.

        <STRONG>Pathname</STRONG> <STRONG>Expansion</STRONG>
          After word splitting, unless the <STRONG>-f</STRONG> option has been set,
          <STRONG>bash</STRONG> scans each <EM>word</EM> for the characters <STRONG>*</STRONG>, <STRONG>?</STRONG>, and <STRONG>[</STRONG>.  If one
          of these characters appears, then the word is regarded as a
          <EM>pattern</EM>, and replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of
          pathnames matching the pattern.  If no matching pathnames
          are found, and the shell variable <STRONG>allow_null_glob_expansion</STRONG>
          is unset, the word is left unchanged.  If the variable is
          set, and no matches are found, the word is removed.  When a
          pattern is used for pathname generation, the character <STRONG>``.''</STRONG>
          at the start of a name or immediately following a slash must
          be matched explicitly, unless the shell variable
          <STRONG>glob_dot_filenames</STRONG> is set.  The slash character must always
          be matched explicitly.  In other cases, the <STRONG>``.''</STRONG> character
          is not treated specially.

          The special pattern characters have the following meanings:

          <STRONG>*</STRONG>    Matches any string, including the null string.
          <STRONG>?</STRONG>    Matches any single character.
          <STRONG>[...]</STRONG>
               Matches any one of the enclosed characters.  A pair of
               characters separated by a minus sign denotes a <EM>range</EM>;
               any character lexically between those two characters,
               inclusive, is matched.  If the first character
               following the <STRONG>[</STRONG> is a <STRONG>!</STRONG> or a <STRONG>^</STRONG> then any character not
               enclosed is matched.  A <STRONG>-</STRONG> or <STRONG>]</STRONG> may be matched by
               including it as the first or last character in the set.

        <STRONG>Quote</STRONG> <STRONG>Removal</STRONG>
          After the preceding expansions, all unquoted occurrences of
          the characters <STRONG>\</STRONG>, <STRONG>`</STRONG>, and <STRONG>"</STRONG> are removed.

     <STRONG>REDIRECTION</STRONG>
          Before a command is executed, its input and output may be
          <EM>redirected</EM> using a special notation interpreted by the
          shell.  Redirection may also be used to open and close files
          for the current shell execution environment.  The following
          redirection operators may precede or appear anywhere within
          a <EM>simple</EM> <EM>command</EM> or may follow a <EM>command</EM>.  Redirections are
          processed in the order they appear, from left to right.

          In the following descriptions, if the file descriptor number
          is omitted, and the first character of the redirection
          operator is <STRONG>&lt;</STRONG>, the redirection refers to the standard input
          (file descriptor 0).  If the first character of the
          redirection operator is <STRONG>&gt;</STRONG>, the redirection refers to the
          standard output (file descriptor 1).

          The word that follows the redirection operator in the
          following descriptions is subjected to brace expansion,
          tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution,
          arithmetic expansion, quote removal, and pathname expansion.
          If it expands to more than one word, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> reports an error.

          Note that the order of redirections is significant.  For
          example, the command

               ls <STRONG>&gt;</STRONG> dirlist 2<STRONG>&gt;&amp;</STRONG>1

          directs both standard output and standard error to the file
          <EM>dirlist</EM>, while the command

               ls 2<STRONG>&gt;&amp;</STRONG>1 <STRONG>&gt;</STRONG> dirlist

          directs only the standard output to file <EM>dirlist</EM>, because
          the standard error was duplicated as standard output before
          the standard output was redirected to <EM>dirlist</EM>.

        <STRONG>Redirecting</STRONG> <STRONG>Input</STRONG>
          Redirection of input causes the file whose name results from
          the expansion of <EM>word</EM> to be opened for reading on file
          descriptor <STRONG>n</STRONG>, or the standard input (file descriptor 0) if <STRONG>n</STRONG>
          is not specified.
          The general format for redirecting input is:

               [<STRONG>n</STRONG>]<STRONG>&lt;</STRONG><EM>word</EM>

        <STRONG>Redirecting</STRONG> <STRONG>Output</STRONG>
          Redirection of output causes the file whose name results
          from the expansion of <EM>word</EM> to be opened for writing on file
          descriptor <STRONG>n</STRONG>, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if
          <STRONG>n</STRONG> is not specified.  If the file does not exist it is
          created; if it does exist it is truncated to zero size.

          The general format for redirecting output is:

               [<STRONG>n</STRONG>]<STRONG>&gt;</STRONG><EM>word</EM>

          If the redirection operator is <STRONG>&gt;|</STRONG>, then the value of the <STRONG>-C</STRONG>
          option to the <STRONG>set</STRONG> builtin command is not tested, and file
          creation is attempted.  (See also the description of
          <STRONG>noclobber</STRONG> under <STRONG>Shell</STRONG> <STRONG>Variables</STRONG> above.)

        <STRONG>Appending</STRONG> <STRONG>Redirected</STRONG> <STRONG>Output</STRONG>
          Redirection of output in this fashion causes the file whose
          name results from the expansion of <EM>word</EM> to be opened for
          appending on file descriptor <STRONG>n</STRONG>, or the standard output (file
          descriptor 1) if <STRONG>n</STRONG> is not specified.  If the file does not
          exist it is created.

          The general format for appending output is:

               [<STRONG>n</STRONG>]<STRONG>&gt;&gt;</STRONG><EM>word</EM>

        <STRONG>Redirecting</STRONG> <STRONG>Standard</STRONG> <STRONG>Output</STRONG> <STRONG>and</STRONG> <STRONG>Standard</STRONG> <STRONG>Error</STRONG>
          <STRONG>Bash</STRONG> allows both the standard output (file descriptor 1) and
          the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to be
          redirected to the file whose name is the expansion of <EM>word</EM>
          with this construct.

          There are two formats for redirecting standard output and
          standard error:

               <STRONG>&amp;&gt;</STRONG><EM>word</EM>
          and
               <STRONG>&gt;&amp;</STRONG><EM>word</EM>

          Of the two forms, the first is preferred.  This is
          semantically equivalent to

               <STRONG>&gt;</STRONG><EM>word</EM> 2<STRONG>&gt;&amp;</STRONG>1

        <STRONG>Here</STRONG> <STRONG>Documents</STRONG>
          This type of redirection instructs the shell to read input
          from the current source until a line containing only <EM>word</EM>
          (with no trailing blanks) is seen.  All of the lines read up
          to that point are then used as the standard input for a
          command.

          The format of here-documents is as follows:

               <STRONG>&lt;&lt;</STRONG>[<STRONG>-</STRONG>]<EM>word</EM>
                       <EM>here</EM>-<EM>document</EM>
               <EM>delimiter</EM>

          No parameter expansion, command substitution, pathname
          expansion, or arithmetic expansion is performed on <EM>word</EM>.  If
          any characters in <EM>word</EM> are quoted, the <EM>delimiter</EM> is the
          result of quote removal on <EM>word</EM>, and the lines in the here-
          document are not expanded.  Otherwise, all lines of the
          here-document are subjected to parameter expansion, command
          substitution, and arithmetic expansion.  In the latter case,
          the pair <STRONG>\&lt;newline&gt;</STRONG> is ignored, and <STRONG>\</STRONG> must be used to quote
          the characters <STRONG>\</STRONG>, <STRONG>$</STRONG>, and <STRONG>`</STRONG>.

          If the redirection operator is <STRONG>&lt;&lt;-</STRONG>, then all leading tab
          characters are stripped from input lines and the line
          containing <EM>delimiter</EM>.  This allows here-documents within
          shell scripts to be indented in a natural fashion.

        <STRONG>Duplicating</STRONG> <STRONG>File</STRONG> <STRONG>Descriptors</STRONG>
          The redirection operator

               [<STRONG>n</STRONG>]<STRONG>&lt;&amp;</STRONG><EM>word</EM>

          is used to duplicate input file descriptors.  If <EM>word</EM>
          expands to one or more digits, the file descriptor denoted
          by <STRONG>n</STRONG> is made to be a copy of that file descriptor.  If <EM>word</EM>
          evaluates to <STRONG>-</STRONG>, file descriptor <STRONG>n</STRONG> is closed.  If <STRONG>n</STRONG> is not
          specified, the standard input (file descriptor 0) is used.

          The operator

               [<STRONG>n</STRONG>]<STRONG>&gt;&amp;</STRONG><EM>word</EM>

          is used similarly to duplicate output file descriptors.  If
          <STRONG>n</STRONG> is not specified, the standard output (file descriptor 1)
          is used.  As a special case, if <STRONG>n</STRONG> is omitted, and <EM>word</EM> does
          not expand to one or more digits, the standard output and
          standard error are redirected as described previously.

        <STRONG>Opening</STRONG> <STRONG>File</STRONG> <STRONG>Descriptors</STRONG> <STRONG>for</STRONG> <STRONG>Reading</STRONG> <STRONG>and</STRONG> <STRONG>Writing</STRONG>
          The redirection operator

               [<STRONG>n</STRONG>]<STRONG>&lt;&gt;</STRONG><EM>word</EM>

          causes the file whose name is the expansion of <EM>word</EM> to be
          opened for both reading and writing on file descriptor <STRONG>n</STRONG>, or
          as the standard input and standard output if <STRONG>n</STRONG> is not
          specified.  If the file does not exist, it is created.

     <STRONG>FUNCTIONS</STRONG>
          A shell function, defined as described above under <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG>
          <STRONG>GRAMMAR</STRONG>, stores a series of commands for later execution.
          Functions are executed in the context of the current shell;
          no new process is created to interpret them (contrast this
          with the execution of a shell script).  When a function is
          executed, the arguments to the function become the
          positional parameters during its execution.  The special
          parameter <STRONG>#</STRONG> is updated to reflect the change.  Positional
          parameter 0 is unchanged.

          Variables local to the function may be declared with the
          <STRONG>local</STRONG> builtin command.  Ordinarily, variables and their
          values are shared between the function and its caller.

          If the builtin command <STRONG>return</STRONG> is executed in a function, the
          function completes and execution resumes with the next
          command after the function call.  When a function completes,
          the values of the positional parameters and the special
          parameter <STRONG>#</STRONG> are restored to the values they had prior to
          function execution.

          Function names may be listed with the <STRONG>-f</STRONG> option to the
          <STRONG>declare</STRONG> or <STRONG>typeset</STRONG> builtin commands.  Functions may be
          exported so that subshells automatically have them defined
          with the <STRONG>-f</STRONG> option to the <STRONG>export</STRONG> builtin.

          Functions may be recursive.  No limit is imposed on the
          number of recursive calls.

     <STRONG>ALIASES</STRONG>
          The shell maintains a list of <EM>aliases</EM> that may be set and
          unset with the <STRONG>alias</STRONG> and <STRONG>unalias</STRONG> builtin commands (see <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG>
          <STRONG>BUILTIN</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG> below).  The first word of each command, if
          unquoted, is checked to see if it has an alias.  If so, that
          word is replaced by the text of the alias.  The alias name
          and the replacement text may contain any valid shell input,
          including the <EM>metacharacters</EM> listed above, with the
          exception that the alias name may not contain =.  The first
          word of the replacement text is tested for aliases, but a
          word that is identical to an alias being expanded is not
          expanded a second time.  This means that one may alias <STRONG>ls</STRONG> to
          <STRONG>ls</STRONG> <STRONG>-F</STRONG>, for instance, and <STRONG>bash</STRONG> does not try to recursively
          expand the replacement text.  If the last character of the
          alias value is a <EM>blank</EM>, then the next command word following
          the alias is also checked for alias expansion.

          Aliases are created and listed with the <STRONG>alias</STRONG> command, and
          removed with the <STRONG>unalias</STRONG> command.

          There is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement
          text, as in <STRONG>csh</STRONG>.  If arguments are needed, a shell function
          should be used.

          Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive.

          The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are
          somewhat confusing.  <STRONG>Bash</STRONG> always reads at least one complete
          line of input before executing any of the commands on that
          line.  Aliases are expanded when a command is read, not when
          it is executed.  Therefore, an alias definition appearing on
          the same line as another command does not take effect until
          the next line of input is read.  This means that the
          commands following the alias definition on that line are not
          affected by the new alias.  This behavior is also an issue
          when functions are executed.  Aliases are expanded when the
          function definition is read, not when the function is
          executed, because a function definition is itself a compound
          command.  As a consequence, aliases defined in a function
          are not available until after that function is executed.  To
          be safe, always put alias definitions on a separate line,
          and do not use <STRONG>alias</STRONG> in compound commands.

          Note that for almost every purpose, aliases are superseded
          by shell functions.

     <STRONG>JOB</STRONG> <STRONG>CONTROL</STRONG>
          <EM>Job</EM> <EM>control</EM> refers to the ability to selectively stop
          (<EM>suspend)</EM> the execution of processes and continue (<EM>resume)</EM>
          their execution at a later point.  A user typically employs
          this facility via an interactive interface supplied jointly
          by the system's terminal driver and <STRONG>bash</STRONG>.

          The shell associates a <EM>job</EM> with each pipeline.  It keeps a
          table of currently executing jobs, which may be listed with
          the <STRONG>jobs</STRONG> command.  When <STRONG>bash</STRONG> starts a job asynchronously (in
          the <EM>background)</EM>, it prints a line that looks like:

               [1] 25647

          indicating that this job is job number 1 and that the
          process ID of the last process in the pipeline associated
          with this job is 25647.  All of the processes in a single
          pipeline are members of the same job.  <STRONG>Bash</STRONG> uses the <EM>job</EM>
          abstraction as the basis for job control.

          To facilitate the implementation of the user interface to
          job control, the system maintains the notion of a <EM>current</EM>
          <EM>terminal</EM> <EM>process</EM> <EM>group</EM> <EM>ID</EM>.  Members of this process group
          (processes whose process group ID is equal to the current
          terminal process group ID) receive keyboard-generated
          signals such as <STRONG>SIGINT</STRONG>.  These processes are said to be in
          the <EM>foreground</EM>.  <EM>Background</EM> processes are those whose
          process group ID differs from the terminal's; such processes
          are immune to keyboard-generated signals.  Only foreground
          processes are allowed to read from or write to the terminal.
          Background processes which attempt to read from (write to)
          the terminal are sent a <STRONG>SIGTTIN</STRONG> <STRONG>(SIGTTOU)</STRONG> signal by the
          terminal driver, which, unless caught, suspends the process.

          If the operating system on which <STRONG>bash</STRONG> is running supports
          job control, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> allows you to use it.  Typing the <EM>suspend</EM>
          character (typically <STRONG>^Z</STRONG>, Control-Z) while a process is
          running causes that process to be stopped and returns you to
          <STRONG>bash</STRONG>.  Typing the <EM>delayed</EM> <EM>suspend</EM> character (typically <STRONG>^Y</STRONG>,
          Control-Y) causes the process to be stopped when it attempts
          to read input from the terminal, and control to be returned
          to <STRONG>bash</STRONG>.  You may then manipulate the state of this job,
          using the <STRONG>bg</STRONG> command to continue it in the background, the
          <STRONG>fg</STRONG> command to continue it in the foreground, or the <STRONG>kill</STRONG>
          command to kill it.  A <STRONG>^Z</STRONG> takes effect immediately, and has
          the additional side effect of causing pending output and
          typeahead to be discarded.

          There are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell.
          The character <STRONG>%</STRONG> introduces a job name.  Job number <STRONG>n</STRONG> may be
          referred to as <STRONG>%n</STRONG>.  A job may also be referred to using a
          prefix of the name used to start it, or using a substring
          that appears in its command line.  For example, <STRONG>%ce</STRONG> refers
          to a stopped <STRONG>ce</STRONG> job.  If a prefix matches more than one job,
          <STRONG>bash</STRONG> reports an error.  Using <STRONG>%?ce</STRONG>, on the other hand,
          refers to any job containing the string <STRONG>ce</STRONG> in its command
          line.  If the substring matches more than one job, <STRONG>bash</STRONG>
          reports an error.  The symbols <STRONG>%%</STRONG> and <STRONG>%+</STRONG> refer to the
          shell's notion of the <EM>current</EM> <EM>job</EM>, which is the last job
          stopped while it was in the foreground.  The <EM>previous</EM> <EM>job</EM>
          may be referenced using <STRONG>%-</STRONG>.  In output pertaining to jobs
          (e.g., the output of the <STRONG>jobs</STRONG> command), the current job is
          always flagged with a <STRONG>+</STRONG>, and the previous job with a <STRONG>-</STRONG>.

          Simply naming a job can be used to bring it into the
          foreground: <STRONG>%1</STRONG> is a synonym for <STRONG>``fg</STRONG> <STRONG>%1''</STRONG>, bringing job 1
          from the background into the foreground.  Similarly, <STRONG>``%1</STRONG>
          <STRONG>&amp;''</STRONG> resumes job 1 in the background, equivalent to <STRONG>``bg</STRONG>
          <STRONG>%1''</STRONG>.

          The shell learns immediately whenever a job changes state.
          Normally, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> waits until it is about to print a prompt
          before reporting changes in a job's status so as to not
          interrupt any other output.  If the <STRONG>-b</STRONG> option to the <STRONG>set</STRONG>
          builtin command is set, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> reports such changes
          immediately.  (See also the description of <STRONG>notify</STRONG> variable
          under <STRONG>Shell</STRONG> <STRONG>Variables</STRONG> above.)

          If you attempt to exit <STRONG>bash</STRONG> while jobs are stopped, the
          shell prints a message warning you.  You may then use the
          <STRONG>jobs</STRONG> command to inspect their status.  If you do this, or
          try to exit again immediately, you are not warned again, and
          the stopped jobs are terminated.

     <STRONG>SIGNALS</STRONG>
          When <STRONG>bash</STRONG> is interactive, it ignores <STRONG>SIGTERM</STRONG> (so that <STRONG>kill</STRONG> <STRONG>0</STRONG>
          does not kill an interactive shell), and <STRONG>SIGINT</STRONG> is caught
          and handled (so that the <STRONG>wait</STRONG> builtin is interruptible).  In
          all cases, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> ignores <STRONG>SIGQUIT</STRONG>.  If job control is in
          effect, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> ignores <STRONG>SIGTTIN</STRONG>, <STRONG>SIGTTOU</STRONG>, and <STRONG>SIGTSTP</STRONG>.

          Synchronous jobs started by <STRONG>bash</STRONG> have signals set to the
          values inherited by the shell from its parent.  When job
          control is not in effect, background jobs (jobs started with
          <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>) ignore <STRONG>SIGINT</STRONG> and <STRONG>SIGQUIT</STRONG>.  Commands run as a result of
          command substitution ignore the keyboard-generated job
          control signals <STRONG>SIGTTIN</STRONG>, <STRONG>SIGTTOU</STRONG>, and <STRONG>SIGTSTP</STRONG>.

     <STRONG>COMMAND</STRONG> <STRONG>EXECUTION</STRONG>
          After a command has been split into words, if it results in
          a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the
          following actions are taken.

          If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts
          to locate it.  If there exists a shell function by that
          name, that function is invoked as described above in
          <STRONG>FUNCTIONS</STRONG>.  If the name does not match a function, the shell
          searches for it in the list of shell builtins.  If a match
          is found, that builtin is invoked.

          If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and
          contains no slashes, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> searches each element of the <STRONG>PATH</STRONG>
          for a directory containing an executable file by that name.
          If the search is unsuccessful, the shell prints an error
          message and returns a nonzero exit status.

          If the search is successful, or if the command name contains
          one or more slashes, the shell executes the named program.
          Argument 0 is set to the name given, and the remaining
          arguments to the command are set to the arguments given, if
          any.

          If this execution fails because the file is not in
          executable format, and the file is not a directory, it is
          assumed to be a <EM>shell</EM> <EM>script</EM>, a file containing shell
          commands.  A subshell is spawned to execute it.  This
          subshell reinitializes itself, so that the effect is as if a
          new shell had been invoked to handle the script, with the
          exception that the locations of commands remembered by the
          parent (see <STRONG>hash</STRONG> below under <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG> <STRONG>BUILTIN</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG>) are
          retained by the child.

          If the program is a file beginning with <STRONG>#!</STRONG>, the remainder of
          the first line specifies an interpreter for the program.
          The shell executes the specified interpreter on operating
          systems that do not handle this executable format
          themselves.  The arguments to the interpreter consist of a
          single optional argument following the interpreter name on
          the first line of the program, followed by the name of the
          program, followed by the command arguments, if any.

     <STRONG>ENVIRONMENT</STRONG>
          When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings
          called the <EM>environment</EM>.  This is a list of <EM>name</EM>-<EM>value</EM> pairs,
          of the form <EM>name</EM>=<EM>value</EM>.

          The shell allows you to manipulate the environment in
          several ways.  On invocation, the shell scans its own
          environment and creates a parameter for each name found,
          automatically marking it for <EM>export</EM> to child processes.
          Executed commands inherit the environment.  The <STRONG>export</STRONG> and
          <STRONG>declare</STRONG> <STRONG>-x</STRONG> commands allow parameters and functions to be
          added to and deleted from the environment.  If the value of
          a parameter in the environment is modified, the new value
          becomes part of the environment, replacing the old.  The
          environment inherited by any executed command consists of
          the shell's initial environment, whose values may be
          modified in the shell, less any pairs removed by the <STRONG>unset</STRONG>
          command, plus any additions via the <STRONG>export</STRONG> and <STRONG>declare</STRONG> <STRONG>-x</STRONG>
          commands.

          The environment for any <EM>simple</EM> <EM>command</EM> or function may be
          augmented temporarily by prefixing it with parameter
          assignments, as described above in <STRONG>PARAMETERS</STRONG>.  These
          assignment statements affect only the environment seen by
          that command.

          If the <STRONG>-k</STRONG> flag is set (see the <STRONG>set</STRONG> builtin command below),
          then <EM>all</EM> parameter assignments are placed in the environment
          for a command, not just those that precede the command name.

          When <STRONG>bash</STRONG> invokes an external command, the variable <STRONG>_</STRONG> is set
          to the full path name of the command and passed to that
          command in its environment.

     <STRONG>EXIT</STRONG> <STRONG>STATUS</STRONG>
          For the purposes of the shell, a command which exits with a
          zero exit status has succeeded.  An exit status of zero
          indicates success.  A non-zero exit status indicates
          failure.  When a command terminates on a fatal signal, <STRONG>bash</STRONG>
          uses the value of 128+<STRONG>signal</STRONG> as the exit status.

          If a command is not found, the child process created to
          execute it returns a status of 127.  If a command is found
          but is not executable, the return status is 126.

          <STRONG>Bash</STRONG> itself returns the exit status of the last command
          executed, unless a syntax error occurs, in which case it
          exits with a non-zero value.  See also the <STRONG>exit</STRONG> builtin
          command below.

     <STRONG>PROMPTING</STRONG>
          When executing interactively, <STRONG>bash</STRONG> displays the primary
          prompt <STRONG>PS1</STRONG> when it is ready to read a command, and the
          secondary prompt <STRONG>PS2</STRONG> when it needs more input to complete a
          command.  <STRONG>Bash</STRONG> allows these prompt strings to be customized
          by inserting a number of backslash-escaped special
          characters that are decoded as follows:
               <STRONG>\t</STRONG>   the current time in HH:MM:SS format
               <STRONG>\d</STRONG>   the date in "Weekday Month Date" format (e.g.,
                    "Tue May 26")
               <STRONG>\n</STRONG>   newline
               <STRONG>\s</STRONG>   the name of the shell, the basename of <STRONG>$0</STRONG> (the
                    portion following the final slash)
               <STRONG>\w</STRONG>   the current working directory
               <STRONG>\W</STRONG>   the basename of the current working directory
               <STRONG>\u</STRONG>   the username of the current user
               <STRONG>\h</STRONG>   the hostname
               <STRONG>\#</STRONG>   the command number of this command
               <STRONG>\!</STRONG>   the history number of this command
               <STRONG>\$</STRONG>   if the effective UID is 0, a <STRONG>#</STRONG>, otherwise a <STRONG>$</STRONG>
               <STRONG>\nnn</STRONG> the character corresponding to the octal number
                    <STRONG>nnn</STRONG>
               <STRONG>\\</STRONG>   a backslash
               <STRONG>\[</STRONG>   begin a sequence of non-printing characters, which
                    could be used to embed a terminal control sequence
                    into the prompt
               <STRONG>\]</STRONG>   end a sequence of non-printing characters

          The command number and the history number are usually
          different: the history number of a command is its position
          in the history list, which may include commands restored
          from the history file (see <STRONG>HISTORY</STRONG> below), while the command
          number is the position in the sequence of commands executed
          during the current shell session.  After the string is
          decoded, it is expanded via parameter expansion, command
          substitution, arithmetic expansion, and word splitting.

     <STRONG>READLINE</STRONG>
          This is the library that handles reading input when using an
          interactive shell, unless the <STRONG>-nolineediting</STRONG> option is
          given.  By default, the line editing commands are similar to
          those of emacs.  A vi-style line editing interface is also
          available.

          In this section, the emacs-style notation is used to denote
          keystrokes.  Control keys are denoted by C-<EM>key</EM>, e.g., C-n
          means Control-N.  Similarly, <EM>meta</EM> keys are denoted by M-<EM>key</EM>,
          so M-x means Meta-X.  (On keyboards without a <EM>meta</EM> key, M-<STRONG>x</STRONG>
          means ESC <STRONG>x</STRONG>, i.e., press the Escape key then the <STRONG>x</STRONG> key.
          This makes ESC the <EM>meta</EM> <EM>prefix</EM>.  The combination M-C-<STRONG>x</STRONG> means
          ESC-Control-<STRONG>x</STRONG>, or press the Escape key then hold the Control
          key while pressing the <STRONG>x</STRONG> key.)

          The default key-bindings may be changed with an ~/.<EM>inputrc</EM>
          file.  The value of the shell variable <STRONG>INPUTRC</STRONG>, if set, is
          used instead of ~/.<EM>inputrc</EM>.  Other programs that use this
          library may add their own commands and bindings.

          For example, placing

               M-Control-u: universal-argument
          or
               C-Meta-u: universal-argument
          into the ~/.<EM>inputrc</EM> would make M-C-u execute the readline
          command <EM>universal</EM>-<EM>argument</EM>.

          The following symbolic character names are recognized:
          <EM>RUBOUT</EM>, <EM>DEL</EM>, <EM>ESC</EM>, <EM>LFD</EM>, <EM>NEWLINE</EM>, <EM>RET</EM>, <EM>RETURN</EM>, <EM>SPC</EM>, <EM>SPACE</EM>, and
          <EM>TAB</EM>.  In addition to command names, readline allows keys to
          be bound to a string that is inserted when the key is
          pressed (a <EM>macro)</EM>.

          Readline is customized by putting commands in an
          initialization file.  The name of this file is taken from
          the value of the <STRONG>INPUTRC</STRONG> variable.  If that variable is
          unset, the default is ~/.<EM>inputrc</EM>.  When a program which uses
          the readline library starts up, the init file is read, and
          the key bindings and variables are set.  There are only a
          few basic constructs allowed in the readline init file.
          Blank lines are ignored.  Lines beginning with a <STRONG>#</STRONG> are
          comments.  Lines beginning with a <STRONG>$</STRONG> indicate conditional
          constructs.  Other lines denote key bindings and variable
          settings.

          The syntax for controlling key bindings in the ~/.<EM>inputrc</EM>
          file is simple.  All that is required is the name of the
          command or the text of a macro and a key sequence to which
          it should be bound. The name may be specified in one of two
          ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with <EM>Meta</EM>- or
          <EM>Control</EM>- prefixes, or as a key sequence.  When using the
          form <STRONG>keyname</STRONG>:<EM>function</EM>-<EM>name</EM> or <EM>macro</EM>, <EM>keyname</EM> is the name of
          a key spelled out in English.  For example:

               Control-u: universal-argument
               Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
               Control-o: "&gt;&amp;output"

          In the above example, <STRONG>C</STRONG>-<STRONG>u</STRONG> is bound to the function
          <STRONG>universal-argument</STRONG>, <STRONG>M</STRONG>-<EM>DEL</EM> is bound to the function
          <STRONG>backward-kill-word</STRONG>, and <STRONG>C</STRONG>-<STRONG>o</STRONG> is bound to run the macro
          expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the
          text &gt;&amp;<EM>output</EM> into the line).

          In the second form, <STRONG>"keyseq"</STRONG>:<EM>function</EM>-<EM>name</EM> or <EM>macro</EM>, <STRONG>keyseq</STRONG>
          differs from <STRONG>keyname</STRONG> above in that strings denoting an
          entire key sequence may be specified by placing the sequence
          within double quotes.  Some GNU Emacs style key escapes can
          be used, as in the following example.

               "\C-u": universal-argument
               "\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
               "\e[11~": "Function Key 1"

          In this example, <STRONG>C</STRONG>-<STRONG>u</STRONG> is again bound to the function
          <STRONG>universal-argument</STRONG>.  <STRONG>C</STRONG>-<STRONG>x</STRONG> <STRONG>C</STRONG>-<STRONG>r</STRONG> is bound to the function
          <STRONG>re-read-init-file</STRONG>, and <EM>ESC</EM> [ <STRONG>1</STRONG> <STRONG>1</STRONG> ~ is bound to insert the
          text <STRONG>Function</STRONG> <STRONG>Key</STRONG> <STRONG>1</STRONG>.  The full set of escape sequences is

               <STRONG>\C-</STRONG>  control prefix

               <STRONG>\M-</STRONG>  meta prefix

               <STRONG>\e</STRONG>   an escape character

               <STRONG>\\</STRONG>   backslash

               <STRONG>\"</STRONG>   literal "

               <STRONG>\'</STRONG>   literal '

          When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes
          should be used to indicate a macro definition.  Unquoted
          text is assumed to be a function name.  Backslash will quote
          any character in the macro text, including " and '.

          <STRONG>Bash</STRONG> allows the current readline key bindings to be
          displayed or modified with the <STRONG>bind</STRONG> builtin command.  The
          editing mode may be switched during interactive use by using
          the <STRONG>-o</STRONG> option to the <STRONG>set</STRONG> builtin command (see <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG> <STRONG>BUILTIN</STRONG>
          <STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG> below).

          Readline has variables that can be used to further customize
          its behavior.  A variable may be set in the <EM>inputrc</EM> file
          with a statement of the form

               <STRONG>set</STRONG> <EM>variable</EM>-<EM>name</EM> <EM>value</EM>

          Except where noted, readline variables can take the values
          <STRONG>On</STRONG> or <STRONG>Off</STRONG>.  The variables and their default values are:

          <STRONG>horizontal-scroll-mode</STRONG> <STRONG>(Off)</STRONG>
               When set to <STRONG>On</STRONG>, makes readline use a single line for
               display, scrolling the input horizontally on a single
               screen line when it becomes longer than the screen
               width rather than wrapping to a new line.
          <STRONG>editing-mode</STRONG> <STRONG>(emacs)</STRONG>
               Controls whether readline begins with a set of key
               bindings similar to <EM>emacs</EM> or <EM>vi</EM>.  <STRONG>editing-mode</STRONG> can be
               set to either <STRONG>emacs</STRONG> or <STRONG>vi</STRONG>.
          <STRONG>mark-modified-lines</STRONG> <STRONG>(Off)</STRONG>
               If set to <STRONG>On</STRONG>, history lines that have been modified are
               displayed with a preceding asterisk (<STRONG>*</STRONG>).
          <STRONG>bell-style</STRONG> <STRONG>(audible)</STRONG>
               Controls what happens when readline wants to ring the
               terminal bell.  If set to <STRONG>none</STRONG>, readline never rings
               the bell.  If set to <STRONG>visible</STRONG>, readline uses a visible
               bell if one is available.  If set to <STRONG>audible</STRONG>, readline
               attempts to ring the terminal's bell.
          <STRONG>comment-begin</STRONG> <STRONG>(``#'')</STRONG>
               The string that is inserted in <STRONG>vi</STRONG> mode when the
               <STRONG>vi-comment</STRONG> command is executed.
          <STRONG>meta-flag</STRONG> <STRONG>(Off)</STRONG>
               If set to <STRONG>On</STRONG>, readline will enable eight-bit input
               (that is, it will not strip the high bit from the
               characters it reads), regardless of what the terminal
               claims it can support.
          <STRONG>convert-meta</STRONG> <STRONG>(On)</STRONG>
               If set to <STRONG>On</STRONG>, readline will convert characters with the
               eighth bit set to an ASCII key sequence by stripping
               the eighth bit and prepending an escape character (in
               effect, using escape as the <EM>meta</EM> <EM>prefix)</EM>.
          <STRONG>output-meta</STRONG> <STRONG>(Off)</STRONG>
               If set to <STRONG>On</STRONG>, readline will display characters with the
               eighth bit set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed
               escape sequence.
          <STRONG>completion-query-items</STRONG> <STRONG>(100)</STRONG>
               This determines when the user is queried about viewing
               the number of possible completions generated by the
               <STRONG>possible-completions</STRONG> command.  It may be set to any
               integer value greater than or equal to zero.  If the
               number of possible completions is greater than or equal
               to the value of this variable, the user is asked
               whether or not he wishes to view them; otherwise they
               are simply listed on the terminal.
          <STRONG>keymap</STRONG> <STRONG>(emacs)</STRONG>
               Set the current readline keymap.  The set of legal
               keymap names is <EM>emacs</EM>, <EM>emacs</EM>-<EM>standard</EM>, <EM>emacs</EM>-<EM>meta</EM>,
               <EM>emacs</EM>-<EM>ctlx</EM>, <EM>vi,</EM> <EM>vi-move,</EM> <EM>vi-command</EM>, and <EM>vi</EM>-<EM>insert</EM>.  <EM>vi</EM>
               is equivalent to <EM>vi</EM>-<EM>command</EM>; <EM>emacs</EM> is equivalent to
               <EM>emacs</EM>-<EM>standard</EM>.  The default value is <EM>emacs</EM>; the value
               of <STRONG>editing-mode</STRONG> also affects the default keymap.
          <STRONG>show-all-if-ambiguous</STRONG> <STRONG>(Off)</STRONG>
               This alters the default behavior of the completion
               functions.  If set to <STRONG>on</STRONG>, words which have more than
               one possible completion cause the matches to be listed
               immediately instead of ringing the bell.
          <STRONG>expand-tilde</STRONG> <STRONG>(Off)</STRONG>
               If set to <STRONG>on</STRONG>, tilde expansion is performed when
               readline attempts word completion.

          Readline implements a facility similar in spirit to the
          conditional compilation features of the C preprocessor which
          allows key bindings and variable settings to be performed as
          the result of tests.  There are three parser directives
          used.

          <STRONG>$if</STRONG>  The <STRONG>$if</STRONG> construct allows bindings to be made based on
               the editing mode, the terminal being used, or the
               application using readline.  The text of the test
               extends to the end of the line; no characters are
               required to isolate it.

               <STRONG>mode</STRONG> The <STRONG>mode=</STRONG> form of the <STRONG>$if</STRONG> directive is used to
                    test whether readline is in emacs or vi mode.
                    This may be used in conjunction with the <STRONG>set</STRONG>
                    <STRONG>keymap</STRONG> command, for instance, to set bindings in
                    the <EM>emacs</EM>-<EM>standard</EM> and <EM>emacs</EM>-<EM>ctlx</EM> keymaps only if
                    readline is starting out in emacs mode.

               <STRONG>term</STRONG> The <STRONG>term=</STRONG> form may be used to include terminal-
                    specific key bindings, perhaps to bind the key
                    sequences output by the terminal's function keys.
                    The word on the right side of the <STRONG>=</STRONG> is tested
                    against the full name of the terminal and the
                    portion of the terminal name before the first <STRONG>-</STRONG>.
                    This allows <EM>sun</EM> to match both <EM>sun</EM> and <EM>sun</EM>-<EM>cmd</EM>, for
                    instance.

               <STRONG>application</STRONG>
                    The <STRONG>application</STRONG> construct is used to include
                    application-specific settings.  Each program using
                    the readline library sets the <EM>application</EM> <EM>name</EM>,
                    and an initialization file can test for a
                    particular value.  This could be used to bind key
                    sequences to functions useful for a specific
                    program.  For instance, the following command adds
                    a key sequence that quotes the current or previous
                    word in Bash:
                    <STRONG>$if</STRONG> Bash
                    # Quote the current or previous word
                    "\C-xq": "\eb\"\ef\""
                    <STRONG>$endif</STRONG>

          <STRONG>$endif</STRONG>
               This command, as you saw in the previous example,
               terminates an <STRONG>$if</STRONG> command.

          <STRONG>$else</STRONG>
               Commands in this branch of the <STRONG>$if</STRONG> directive are
               executed if the test fails.

          Readline commands may be given numeric <EM>arguments</EM>, which
          normally act as a repeat count.  Sometimes, however, it is
          the sign of the argument that is significant.  Passing a
          negative argument to a command that acts in the forward
          direction (e.g., <STRONG>kill-line</STRONG>) causes that command to act in a
          backward direction.  Commands whose behavior with arguments
          deviates from this are noted.

          When a command is described as <EM>killing</EM> text, the text
          deleted is saved for possible future retrieval (<EM>yanking)</EM>.
          The killed text is saved in a <EM>kill</EM>-<EM>ring</EM>.  Consecutive kills
          cause the text to be accumulated into one unit, which can be
          yanked all at once. Commands which do not kill text separate
          the chunks of text on the kill-ring.

          The following is a list of the names of the commands and the
          default key sequences to which they are bound.

        <STRONG>Commands</STRONG> <STRONG>for</STRONG> <STRONG>Moving</STRONG>
          <STRONG>beginning-of-line</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-a)</STRONG>
               Move to the start of the current line.
          <STRONG>end-of-line</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-e)</STRONG>
               Move to the end of the line.
          <STRONG>forward-char</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-f)</STRONG>
               Move forward a character.
          <STRONG>backward-char</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-b)</STRONG>
               Move back a character.
          <STRONG>forward-word</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-f)</STRONG>
               Move forward to the end of the next word.  Words are
               composed of alphanumeric characters (letters and
               digits).
          <STRONG>backward-word</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-b)</STRONG>
               Move back to the start of this, or the previous, word.
               Words are composed of alphanumeric characters (letters
               and digits).
          <STRONG>clear-screen</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-l)</STRONG>
               Clear the screen leaving the current line at the top of
               the screen.  With an argument, refresh the current line
               without clearing the screen.
          <STRONG>redraw-current-line</STRONG>
               Refresh the current line.  By default, this is unbound.

        <STRONG>Commands</STRONG> <STRONG>for</STRONG> <STRONG>Manipulating</STRONG> <STRONG>the</STRONG> <STRONG>History</STRONG>
          <STRONG>accept-line</STRONG> <STRONG>(Newline,</STRONG> <STRONG>Return)</STRONG>
               Accept the line regardless of where the cursor is.  If
               this line is non-empty, add it to the history list
               according to the state of the <STRONG>HISTCONTROL</STRONG> variable.  If
               the line is a modified history line, then restore the
               history line to its original state.
          <STRONG>previous-history</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-p)</STRONG>
               Fetch the previous command from the history list,
               moving back in the list.
          <STRONG>next-history</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-n)</STRONG>
               Fetch the next command from the history list, moving
               forward in the list.
          <STRONG>beginning-of-history</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-&lt;)</STRONG>
               Move to the first line in the history.
          <STRONG>end-of-history</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-&gt;)</STRONG>
               Move to the end of the input history, i.e., the line
               currently being entered.
          <STRONG>reverse-search-history</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-r)</STRONG>
               Search backward starting at the current line and moving
               `up' through the history as necessary.  This is an
               incremental search.
          <STRONG>forward-search-history</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-s)</STRONG>
               Search forward starting at the current line and moving
               `down' through the history as necessary.  This is an
               incremental search.
          <STRONG>non-incremental-reverse-search-history</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-p)</STRONG>
               Search backward through the history starting at the
               current line using a non-incremental search for a
               string supplied by the user.
          <STRONG>non-incremental-forward-search-history</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-n)</STRONG>
               Search forward through the history using a
               non-incremental search for a string supplied by the
               user.
          <STRONG>history-search-forward</STRONG>
               Search forward through the history for the string of
               characters between the start of the current line and
               the current point.  This is a non-incremental search.
               By default, this command is unbound.
          <STRONG>history-search-backward</STRONG>
               Search backward through the history for the string of
               characters between the start of the current line and
               the current point.  This is a non-incremental search.
               By default, this command is unbound.
          <STRONG>yank-nth-arg</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-C-y)</STRONG>
               Insert the first argument to the previous command
               (usually the second word on the previous line) at point
               (the current cursor position).  With an argument <STRONG>n</STRONG>,
               insert the <STRONG>n</STRONG>th word from the previous command (the
               words in the previous command begin with word 0).  A
               negative argument inserts the <STRONG>n</STRONG>th word from the end of
               the previous command.
          <STRONG>yank-last-arg</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-.,</STRONG> <STRONG>M-_)</STRONG>
               Insert the last argument to the previous command (the
               last word on the previous line).  With an argument,
               behave exactly like @code{yank-nth-arg}.
          <STRONG>shell-expand-line</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-C-e)</STRONG>
               Expand the line the way the shell does when it reads
               it.  This performs alias and history expansion as well
               as all of the shell word expansions.  See <STRONG>HISTORY</STRONG>
               <STRONG>EXPANSION</STRONG> below for a description of history expansion.
          <STRONG>history-expand-line</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-^)</STRONG>
               Perform history expansion on the current line.  See
               <STRONG>HISTORY</STRONG> <STRONG>EXPANSION</STRONG> below for a description of history
               expansion.
          <STRONG>insert-last-argument</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-.,</STRONG> <STRONG>M-_)</STRONG>
               A synonym for <STRONG>yank-last-arg</STRONG>.
          <STRONG>operate-and-get-next</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-o)</STRONG>
               Accept the current line for execution and fetch the
               next line relative to the current line from the history
               for editing.  Any argument is ignored.

        <STRONG>Commands</STRONG> <STRONG>for</STRONG> <STRONG>Changing</STRONG> <STRONG>Text</STRONG>
          <STRONG>delete-char</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-d)</STRONG>
               Delete the character under the cursor.  If point is at
               the beginning of the line, there are no characters in
               the line, and the last character typed was not <STRONG>C-d</STRONG>,
               then return <STRONG>EOF</STRONG>.
          <STRONG>backward-delete-char</STRONG> <STRONG>(Rubout)</STRONG>
               Delete the character behind the cursor.  When given a
               numeric argument, save the deleted text on the
               kill-ring.
          <STRONG>quoted-insert</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-q,</STRONG> <STRONG>C-v)</STRONG>
               Add the next character that you type to the line
               verbatim.  This is how to insert characters like <STRONG>C-q</STRONG>,
               for example.
          <STRONG>tab-insert</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-v</STRONG> <STRONG>TAB)</STRONG>
               Insert a tab character.
          <STRONG>self-insert</STRONG> <STRONG>(a,</STRONG> <STRONG>b,</STRONG> <STRONG>A,</STRONG> <STRONG>1,</STRONG> <STRONG>!,</STRONG> <STRONG>...)</STRONG>
               Insert the character typed.
          <STRONG>transpose-chars</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-t)</STRONG>
               Drag the character before point forward over the
               character at point.  Point moves forward as well.  If
               point is at the end of the line, then transpose the two
               characters before point.  Negative arguments don't
               work.
          <STRONG>transpose-words</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-t)</STRONG>
               Drag the word behind the cursor past the word in front
               of the cursor moving the cursor over that word as well.
          <STRONG>upcase-word</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-u)</STRONG>
               Uppercase the current (or following) word.  With a
               negative argument, do the previous word, but do not
               move point.
          <STRONG>downcase-word</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-l)</STRONG>
               Lowercase the current (or following) word.  With a
               negative argument, do the previous word, but do not
               move point.
          <STRONG>capitalize-word</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-c)</STRONG>
               Capitalize the current (or following) word.  With a
               negative argument, do the previous word, but do not
               move point.

        <STRONG>Killing</STRONG> <STRONG>and</STRONG> <STRONG>Yanking</STRONG>
          <STRONG>kill-line</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-k)</STRONG>
               Kill the text from the current cursor position to the
               end of the line.
          <STRONG>backward-kill-line</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-x</STRONG> <STRONG>C-Rubout)</STRONG>
               Kill backward to the beginning of the line.
          <STRONG>unix-line-discard</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-u)</STRONG>
               Kill backward from point to the beginning of the line.
          <STRONG>kill-whole-line</STRONG>
               Kill all characters on the current line, no matter
               where the cursor is.  By default, this is unbound.
          <STRONG>kill-word</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-d)</STRONG>
               Kill from the cursor to the end of the current word, or
               if between words, to the end of the next word.  Word
               boundaries are the same as those used by <STRONG>forward-word</STRONG>.
          <STRONG>backward-kill-word</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-Rubout)</STRONG>
               Kill the word behind the cursor.  Word boundaries are
               the same as those used by <STRONG>backward-word</STRONG>.
          <STRONG>unix-word-rubout</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-w)</STRONG>
               Kill the word behind the cursor, using white space as a
               word boundary.  The word boundaries are different from
               backward-kill-word.
          <STRONG>delete-horizontal-space</STRONG>
               Delete all spaces and tabs around point.  By default,
               this is unbound.
          <STRONG>yank</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-y)</STRONG>
               Yank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at the
               cursor.
          <STRONG>yank-pop</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-y)</STRONG>
               Rotate the kill-ring, and yank the new top.  Only works
               following <STRONG>yank</STRONG> or <STRONG>yank-pop</STRONG>.

        <STRONG>Numeric</STRONG> <STRONG>Arguments</STRONG>
          <STRONG>digit-argument</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-0,</STRONG> <STRONG>M-1,</STRONG> <STRONG>...,</STRONG> <STRONG>M--)</STRONG>
               Add this digit to the argument already accumulating, or
               start a new argument.  M-- starts a negative argument.
          <STRONG>universal-argument</STRONG>
               Each time this is executed, the argument count is
               multiplied by four.  The argument count is initially
               one, so executing this function the first time makes
               the argument count four.  By default, this is not bound
               to a key.

        <STRONG>Completing</STRONG>
          <STRONG>complete</STRONG> <STRONG>(TAB)</STRONG>
               Attempt to perform completion on the text before point.
               <STRONG>Bash</STRONG> attempts completion treating the text as a
               variable (if the text begins with <STRONG>$</STRONG>), username (if the
               text begins with <STRONG>~</STRONG>), hostname (if the text begins with
               <STRONG>@</STRONG>), or command (including aliases and functions) in
               turn.  If none of these produces a match, filename
               completion is attempted.
          <STRONG>possible-completions</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-?)</STRONG>
               List the possible completions of the text before point.
          <STRONG>insert-completions</STRONG>
               Insert all completions of the text before point that
               would have been generated by <STRONG>possible-completions</STRONG>.  By
               default, this is not bound to a key.
          <STRONG>complete-filename</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-/)</STRONG>
               Attempt filename completion on the text before point.
          <STRONG>possible-filename-completions</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-x</STRONG> <STRONG>/)</STRONG>
               List the possible completions of the text before point,
               treating it as a filename.

               Attempt completion on the text before point, treating
               it as a username.
          <STRONG>possible-username-completions</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-x</STRONG> <STRONG>~)</STRONG>
               List the possible completions of the text before point,
               treating it as a username.
          <STRONG>complete-variable</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-$)</STRONG>
               Attempt completion on the text before point, treating
               it as a shell variable.
          <STRONG>possible-variable-completions</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-x</STRONG> <STRONG>$)</STRONG>
               List the possible completions of the text before point,
               treating it as a shell variable.
          <STRONG>complete-hostname</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-@)</STRONG>
               Attempt completion on the text before point, treating
               it as a hostname.
          <STRONG>possible-hostname-completions</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-x</STRONG> <STRONG>@)</STRONG>
               List the possible completions of the text before point,

          <STRONG>complete-command</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-!)</STRONG>
               Attempt completion on the text before point, treating
               it as a command name.  Command completion attempts to
               match the text against aliases, reserved words, shell
               functions, builtins, and finally executable filenames,
               in that order.
          <STRONG>possible-command-completions</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-x</STRONG> <STRONG>!)</STRONG>
               List the possible completions of the text before point,
               treating it as a command name.
          <STRONG>dynamic-complete-history</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-TAB)</STRONG>
               Attempt completion on the text before point, comparing
               the text against lines from the history list for
               possible completion matches.
          <STRONG>complete-into-braces</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-{)</STRONG>
               Perform filename completion and return the list of
               possible completions enclosed within braces so the list
               is available to the shell (see <STRONG>Brace</STRONG> <STRONG>Expansion</STRONG> above).

        <STRONG>Keyboard</STRONG> <STRONG>Macros</STRONG>
          <STRONG>start-kbd-macro</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-x</STRONG> <STRONG>()</STRONG>
               Begin saving the characters typed into the current
               keyboard macro.
          <STRONG>end-kbd-macro</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-x</STRONG> <STRONG>))</STRONG>
               Stop saving the characters typed into the current
               keyboard macro and save the definition.
          <STRONG>call-last-kbd-macro</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-x</STRONG> <STRONG>e)</STRONG>
               Re-execute the last keyboard macro defined, by making
               the characters in the macro appear as if typed at the
               keyboard.

        <STRONG>Miscellaneous</STRONG>
          <STRONG>re-read-init-file</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-x</STRONG> <STRONG>C-r)</STRONG>
               Read in the contents of your init file, and incorporate
               any bindings or variable assignments found there.
          <STRONG>abort</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-g)</STRONG>
               Abort the current editing command and ring the
               terminal's bell (subject to the setting of <STRONG>bell-style</STRONG>).
          <STRONG>do-uppercase-version</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-a,</STRONG> <STRONG>M-b,</STRONG> <STRONG>...)</STRONG>
               Run the command that is bound to the corresponding
               uppercase character.
          <STRONG>prefix-meta</STRONG> <STRONG>(ESC)</STRONG>
               Metafy the next character typed.  <STRONG>ESC</STRONG> <STRONG>f</STRONG> is equivalent
               to <STRONG>Meta-f</STRONG>.
          <STRONG>undo</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-_,</STRONG> <STRONG>C-x</STRONG> <STRONG>C-u)</STRONG>
               Incremental undo, separately remembered for each line.
          <STRONG>revert-line</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-r)</STRONG>
               Undo all changes made to this line.  This is like
               typing the <STRONG>undo</STRONG> command enough times to return the line
               to its initial state.
          <STRONG>tilde-expand</STRONG> <STRONG>(M-~)</STRONG>
               Perform tilde expansion on the current word.
          <STRONG>dump-functions</STRONG>
               Print all of the functions and their key bindings to
               the readline output stream.  If a numeric argument is
               supplied, the output is formatted in such a way that it
               can be made part of an <EM>inputrc</EM> file.
          <STRONG>display-shell-version</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-x</STRONG> <STRONG>C-v)</STRONG>
               Display version information about the current instance
               of <STRONG>bash</STRONG>.
          <STRONG>emacs-editing-mode</STRONG> <STRONG>(C-e)</STRONG>
               When in <STRONG>vi</STRONG> editing mode, this causes a switch to <STRONG>emacs</STRONG>
               editing mode.

     <STRONG>HISTORY</STRONG>
          When interactive, the shell provides access to the <EM>command</EM>
          <EM>history</EM>, the list of commands previously typed.  The text of
          the last <STRONG>HISTSIZE</STRONG> commands (default 500) is saved in a
          history list.  The shell stores each command in the history
          list prior to parameter and variable expansion (see
          <STRONG>EXPANSION</STRONG> above) but after history expansion is performed,
          subject to the values of the shell variables
          <STRONG>command_oriented_history</STRONG> and <STRONG>HISTCONTROL</STRONG>.  On startup, the
          history is initialized from the file named by the variable
          <STRONG>HISTFILE</STRONG> (default ~/.<EM>bash_history)</EM>.  <STRONG>HISTFILE</STRONG> is truncated,
          if necessary, to contain no more than <STRONG>HISTFILESIZE</STRONG> lines.
          The builtin command <STRONG>fc</STRONG> (see <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG> <STRONG>BUILTIN</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG> below)
          may be used to list or edit and re-execute a portion of the
          history list.  The <STRONG>history</STRONG> builtin can be used to display
          the history list and manipulate the history file.  When
          using the command-line editing, search commands are
          available in each editing mode that provide access to the
          history list.  When an interactive shell exits, the last
          <STRONG>HISTSIZE</STRONG> lines are copied from the history list to <STRONG>HISTFILE</STRONG>.
          If <STRONG>HISTFILE</STRONG> is unset, or if the history file is unwritable,
          the history is not saved.

     <STRONG>HISTORY</STRONG> <STRONG>EXPANSION</STRONG>
          The shell supports a history expansion feature that is
          similar to the history expansion in <STRONG>csh.</STRONG>  This section
          describes what syntax features are available.  This feature
          is enabled by default for interactive shells, and can be
          disabled using the <STRONG>+H</STRONG> option to the <STRONG>set</STRONG> builtin command (see
          <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG> <STRONG>BUILTIN</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG> below).  Non-interactive shells do
          not perform history expansion.

          History expansion is performed immediately after a complete
          line is read, before the shell breaks it into words.  It
          takes place in two parts.  The first is to determine which
          line from the previous history to use during substitution.
          The second is to select portions of that line for inclusion
          into the current one.  The line selected from the previous
          history is the <EM>event</EM>, and the portions of that line that are
          acted upon are <EM>words</EM>.  The line is broken into words in the
          same fashion as when reading input, so that several
          <EM>metacharacter</EM>-separated words surrounded by quotes are
          considered as one word.  Only backslash (<STRONG>\</STRONG>) and single
          quotes can quote the history escape character, which is <STRONG>!</STRONG> by
          default.

          The shell allows control of the various characters used by
          the history expansion mechanism (see the description of
          <STRONG>histchars</STRONG> above under <STRONG>Shell</STRONG> <STRONG>Variables</STRONG>).

        <STRONG>Event</STRONG> <STRONG>Designators</STRONG>
          An event designator is a reference to a command line entry
          in the history list.

          <STRONG>!</STRONG>    Start a history substitution, except when followed by a
               <STRONG>blank</STRONG>, newline, = or (.

<H2>9          ^8string19^8string29^</H2><PRE>
8               Quick substitution.  Repeat the last command, replacing
               <EM>string1</EM> with <EM>string2</EM>.  Equivalent to
               ``!!:s/<EM>string1</EM>/<EM>string2</EM>/'' (see <STRONG>Modifiers</STRONG> below).
          <STRONG>!#</STRONG>   The entire command line typed so far.

        <STRONG>Word</STRONG> <STRONG>Designators</STRONG>
          A <STRONG>:</STRONG> separates the event specification from the word
          designator.  It can be omitted if the word designator begins
          with a <STRONG>^</STRONG>, <STRONG>$</STRONG>, <STRONG>*</STRONG>, or <STRONG>%</STRONG>.  Words are numbered from the beginning
          of the line, with the first word being denoted by a 0
          (zero).

          <STRONG>0</STRONG> <STRONG>(zero)</STRONG>
               The zeroth word.  For the shell, this is the command
               word.
          <STRONG>n</STRONG>    The <STRONG>n</STRONG>th word.
          <STRONG>^</STRONG>    The first argument.  That is, word 1.
          <STRONG>$</STRONG>    The last argument.
          <STRONG>%</STRONG>    The word matched by the most recent `?<EM>string</EM>?' search.
          <STRONG>x-y</STRONG>  A range of words; `-<STRONG>y</STRONG>' abbreviates `0-<STRONG>y</STRONG>'.
          <STRONG>*</STRONG>    All of the words but the zeroth.  This is a synonym for
               `<STRONG>1</STRONG>-$'.  It is not an error to use <STRONG>*</STRONG> if there is just
               one word in the event; the empty string is returned in
               that case.
          <STRONG>x*</STRONG>   Abbreviates <STRONG>x</STRONG>-$.
          <STRONG>x-</STRONG>   Abbreviates <STRONG>x</STRONG>-$ like <STRONG>x*</STRONG>, but omits the last word.

        <STRONG>Modifiers</STRONG>
          After the optional word designator, you can add a sequence
          of one or more of the following modifiers, each preceded by
          a `:'.

          <STRONG>h</STRONG>    Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving only the
               head.
          <STRONG>r</STRONG>    Remove a trailing suffix of the form .<EM>xxx</EM>, leaving the
               basename.
          <STRONG>e</STRONG>    Remove all but the trailing suffix.
          <STRONG>t</STRONG>    Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the
               tail.
          <STRONG>p</STRONG>    Print the new command but do not execute it.
          <STRONG>q</STRONG>    Quote the substituted words, escaping further
               substitutions.

          <STRONG>x</STRONG>    Quote the substituted words as with <STRONG>q</STRONG>, but break into
               words at <STRONG>blanks</STRONG> and newlines.
          <STRONG>s/</STRONG><EM>old</EM><STRONG>/</STRONG><EM>new</EM><STRONG>/</STRONG>
               Substitute <EM>new</EM> for the first occurrence of <EM>old</EM> in the
               event line.  Any delimiter can be used in place of /.
               The final delimiter is optional if it is the last
               character of the event line.  The delimiter may be
               quoted in <EM>old</EM> and <EM>new</EM> with a single backslash.  If &amp;
               appears in <EM>new</EM>, it is replaced by <EM>old</EM>.  A single
               backslash will quote the &amp;.
          <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>    Repeat the previous substitution.
          <STRONG>g</STRONG>    Cause changes to be applied over the entire event line.
               This is used in conjunction with `<STRONG>:s</STRONG>' (e.g.,
               `<STRONG>:gs/</STRONG><EM>old</EM><STRONG>/</STRONG><EM>new</EM><STRONG>/</STRONG>') or `<STRONG>:&amp;</STRONG>'.  If used with `<STRONG>:s</STRONG>', any
               delimiter can be used in place of /, and the final
               delimiter is optional if it is the last character of
               the event line.

     <STRONG>ARITHMETIC</STRONG> <STRONG>EVALUATION</STRONG>
          The shell allows arithmetic expressions to be evaluated,
          under certain circumstances (see the <STRONG>let</STRONG> builtin command and
          <STRONG>Arithmetic</STRONG> <STRONG>Expansion</STRONG>).  Evaluation is done in long integers
          with no check for overflow, though division by 0 is trapped
          and flagged as an error.  The following list of operators is
          grouped into levels of equal-precedence operators.  The
          levels are listed in order of decreasing precedence.

          <STRONG>-</STRONG> <STRONG>+</STRONG>  unary minus and plus
          <STRONG>!</STRONG> <STRONG>~</STRONG>  logical and bitwise negation
          <STRONG>*</STRONG> <STRONG>/</STRONG> <STRONG>%</STRONG>
               multiplication, division, remainder
          <STRONG>+</STRONG> <STRONG>-</STRONG>  addition, subtraction
          <STRONG>&lt;&lt;</STRONG> <STRONG>&gt;&gt;</STRONG>
               left and right bitwise shifts
          <STRONG>&lt;=</STRONG> <STRONG>&gt;=</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;</STRONG> <STRONG>&gt;</STRONG>
               comparison
          <STRONG>==</STRONG> <STRONG>!=</STRONG>
               equality and inequality
          <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>    bitwise AND
          <STRONG>^</STRONG>    bitwise exclusive OR
          <STRONG>|</STRONG>    bitwise OR
          <STRONG>&amp;&amp;</STRONG>   logical AND
          <STRONG>||</STRONG>   logical OR
          <STRONG>=</STRONG> <STRONG>*=</STRONG> <STRONG>/=</STRONG> <STRONG>%=</STRONG> <STRONG>+=</STRONG> <STRONG>-=</STRONG>
               assignment

          Shell variables are allowed as operands; parameter expansion
          is performed before the expression is evaluated. The value
          of a parameter is coerced to a long integer within an
          expression.  A shell variable need not have its integer
          attribute turned on to be used in an expression.

          Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted as octal numbers.
          A leading <EM>0x</EM> or <EM>0X</EM> denotes hexadecimal.  Otherwise, numbers
          take the form [<EM>base</EM>#]n, where <EM>base</EM> is a decimal number
          between 2 and 36 representing the arithmetic base, and <STRONG>n</STRONG> is
          a number in that base.  If <EM>base</EM> is omitted, then base 10 is
          used.

          Operators are evaluated in order of precedence.  Sub-
          expressions in parentheses are evaluated first and may
          override the precedence rules above.

     <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG> <STRONG>BUILTIN</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG>
          <STRONG>:</STRONG> [<EM>arguments</EM>]
               No effect; the command does nothing beyond expanding
               <EM>arguments</EM> and performing any specified redirections.  A
               zero exit code is returned.

           <STRONG>.</STRONG>  <EM>filename</EM> [<EM>arguments</EM>]
          <STRONG>source</STRONG> <EM>filename</EM> [<EM>arguments</EM>]
               Read and execute commands from <EM>filename</EM> in the current
               shell environment and return the exit status of the
               last command executed from <EM>filename</EM>.  If <EM>filename</EM> does
               not contain a slash, pathnames in <STRONG>PATH</STRONG> are used to find
               the directory containing <EM>filename</EM>.  The file searched
               for in <STRONG>PATH</STRONG> need not be executable.  The current
               directory is searched if no file is found in <STRONG>PATH</STRONG>.  If
               any <EM>arguments</EM> are supplied, they become the positional
               parameters when <EM>file</EM> is executed.  Otherwise the
               positional parameters are unchanged.  The return status
               is the status of the last command exited within the
               script (0 if no commands are executed), and false if
               <EM>filename</EM> is not found.

          <STRONG>alias</STRONG> [<EM>name</EM>[=<EM>value</EM>] ...]
               <STRONG>Alias</STRONG> with no arguments prints the list of aliases in
               the form <EM>name</EM>=<EM>value</EM> on standard output.  When arguments
               are supplied, an alias is defined for each <EM>name</EM> whose
               <EM>value</EM> is given.  A trailing space in <EM>value</EM> causes the
               next word to be checked for alias substitution when the
               alias is expanded.  For each <EM>name</EM> in the argument list
               for which no <EM>value</EM> is supplied, the name and value of
               the alias is printed.  <STRONG>Alias</STRONG> returns true unless a <EM>name</EM>
               is given for which no alias has been defined.

          <STRONG>bg</STRONG> [<EM>jobspec</EM>]
               Place <EM>jobspec</EM> in the background, as if it had been
               started with <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>.  If <EM>jobspec</EM> is not present, the shell's
               notion of the <EM>current</EM> <EM>job</EM> is used.  <STRONG>bg</STRONG> <EM>jobspec</EM> returns
               0 unless run when job control is disabled or, when run
               with job control enabled, if <EM>jobspec</EM> was not found or
               started without job control.

          <STRONG>bind</STRONG> [<STRONG>-m</STRONG> <EM>keymap</EM>] [<STRONG>-lvd</STRONG>] [<STRONG>-q</STRONG> <EM>name</EM>]
          <STRONG>bind</STRONG> [<STRONG>-m</STRONG> <EM>keymap</EM>] <STRONG>-f</STRONG> <EM>filename</EM>
          <STRONG>bind</STRONG> [<STRONG>-m</STRONG> <EM>keymap</EM>] <EM>keyseq</EM>:<EM>function</EM>-<EM>name</EM>
               Display current <STRONG>readline</STRONG> key and function bindings, or
               bind a key sequence to a <STRONG>readline</STRONG> function or macro.
               The binding syntax accepted is identical to that of
               .<EM>inputrc</EM>, but each binding must be passed as a separate
               argument; e.g., '"\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file'.
               Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
               <STRONG>-m</STRONG> <EM>keymap</EM>
                    Use <EM>keymap</EM> as the keymap to be affected by the
                    subsequent bindings.  Acceptable <EM>keymap</EM> names are
                    <EM>emacs</EM>, <EM>emacs</EM>-<EM>standard</EM>, <EM>emacs</EM>-<EM>meta</EM>, <EM>emacs</EM>-<EM>ctlx</EM>, <EM>vi</EM>,
                    <EM>vi</EM>-<EM>move</EM>, <EM>vi</EM>-<EM>command</EM>, and <EM>vi</EM>-<EM>insert</EM>.  <EM>vi</EM> is
                    equivalent to <EM>vi</EM>-<EM>command</EM>; <EM>emacs</EM> is equivalent to
                    <EM>emacs</EM>-<EM>standard</EM>.
               <STRONG>-l</STRONG>   List the names of all <STRONG>readline</STRONG> functions
               <STRONG>-v</STRONG>   List current function names and bindings
               <STRONG>-d</STRONG>   Dump function names and bindings in such a way
                    that they can be re-read
               <STRONG>-f</STRONG> <EM>filename</EM>
                    Read key bindings from <EM>filename</EM>
               <STRONG>-q</STRONG> <EM>function</EM>
                    Query about which keys invoke the named <EM>function</EM>

               The return value is 0 unless an unrecognized option is
               given or an error occurred.

          <STRONG>break</STRONG> [<STRONG>n</STRONG>]
               Exit from within a <STRONG>for</STRONG>, <STRONG>while</STRONG>, or <STRONG>until</STRONG> loop.  If <STRONG>n</STRONG> is
               specified, break <STRONG>n</STRONG> levels.  <STRONG>n</STRONG> must be <STRONG>_</STRONG> 1.  If <STRONG>n</STRONG> is
               greater than the number of enclosing loops, all
               enclosing loops are exited.  The return value is 0
               unless the shell is not executing a loop when <STRONG>break</STRONG> is
               executed.

          <STRONG>builtin</STRONG> <EM>shell</EM>-<EM>builtin</EM> [<EM>arguments</EM>]
               Execute the specified shell builtin, passing it
               <EM>arguments</EM>, and return its exit status.  This is useful
               when you wish to define a function whose name is the
               same as a shell builtin, but need the functionality of
               the builtin within the function itself.  The <STRONG>cd</STRONG> builtin
               is commonly redefined this way.  The return status is
               false if <EM>shell</EM>-<EM>builtin</EM> is not a shell builtin command.

          <STRONG>cd</STRONG> [<EM>dir</EM>]
               Change the current directory to <EM>dir</EM>.  The variable <STRONG>HOME</STRONG>
               is the default <EM>dir</EM>.  The variable <STRONG>CDPATH</STRONG> defines the
               search path for the directory containing <EM>dir</EM>.
               Alternative directory names are separated by a colon
               (:).  A null directory name in <STRONG>CDPATH</STRONG> is the same as
               the current directory, i.e., ``<STRONG>.</STRONG>''.  If <EM>dir</EM> begins with
               a slash (/), then <STRONG>CDPATH</STRONG> is not used.  An argument of <STRONG>-</STRONG>
               is equivalent to <STRONG>$OLDPWD</STRONG>.  The return value is true if
               the directory was successfully changed; false
               otherwise.

          <STRONG>command</STRONG> [<STRONG>-pVv</STRONG>] <EM>command</EM> [<EM>arg</EM> ...]
               Run <EM>command</EM> with <EM>args</EM> suppressing the normal shell
               function lookup. Only builtin commands or commands
               found in the <STRONG>PATH</STRONG> are executed.  If the <STRONG>-p</STRONG> option is
               given, the search for <EM>command</EM> is performed using a
               default value for <STRONG>PATH</STRONG> that is guaranteed to find all
               of the standard utilities.  If either the <STRONG>-V</STRONG> or <STRONG>-v</STRONG>
               option is supplied, a description of <EM>command</EM> is
               printed.  The <STRONG>-v</STRONG> option causes a single word indicating
               the command or pathname used to invoke <EM>command</EM> to be
               printed; the <STRONG>-V</STRONG> option produces a more verbose
               description.  An argument of <STRONG>--</STRONG> disables option
               checking for the rest of the arguments.  If the <STRONG>-V</STRONG> or
               <STRONG>-v</STRONG> option is supplied, the exit status is 0 if <EM>command</EM>
               was found, and 1 if not.  If neither option is supplied
               and an error occurred or <EM>command</EM> cannot be found, the
               exit status is 127.  Otherwise, the exit status of the
               <STRONG>command</STRONG> builtin is the exit status of <EM>command</EM>.

          <STRONG>continue</STRONG> [<STRONG>n</STRONG>]
               Resume the next iteration of the enclosing <STRONG>for</STRONG>, <STRONG>while</STRONG>,
               or <STRONG>until</STRONG> loop.  If <STRONG>n</STRONG> is specified, resume at the <STRONG>n</STRONG>th
               enclosing loop.  <STRONG>n</STRONG> must be <STRONG>_</STRONG> 1.  If <STRONG>n</STRONG> is greater than
               the number of enclosing loops, the last enclosing loop
               (the `top-level' loop) is resumed.  The return value is
               0 unless the shell is not executing a loop when
               <STRONG>continue</STRONG> is executed.

          <STRONG>declare</STRONG> [<STRONG>-frxi</STRONG>] [<EM>name</EM>[=<EM>value</EM>]]
          <STRONG>typeset</STRONG> [<STRONG>-frxi</STRONG>] [<EM>name</EM>[=<EM>value</EM>]]
               Declare variables and/or give them attributes.  If no
               <EM>name</EM>s are given, then display the values of variables
               instead.  The options can be used to restrict output to
               variables with the specified attribute.
               <STRONG>-f</STRONG>   Use function names only
               <STRONG>-r</STRONG>   Make <EM>name</EM>s readonly.  These names cannot then be
                    assigned values by subsequent assignment
                    statements.
               <STRONG>-x</STRONG>   Mark <EM>name</EM>s for export to subsequent commands via
                    the environment.
               <STRONG>-i</STRONG>   The variable is treated as an integer; arithmetic
                    evaluation (see <STRONG>ARITHMETIC</STRONG> <STRONG>EVALUATION</STRONG> <STRONG>)</STRONG> is
                    performed when the variable is assigned a value.

               Using `+' instead of `-' turns off the attribute
               instead.  When used in a function, makes <EM>name</EM>s local,
               as with the <STRONG>local</STRONG> command.  The return value is 0
               unless an illegal option is encountered, an attempt is
               made to define a function using "-f foo=bar", one of
               the <EM>names</EM> is not a legal shell variable name, an
               attempt is made to turn off readonly status for a
               readonly variable, or an attempt is made to display a
               non-existant function with -f.

          <STRONG>dirs</STRONG> <STRONG>[-l]</STRONG> <STRONG>[+/-n]</STRONG>
               Display the list of currently remembered directories.
               Directories are added to the list with the <STRONG>pushd</STRONG>
               command; the <STRONG>popd</STRONG> command moves back up through the
               list.
               <STRONG>+n</STRONG>   displays the <STRONG>n</STRONG>th entry counting from the left of
                    the list shown by <STRONG>dirs</STRONG> when invoked without
                    options, starting with zero.
               <STRONG>-n</STRONG>   displays the <STRONG>n</STRONG>th entry counting from the right of
                    the list shown by <STRONG>dirs</STRONG> when invoked without
                    options, starting with zero.
               <STRONG>-l</STRONG>   produces a longer listing; the default listing
                    format uses a tilde to denote the home directory.

               The return value is 0 unless an illegal option is
               supplied or <STRONG>n</STRONG> indexes beyond the end of the directory
               stack.

          <STRONG>echo</STRONG> [<STRONG>-neE</STRONG>] [<EM>arg</EM> ...]
               Output the <EM>arg</EM>s, separated by spaces.  The return
               status is always 0.  If <STRONG>-n</STRONG> is specified, the trailing
               newline is suppressed.  If the <STRONG>-e</STRONG> option is given,
               interpretation of the following backslash-escaped
               characters is enabled.  The <STRONG>-E</STRONG> option disables the
               interpretation of these escape characters, even on
               systems where they are interpreted by default.
               <STRONG>\a</STRONG>   alert (bell)
               <STRONG>\b</STRONG>   backspace
               <STRONG>\c</STRONG>   suppress trailing newline
               <STRONG>\f</STRONG>   form feed
               <STRONG>\n</STRONG>   new line
               <STRONG>\r</STRONG>   carriage return
               <STRONG>\t</STRONG>   horizontal tab
               <STRONG>\v</STRONG>   vertical tab
               <STRONG>\\</STRONG>   backslash
               <STRONG>\nnn</STRONG> the character whose ASCII code is <EM>nnn</EM> (octal)

          <STRONG>enable</STRONG> [<STRONG>-n</STRONG>] [<STRONG>-all</STRONG>] [<EM>name</EM> ...]
               Enable and disable builtin shell commands.  This allows
               the execution of a disk command which has the same name
               as a shell builtin without specifying a full pathname.
               If <STRONG>-n</STRONG> is used, each <EM>name</EM> is disabled; otherwise, <EM>names</EM>
               are enabled.  For example, to use the <STRONG>test</STRONG> binary found
               via the <STRONG>PATH</STRONG> instead of the shell builtin version, type
               ``enable -n test''.  If no arguments are given, a list
               of all enabled shell builtins is printed.  If only <STRONG>-n</STRONG>
               is supplied, a list of all disabled builtins is
               printed.  If only <STRONG>-all</STRONG> is supplied, the list printed
               includes all builtins, with an indication of whether or
               not each is enabled.  <STRONG>enable</STRONG> accepts <STRONG>-a</STRONG> as a synonym
               for <STRONG>-all</STRONG>.  The return value is 0 unless a <EM>name</EM> is not a
               shell builtin.

          <STRONG>eval</STRONG> [<EM>arg</EM> ...]
               The <EM>arg</EM>s are read and concatenated together into a
               single command.  This command is then read and executed
               by the shell, and its exit status is returned as the
               value of the <STRONG>eval</STRONG> command.  If there are no <EM>args</EM>, or
               only null arguments, <STRONG>eval</STRONG> returns true.

          <STRONG>exec</STRONG> [[<STRONG>-</STRONG>] <EM>command</EM> [<EM>arguments</EM>]]
               If <EM>command</EM> is specified, it replaces the shell.  No new
               process is created.  The <EM>arguments</EM> become the arguments
               to <EM>command</EM>.  If the first argument is <STRONG>-</STRONG>, the shell
               places a dash in the zeroth arg passed to <EM>command</EM>.
               This is what login does.  If the file cannot be
               executed for some reason, a non-interactive shell
               exits, unless the shell variable <STRONG>no_exit_on_failed_exec</STRONG>
               exists, in which case it returns failure.  An
               interactive shell returns failure if the file cannot be
               executed.  If <EM>command</EM> is not specified, any
               redirections take effect in the current shell, and the
               return status is 0.

          <STRONG>exit</STRONG> [<STRONG>n</STRONG>]
               Cause the shell to exit with a status of <STRONG>n</STRONG>.  If <STRONG>n</STRONG> is
               omitted, the exit status is that of the last command
               executed.  A trap on <STRONG>EXIT</STRONG> is executed before the shell
               terminates.

          <STRONG>export</STRONG> [<STRONG>-nf</STRONG>] [<EM>name</EM>[=<EM>word</EM>]] ...
          <STRONG>export</STRONG> <STRONG>-p</STRONG>
               The supplied <EM>names</EM> are marked for automatic export to
               the environment of subsequently executed commands.  If
               the <STRONG>-f</STRONG> option is given, the <EM>names</EM> refer to functions.
               If no <EM>names</EM> are given, or if the <STRONG>-p</STRONG> option is supplied,
               a list of all names that are exported in this shell is
               printed.  The <STRONG>-n</STRONG> option causes the export property to
               be removed from the named variables.  An argument of <STRONG>--</STRONG>
               disables option checking for the rest of the arguments.
               <STRONG>export</STRONG> returns an exit status of 0 unless an illegal
               option is encountered, one of the <EM>names</EM> is not a legal
               shell variable name, or <STRONG>-f</STRONG> is supplied with a <EM>name</EM> that
               is not a function.

          <STRONG>fc</STRONG> [<STRONG>-e</STRONG> <EM>ename</EM>] [<STRONG>-nlr</STRONG>] [<EM>first</EM>] [<EM>last</EM>]
          <STRONG>fc</STRONG> <STRONG>-s</STRONG> [<EM>pat</EM>=<EM>rep</EM>] [<EM>cmd</EM>]
               Fix Command.  In the first form, a range of commands
               from <EM>first</EM> to <EM>last</EM> is selected from the history list.
               <EM>First</EM> and <EM>last</EM> may be specified as a string (to locate
               the last command beginning with that string) or as a
               number (an index into the history list, where a
               negative number is used as an offset from the current
               command number).  If <EM>last</EM> is not specified it is set to
               the current command for listing (so that <STRONG>fc</STRONG> <STRONG>-l</STRONG> <STRONG>-10</STRONG>
               prints the last 10 commands) and to <EM>first</EM> otherwise.
               If <EM>first</EM> is not specified it is set to the previous
               command for editing and -16 for listing.

               The <STRONG>-n</STRONG> flag suppresses the command numbers when
               listing.  The <STRONG>-r</STRONG> flag reverses the order of the
               commands.  If the <STRONG>-l</STRONG> flag is given, the commands are
               listed on standard output.  Otherwise, the editor given
               by <EM>ename</EM> is invoked on a file containing those
               commands.  If <EM>ename</EM> is not given, the value of the
               <STRONG>FCEDIT</STRONG> variable is used, and the value of <STRONG>EDITOR</STRONG> if
               <STRONG>FCEDIT</STRONG> is not set.  If neither variable is set, <EM>vi</EM> is
               used.  When editing is complete, the edited commands
               are echoed and executed.

               In the second form, <EM>command</EM> is re-executed after each
               instance of <EM>pat</EM> is replaced by <EM>rep</EM>.  A useful alias to
               use with this is ``r=fc -s'', so that typing ``r cc''
               runs the last command beginning with ``cc'' and typing
               ``r'' re-executes the last command.

               If the first form is used, the return value is 0 unless
               an illegal option is encountered or <EM>first</EM> or <EM>last</EM>
               specify history lines out of range.  If the <STRONG>-e</STRONG> option
               is supplied, the return value is the value of the last
               command executed or failure if an error occurs with the
               temporary file of commands.  If the second form is
               used, the return status is that of the command re-
               executed, unless <EM>cmd</EM> does not specify a valid history
               line, in which case <STRONG>fc</STRONG> returns failure.

          <STRONG>fg</STRONG> [<EM>jobspec</EM>]
               Place <EM>jobspec</EM> in the foreground, and make it the
               current job.  If <EM>jobspec</EM> is not present, the shell's
               notion of the <EM>current</EM> <EM>job</EM> is used.  The return value is
               that of the command placed into the foreground, or
               failure if run when job control is disabled or, when
               run with job control enabled, if <EM>jobspec</EM> does not
               specify a valid job or <EM>jobspec</EM> specifies a job that was
               started without job control.

          <STRONG>getopts</STRONG> <EM>optstring</EM> <EM>name</EM> [<EM>args</EM>]
               <STRONG>getopts</STRONG> is used by shell procedures to parse positional
               parameters.  <EM>optstring</EM> contains the option letters to
               be recognized; if a letter is followed by a colon, the
               option is expected to have an argument, which should be
               separated from it by white space.  Each time it is
               invoked, <STRONG>getopts</STRONG> places the next option in the shell
               variable <EM>name</EM>, initializing <EM>name</EM> if it does not exist,
               and the index of the next argument to be processed into
               the variable <STRONG>OPTIND</STRONG>.  <STRONG>OPTIND</STRONG> is initialized to 1 each
               time the shell or a shell script is invoked.  When an
               option requires an argument, <STRONG>getopts</STRONG> places that
               argument into the variable <STRONG>OPTARG</STRONG>.  The shell does not
               reset <STRONG>OPTIND</STRONG> automatically; it must be manually reset
               between multiple calls to <STRONG>getopts</STRONG> within the same shell
               invocation if a new set of parameters is to be used.

               <STRONG>getopts</STRONG> can report errors in two ways.  If the first
               character of <EM>optstring</EM> is a colon, <EM>silent</EM> error
               reporting is used.  In normal operation diagnostic
               messages are printed when illegal options or missing
               option arguments are encountered.  If the variable
               <STRONG>OPTERR</STRONG> is set to 0, no error message will be displayed,
               even if the first character of <EM>optstring</EM> is not a
               colon.

               If an illegal option is seen, <STRONG>getopts</STRONG> places ? into
               <EM>name</EM> and, if not silent, prints an error message and
               unsets <STRONG>OPTARG</STRONG>.  If <STRONG>getopts</STRONG> is silent, the option
               character found is placed in <STRONG>OPTARG</STRONG> and no diagnostic
               message is printed.

               If a required argument is not found, and <STRONG>getopts</STRONG> is not
               silent, a question mark (<STRONG>?</STRONG>) is placed in <EM>name</EM>, <STRONG>OPTARG</STRONG>
               is unset, and a diagnostic message is printed.  If
               <STRONG>getopts</STRONG> is silent, then a colon (<STRONG>:</STRONG>) is placed in <EM>name</EM>
               and <STRONG>OPTARG</STRONG> is set to the option character found.

               <STRONG>getopts</STRONG> normally parses the positional parameters, but
               if more arguments are given in <EM>args</EM>, <STRONG>getopts</STRONG> parses
               those instead.  <STRONG>getopts</STRONG> returns true if an option,
               specified or unspecified, is found.  It returns false
               if the end of options is encountered or an error
               occurs.

          <STRONG>hash</STRONG> [<STRONG>-r</STRONG>] [<EM>name</EM>]
               For each <EM>name</EM>, the full pathname of the command is
               determined and remembered.  The <STRONG>-r</STRONG> option causes the
               shell to forget all remembered locations.  If no
               arguments are given, information about remembered
               commands is printed.  An argument of <STRONG>--</STRONG> disables option
               checking for the rest of the arguments.  The return
               status is true unless a <EM>name</EM> is not found or an illegal
               option is supplied.

          <STRONG>help</STRONG> [<EM>pattern</EM>]
               Display helpful information about builtin commands.  If
               <EM>pattern</EM> is specified, <STRONG>help</STRONG> gives detailed help on all
               commands matching <EM>pattern</EM>; otherwise a list of the
               builtins is printed.  The return status is 0 unless no
               command matches <EM>pattern</EM>.

          <STRONG>history</STRONG> [<STRONG>n</STRONG>]
          <STRONG>history</STRONG> <STRONG>-rwan</STRONG> [<EM>filename</EM>]
               With no options, display the command history list with
               line numbers.  Lines listed with a <STRONG>*</STRONG> have been
               modified.  An argument of <STRONG>n</STRONG> lists only the last <STRONG>n</STRONG>
               lines.  If a non-option argument is supplied, it is
               used as the name of the history file; if not, the value
               of <STRONG>HISTFILE</STRONG> is used.  Options, if supplied, have the
               following meanings:
               <STRONG>-a</STRONG>   Append the ``new'' history lines (history lines
                    entered since the beginning of the current <STRONG>bash</STRONG>
                    session) to the history file
               <STRONG>-n</STRONG>   Read the history lines not already read from the
                    history file into the current history list.  These
                    are lines appended to the history file since the
                    beginning of the current <STRONG>bash</STRONG> session.
               <STRONG>-r</STRONG>   Read the contents of the history file and use them
                    as the current history
               <STRONG>-w</STRONG>   Write the current history to the history file,
                    overwriting the history file's contents.

               The return value is 0 unless an illegal option is
               encountered or an error occurs while reading or writing
               the history file.

          <STRONG>jobs</STRONG> [<STRONG>-lnp</STRONG>] [ <EM>jobspec</EM> ... ]
          <STRONG>jobs</STRONG> <STRONG>-x</STRONG> <EM>command</EM> [ <EM>args</EM> ... ]
               The first form lists the active jobs.  The <STRONG>-l</STRONG> option
               lists process IDs in addition to the normal
               information; the <STRONG>-p</STRONG> option lists only the process ID of
               the job's process group leader.  The <STRONG>-n</STRONG> option displays
               only jobs that have changed status since last notified.
               If <EM>jobspec</EM> is given, output is restricted to
               information about that job.  The return status is 0
               unless an illegal option is encountered or an illegal
               <EM>jobspec</EM> is supplied.

               If the <STRONG>-x</STRONG> option is supplied, <STRONG>jobs</STRONG> replaces any <EM>jobspec</EM>
               found in <EM>command</EM> or <EM>args</EM> with the corresponding process
               group ID, and executes <EM>command</EM> passing it <EM>args</EM>,
               returning its exit status.

          <STRONG>kill</STRONG> [<STRONG>-s</STRONG> <STRONG>sigspec</STRONG> | <STRONG>-sigspec</STRONG>] [<EM>pid</EM> | <EM>jobspec</EM>] ...
          <STRONG>kill</STRONG> <STRONG>-l</STRONG> [<EM>signum</EM>]
               Send the signal named by <EM>sigspec</EM> to the processes named
               by <EM>pid</EM> or <EM>jobspec</EM>.  <EM>sigspec</EM> is either a signal name
               such as <STRONG>SIGKILL</STRONG> or a signal number.  If <EM>sigspec</EM> is a
               signal name, the name is case insensitive and may be
               given with or without the <STRONG>SIG</STRONG> prefix.  If <EM>sigspec</EM> is
               not present, then <STRONG>SIGTERM</STRONG> is assumed.  An argument of
               <STRONG>-l</STRONG> lists the signal names.  If any arguments are
               supplied when <STRONG>-l</STRONG> is given, the names of the specified
               signals are listed, and the return status is 0.  An
               argument of <STRONG>--</STRONG> disables option checking for the rest of
               the arguments.  <STRONG>kill</STRONG> returns true if at least one
               signal was successfully sent, or false if an error
               occurs or an illegal option is encountered.

          <STRONG>let</STRONG> <EM>arg</EM> [<EM>arg</EM> ...]
               Each <EM>arg</EM> is an arithmetic expression to be evaluated
               (see <STRONG>ARITHMETIC</STRONG> <STRONG>EVALUATION</STRONG>).  If the last <EM>arg</EM> evaluates
               to 0, <STRONG>let</STRONG> returns 1; 0 is returned otherwise.

          <STRONG>local</STRONG> [<EM>name</EM>[=<EM>value</EM>] ...]
               For each argument, create a local variable named <EM>name</EM>,
               and assign it <EM>value</EM>.  When <STRONG>local</STRONG> is used within a
               function, it causes the variable <EM>name</EM> to have a visible
               scope restricted to that function and its children.
               With no operands, <STRONG>local</STRONG> writes a list of local
               variables to the standard output.  It is an error to
               use <STRONG>local</STRONG> when not within a function.  The return
               status is 0 unless <STRONG>local</STRONG> is used outside a function, or
               an illegal <EM>name</EM> is supplied.

          <STRONG>logout</STRONG>
               Exit a login shell.

          <STRONG>popd</STRONG> [<STRONG>+/-n</STRONG>]
               Removes entries from the directory stack.  With no
               arguments, removes the top directory from the stack,
               and performs a <STRONG>cd</STRONG> to the new top directory.
               <STRONG>+n</STRONG>   removes the <STRONG>n</STRONG>th entry counting from the left of
                    the list shown by <STRONG>dirs</STRONG>, starting with zero.  For
                    example: ``popd +0'' removes the first directory,
                    ``popd +1'' the second.
               <STRONG>-n</STRONG>   removes the <STRONG>n</STRONG>th entry counting from the right of
                    the list shown by <STRONG>dirs</STRONG>, starting with zero.  For
                    example: ``popd -0'' removes the last directory,
                    ``popd -1'' the next to last.

               If the <STRONG>popd</STRONG> command is successful, a <STRONG>dirs</STRONG> is performed
               as well, and the return status is 0.  <STRONG>popd</STRONG> returns
               false if an illegal option is encountered, the
               directory stack is empty, a non-existent directory
               stack entry is specified, or the directory change
               fails.

          <STRONG>pushd</STRONG> [<EM>dir</EM>]
          <STRONG>pushd</STRONG> <STRONG>+/-n</STRONG>
               Adds a directory to the top of the directory stack, or
               rotates the stack, making the new top of the stack the
               current working directory.  With no arguments,
               exchanges the top two directories and returns 0, unless
               the directory stack is empty.
               <STRONG>+n</STRONG>   Rotates the stack so that the <STRONG>n</STRONG>th directory
                    (counting from the left of the list shown by <STRONG>dirs</STRONG>)
                    is at the top.
               <STRONG>-n</STRONG>   Rotates the stack so that the <STRONG>n</STRONG>th directory
                    (counting from the right) is at the top.
               <STRONG>dir</STRONG>  adds <EM>dir</EM> to the directory stack at the top, making
                    it the new current working directory.

               If the <STRONG>pushd</STRONG> command is successful, a <STRONG>dirs</STRONG> is performed
               as well.  If the first form is used, <STRONG>pushd</STRONG> returns 0
               unless the cd to <EM>dir</EM> fails.  With the second form,
               <STRONG>pushd</STRONG> returns 0 unless the directory stack is empty, a
               non-existant directory stack element is specified, or
               the directory change to the specified new current
               directory fails.

          <STRONG>pwd</STRONG>  Print the absolute pathname of the current working
               directory.  The path printed contains no symbolic links
               if the <STRONG>-P</STRONG> option to the <STRONG>set</STRONG> builtin command is set.
               See also the description of <STRONG>nolinks</STRONG> under <STRONG>Shell</STRONG>
               <STRONG>Variables</STRONG> above).  The return status is 0 unless an
               error occurs while reading the pathname of the current
               directory.

          <STRONG>read</STRONG> [<STRONG>-r</STRONG>] [<EM>name</EM> ...]
               One line is read from the standard input, and the first
               word is assigned to the first <EM>name</EM>, the second word to
               the second <EM>name</EM>, and so on, with leftover words
               assigned to the last <EM>name</EM>.  Only the characters in <STRONG>IFS</STRONG>
               are recognized as word delimiters.  If no <EM>names</EM> are
               supplied, the line read is assigned to the variable
               <STRONG>REPLY</STRONG>.  The return code is zero, unless end-of-file is
               encountered.  If the <STRONG>-r</STRONG> option is given, a backslash-
               newline pair is not ignored, and the backslash is
               considered to be part of the line.

          <STRONG>readonly</STRONG> [<STRONG>-f</STRONG>] [<EM>name</EM> ...]
          <STRONG>readonly</STRONG> <STRONG>-p</STRONG>
               The given <EM>names</EM> are marked readonly and the values of
               these <EM>names</EM> may not be changed by subsequent
               assignment.  If the <STRONG>-f</STRONG> option is supplied, the
               functions corresponding to the <EM>names</EM> are so marked.  If
               no arguments are given, or if the <STRONG>-p</STRONG> option is
               supplied, a list of all readonly names is printed.  An
               argument of <STRONG>--</STRONG> disables option checking for the rest of
               the arguments.  The return status is 0 unless an
               illegal option is encountered, one of the <EM>names</EM> is not
               a legal shell variable name, or <STRONG>-f</STRONG> is supplied with a
               <EM>name</EM> that is not a function.

          <STRONG>return</STRONG> [<STRONG>n</STRONG>]
               Causes a function to exit with the return value
               specified by <STRONG>n</STRONG>.  If <STRONG>n</STRONG> is omitted, the return status is
               that of the last command executed in the function body.
               If used outside a function, but during execution of a
               script by the <STRONG>.</STRONG> (<STRONG>source</STRONG>) command, it causes the shell
               to stop executing that script and return either <STRONG>n</STRONG> or
               the exit status of the last command executed within the
               script as the exit status of the script.  If used
               outside a function and not during execution of a script
               by <STRONG>.</STRONG>, the return status is false.

          <STRONG>set</STRONG> [<STRONG>--abefhkmnptuvxldCHP</STRONG>] [<STRONG>-o</STRONG> <EM>option</EM>] [<EM>arg</EM> ...]
               <STRONG>-a</STRONG>      Automatically mark variables which are modified
                       or created for export to the environment of
                       subsequent commands.
               <STRONG>-b</STRONG>      Cause the status of terminated background jobs
                       to be reported immediately, rather than before
                       the next primary prompt.  (Also see <STRONG>notify</STRONG>
                       under <STRONG>Shell</STRONG> <STRONG>Variables</STRONG> above).
               <STRONG>-e</STRONG>      Exit immediately if a <EM>simple</EM>-<EM>command</EM> (see <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG>
                       <STRONG>GRAMMAR</STRONG> above) exits with a non-zero status.
                       The shell does not exit if the command that
                       fails is part of an <EM>until</EM> or <EM>while</EM> loop, part
                       of an <EM>if</EM> statement, part of a <STRONG>&amp;&amp;</STRONG> or <STRONG>||</STRONG> list, or
                       if the command's return value is being inverted
                       via <STRONG>!</STRONG>.
               <STRONG>-f</STRONG>      Disable pathname expansion.
               <STRONG>-h</STRONG>      Locate and remember function commands as
                       functions are defined.  Function commands are
                       normally looked up when the function is
                       executed.
               <STRONG>-k</STRONG>      All keyword arguments are placed in the
                       environment for a command, not just those that
                       precede the command name.
               <STRONG>-m</STRONG>      Monitor mode.  Job control is enabled.  This
                       flag is on by default for interactive shells on
                       systems that support it (see <STRONG>JOB</STRONG> <STRONG>CONTROL</STRONG>
                       above).  Background processes run in a separate
                       process group and a line containing their exit
                       status is printed upon their completion.
               <STRONG>-n</STRONG>      Read commands but do not execute them.  This
                       may be used to check a shell script for syntax
                       errors.  This is ignored for interactive
                       shells.
               <STRONG>-o</STRONG> <EM>option</EM>-<EM>name</EM>
                       The <EM>option</EM>-<EM>name</EM> can be one of the following:
                       <STRONG>allexport</STRONG>
                               Same as <STRONG>-a</STRONG>.
                       <STRONG>braceexpand</STRONG>
                               The shell performs brace expansion (see
                               <STRONG>Brace</STRONG> <STRONG>Expansion</STRONG> above).  This is on by
                               default.
                       <STRONG>emacs</STRONG>   Use an emacs-style command line editing
                               interface.  This is enabled by default
                               when the shell is interactive, unless
                               the shell is started with the
                               <STRONG>-nolineediting</STRONG> option.
                       <STRONG>errexit</STRONG> Same as <STRONG>-e</STRONG>.
                       <STRONG>histexpand</STRONG>
                               Same as <STRONG>-H</STRONG>.
                       <STRONG>ignoreeof</STRONG>
                               The effect is as if the shell command
                               `IGNOREEOF=10' had been executed (see
                               <STRONG>Shell</STRONG> <STRONG>Variables</STRONG> above).
                       <STRONG>interactive-comments</STRONG>
                               Allow a word beginning with <STRONG>#</STRONG> to cause
                               that word and all remaining characters
                               on that line to be ignored in an
                               interactive shell (see <STRONG>COMMENTS</STRONG> above).
                       <STRONG>monitor</STRONG> Same as <STRONG>-m</STRONG>.
                       <STRONG>noclobber</STRONG>
                               Same as <STRONG>-C</STRONG>.
                       <STRONG>noexec</STRONG>  Same as <STRONG>-n</STRONG>.
                       <STRONG>noglob</STRONG>  Same as <STRONG>-f</STRONG>.

                       <STRONG>nounset</STRONG> Same as <STRONG>-u</STRONG>.
                       <STRONG>physical</STRONG>
                               Same as <STRONG>-P</STRONG>.
                       <STRONG>posix</STRONG>   Change the behavior of bash where the
                               default operation differs from the
                               Posix 1003.2 standard to match the
                               standard.
                       <STRONG>privileged</STRONG>
                               Same as <STRONG>-p</STRONG>.
                       <STRONG>verbose</STRONG> Same as <STRONG>-v</STRONG>.
                       <STRONG>vi</STRONG>      Use a vi-style command line editing
                               interface.
                       <STRONG>xtrace</STRONG>  Same as <STRONG>-x</STRONG>.
                       If no <EM>option</EM>-<EM>name</EM> is supplied, the values of
                       the current options are printed.
               <STRONG>-p</STRONG>      Turn on <EM>privileged</EM> mode.  In this mode, the
                       <STRONG>$ENV</STRONG> file is not processed, and shell functions
                       are not inherited from the environment.  This
                       is enabled automatically on startup if the
                       effective user (group) id is not equal to the
                       real user (group) id.  Turning this option off
                       causes the effective user and group ids to be
                       set to the real user and group ids.
               <STRONG>-t</STRONG>      Exit after reading and executing one command.
               <STRONG>-u</STRONG>      Treat unset variables as an error when
                       performing parameter expansion.  If expansion
                       is attempted on an unset variable, the shell
                       prints an error message, and, if not
                       interactive, exits with a non-zero status.
               <STRONG>-v</STRONG>      Print shell input lines as they are read.
               <STRONG>-x</STRONG>      After expanding each <EM>simple</EM>-<EM>command</EM>, <STRONG>bash</STRONG>
                       displays the expanded value of <STRONG>PS4</STRONG>, followed by
                       the command and its expanded arguments.
               <STRONG>-l</STRONG>      Save and restore the binding of <EM>name</EM> in a <STRONG>for</STRONG>
                       <EM>name</EM> [in <STRONG>word</STRONG>] command (see <STRONG>SHELL</STRONG> <STRONG>GRAMMAR</STRONG>
                       above).
               <STRONG>-d</STRONG>      Disable the hashing of commands that are looked
                       up for execution.  Normally, commands are
                       remembered in a hash table, and once found, do
                       not have to be looked up again.
               <STRONG>-C</STRONG>      The effect is as if the shell command
                       `noclobber=' had been executed (see <STRONG>Shell</STRONG>
                       <STRONG>Variables</STRONG> above).
               <STRONG>-H</STRONG>      Enable <STRONG>!</STRONG> style history substitution.  This flag
                       is on by default when the shell is interactive.
               <STRONG>-P</STRONG>      If set, do not follow symbolic links when
                       performing commands such as <STRONG>cd</STRONG> which change the
                       current directory.  The physical directory is
                       used instead.
               <STRONG>--</STRONG>      If no arguments follow this flag, then the
                       positional parameters are unset.  Otherwise,
                       the positional parameters are set to the <EM>arg</EM>s,
                       even if some of them begin with a <STRONG>-</STRONG>.
               <STRONG>-</STRONG>       Signal the end of options, cause all remaining
                       <EM>arg</EM>s to be assigned to the positional
                       parameters.  The <STRONG>-x</STRONG> and <STRONG>-v</STRONG> options are turned
                       off.  If there are no <EM>arg</EM>s, the positional
                       parameters remain unchanged.

               The flags are off by default unless otherwise noted.
               Using + rather than - causes these flags to be turned
               off.  The flags can also be specified as options to an
               invocation of the shell.  The current set of flags may
               be found in <STRONG>$-</STRONG>.  After the option arguments are
               processed, the remaining <STRONG>n</STRONG> <EM>arg</EM>s are treated as values
               for the positional parameters and are assigned, in
               order, to <STRONG>$1</STRONG>, <STRONG>$2</STRONG>, <STRONG>...</STRONG> <STRONG>$n</STRONG>.  If no options or <EM>arg</EM>s are
               supplied, all shell variables are printed.  The return
               status is always true unless an illegal option is
               encountered.

          <STRONG>shift</STRONG> [<STRONG>n</STRONG>]
               The positional parameters from <STRONG>n</STRONG>+1 ... are renamed to
               <STRONG>$1</STRONG> <STRONG>....</STRONG> Parameters represented by the numbers <STRONG>$#</STRONG> down
               to <STRONG>$#</STRONG>-<STRONG>n</STRONG>+1 are unset.  If <STRONG>n</STRONG> is 0, no parameters are
               changed.  If <STRONG>n</STRONG> is not given, it is assumed to be 1.  <STRONG>n</STRONG>
               must be a non-negative number less than or equal to <STRONG>$#</STRONG>.
               If <STRONG>n</STRONG> is greater than <STRONG>$#</STRONG>, the positional parameters are
               not changed.  The return status is greater than 0 if <STRONG>n</STRONG>
               is greater than <STRONG>$#</STRONG> or less than 0; otherwise 0.

          <STRONG>suspend</STRONG> [<STRONG>-f</STRONG>]
               Suspend the execution of this shell until it receives a
               <STRONG>SIGCONT</STRONG> signal.  The <STRONG>-f</STRONG> option says not to complain if
               this is a login shell; just suspend anyway.  The return
               status is 0 unless the shell is a login shell and <STRONG>-f</STRONG> is
               not supplied, or if job control is not enabled.

          <STRONG>test</STRONG> <EM>expr</EM>
          <STRONG>[</STRONG> <EM>expr</EM> <STRONG>]</STRONG>
               Return a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on
               the evaluation of the conditional expression <EM>expr</EM>.
               Expressions may be unary or binary.  Unary expressions
               are often used to examine the status of a file.  There
               are string operators and numeric comparison operators
               as well.  Each operator and operand must be a separate
               argument.  If <EM>file</EM> is of the form /dev/fd/<STRONG>n</STRONG>, then file
               descriptor <STRONG>n</STRONG> is checked.
               <STRONG>-b</STRONG> <EM>file</EM>
                    True if <EM>file</EM> exists and is block special.
               <STRONG>-c</STRONG> <EM>file</EM>
                    True if <EM>file</EM> exists and is character special.

                    True if either <EM>expr1</EM> OR <EM>expr2</EM> is true.
               <EM>arg1</EM> <STRONG>OP</STRONG> <EM>arg2</EM>
                    <STRONG>OP</STRONG> is one of <STRONG>-eq</STRONG>, <STRONG>-ne</STRONG>, <STRONG>-lt</STRONG>, <STRONG>-le</STRONG>, <STRONG>-gt</STRONG>, or <STRONG>-ge</STRONG>.
                    These arithmetic binary operators return true if
                    <EM>arg1</EM> is equal, not-equal, less-than, less-than-
                    or-equal, greater-than, or greater-than-or-equal
                    than <EM>arg2</EM>, respectively.  <EM>Arg1</EM> and <EM>arg2</EM> may be
                    positive integers, negative integers, or the
                    special expression <STRONG>-l</STRONG> <EM>string</EM>, which evaluates to
                    the length of <EM>string</EM>.

          <STRONG>times</STRONG>
               Print the accumulated user and system times for the
               shell and for processes run from the shell.  The return
               status is 0.

          <STRONG>trap</STRONG> [<STRONG>-l</STRONG>] [<EM>arg</EM>] [<EM>sigspec</EM>]
               The command <EM>arg</EM> is to be read and executed when the
               shell receives signal(s) <EM>sigspec</EM>.  If <EM>arg</EM> is absent or
               <STRONG>-</STRONG>, all specified signals are reset to their original
               values (the values they had upon entrance to the
               shell).  If <EM>arg</EM> is the null string this signal is
               ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes.
               <EM>sigspec</EM> is either a signal name defined in &lt;<EM>signal.h</EM>&gt;,
               or a signal number. If <EM>sigspec</EM> is <STRONG>EXIT</STRONG> (0) the command
               <EM>arg</EM> is executed on exit from the shell.  With no
               arguments, <STRONG>trap</STRONG> prints the list of commands associated
               with each signal number.  The <STRONG>-l</STRONG> option causes the
               shell to print a list of signal names and their
               corresponding numbers.  An argument of <STRONG>--</STRONG> disables
               option checking for the rest of the arguments.  Signals
               ignored upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped or
               reset.  Trapped signals are reset to their original
               values in a child process when it is created.  The
               return status is false if either the trap name or
               number is invalid; otherwise <STRONG>trap</STRONG> returns true.

          <STRONG>type</STRONG> [<STRONG>-all</STRONG>] [<STRONG>-type</STRONG> | <STRONG>-path</STRONG>] <EM>name</EM> [<EM>name</EM> ...]
               With no options, indicate how each <EM>name</EM> would be
               interpreted if used as a command name.  If the <STRONG>-type</STRONG>
               flag is used, <STRONG>type</STRONG> prints a phrase which is one of
               <EM>alias</EM>, <EM>keyword</EM>, <EM>function</EM>, <EM>builtin</EM>, or <EM>file</EM> if <EM>name</EM> is
               an alias, shell reserved word, function, builtin, or
               disk file, respectively. If the name is not found, then
               nothing is printed, and an exit status of false is
               returned.  If the <STRONG>-path</STRONG> flag is used, <STRONG>type</STRONG> either
               returns the name of the disk file that would be
               executed if <EM>name</EM> were specified as a command name, or
               nothing if <STRONG>-type</STRONG> would not return <EM>file</EM>.  If a command
               is hashed, <STRONG>-path</STRONG> prints the hashed value, not
               necessarily the file that appears first in <STRONG>PATH</STRONG>.  If
               the <STRONG>-all</STRONG> flag is used, <STRONG>type</STRONG> prints all of the places
               that contain an executable named <EM>name</EM>.  This includes
               aliases and functions, if and only if the <STRONG>-path</STRONG> flag is
               not also used.  The table of hashed commands is not
               consulted when using <STRONG>-all</STRONG>.  <STRONG>type</STRONG> accepts <STRONG>-a</STRONG>, <STRONG>-t</STRONG>, and <STRONG>-p</STRONG>
               in place of <STRONG>-all</STRONG>, <STRONG>-type</STRONG>, and <STRONG>-path</STRONG>, respectively.  An
               argument of <STRONG>--</STRONG> disables option checking for the rest of
               the arguments.  <STRONG>type</STRONG> returns true if any of the
               arguments are found, false if none are found.

          <STRONG>ulimit</STRONG> [<STRONG>-SHacdfmstpnuv</STRONG> [<EM>limit</EM>]]
               <STRONG>Ulimit</STRONG> provides control over the resources available to
               the shell and to processes started by it, on systems
               that allow such control.  The value of <EM>limit</EM> can be a
               number in the unit specified for the resource, or the
               value <STRONG>unlimited</STRONG>.  The <STRONG>H</STRONG> and <STRONG>S</STRONG> options specify that the
               hard or soft limit is set for the given resource.  A
               hard limit cannot be increased once it is set; a soft
               limit may be increased up to the value of the hard
               limit.  If neither <STRONG>H</STRONG> nor <STRONG>S</STRONG> is specified, the command
               applies to the soft limit.  If <EM>limit</EM> is omitted, the
               current value of the soft limit of the resource is
               printed, unless the <STRONG>H</STRONG> option is given.  When more than
               one resource is specified, the limit name and unit is
               printed before the value.  Other options are
               interpreted as follows:
               <STRONG>-a</STRONG>   all current limits are reported
               <STRONG>-c</STRONG>   the maximum size of core files created
               <STRONG>-d</STRONG>   the maximum size of a process's data segment
               <STRONG>-f</STRONG>   the maximum size of files created by the shell
               <STRONG>-m</STRONG>   the maximum resident set size
               <STRONG>-s</STRONG>   the maximum stack size
               <STRONG>-t</STRONG>   the maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
               <STRONG>-p</STRONG>   the pipe size in 512-byte blocks (this may not be
                    set)
               <STRONG>-n</STRONG>   the maximum number of open file descriptors (most
                    systems do not allow this value to be set, only
                    displayed)
               <STRONG>-u</STRONG>   the maximum number of processes available to a
                    single user
               <STRONG>-v</STRONG>   The maximum amount of virtual memory available to
                    the shell

               An argument of <STRONG>--</STRONG> disables option checking for the rest
               of the arguments.  If <EM>limit</EM> is given, it is the new
               value of the specified resource (the <STRONG>-a</STRONG> option is
               display only).  If no option is given, then <STRONG>-f</STRONG> is
               assumed.  Values are in 1024-byte increments, except
               for <STRONG>-t</STRONG>, which is in seconds, <STRONG>-p</STRONG>, which is in units of
               512-byte blocks, and <STRONG>-n</STRONG> and <STRONG>-u</STRONG>, which are unscaled
               values.  The return status is 0 unless an illegal
               option is encountered, a non-numeric argument other
               than <STRONG>unlimited</STRONG> is supplied as <EM>limit</EM>, or an error occurs
               while setting a new limit.

          <STRONG>umask</STRONG> [<STRONG>-S</STRONG>] [<EM>mode</EM>]
               The user file-creation mask is set to <EM>mode</EM>.  If <EM>mode</EM>
               begins with a digit, it is interpreted as an octal
               number; otherwise it is interpreted as a symbolic mode
               mask similar to that accepted by <EM>chmod</EM>(1).  If <EM>mode</EM> is
               omitted, or if the <STRONG>-S</STRONG> option is supplied, the current
               value of the mask is printed.  The <STRONG>-S</STRONG> option causes the
               mask to be printed in symbolic form; the default output
               is an octal number.  An argument of <STRONG>--</STRONG> disables option
               checking for the rest of the arguments.  The return
               status is 0 if the mode was successfully changed or if
               no <EM>mode</EM> argument was supplied, and false otherwise.

          <STRONG>unalias</STRONG> [-<STRONG>a</STRONG>] [<EM>name</EM> ...]
               Remove <EM>name</EM>s from the list of defined aliases.  If <STRONG>-a</STRONG>
               is supplied, all alias definitions are removed.  The
               return value is true unless a supplied <EM>name</EM> is not a
               defined alias.

          <STRONG>unset</STRONG> [-<STRONG>fv</STRONG>] [<EM>name</EM> ...]
               For each <EM>name</EM>, remove the corresponding variable or,
               given the <STRONG>-f</STRONG> option, function.  An argument of <STRONG>--</STRONG>
               disables option checking for the rest of the arguments.
               Note that <STRONG>PATH</STRONG>, <STRONG>IFS</STRONG>, <STRONG>PPID</STRONG>, <STRONG>PS1</STRONG>, <STRONG>PS2</STRONG>, <STRONG>UID</STRONG>, and <STRONG>EUID</STRONG>
               cannot be unset.  If any of <STRONG>RANDOM</STRONG>, <STRONG>SECONDS</STRONG>, <STRONG>LINENO</STRONG>, or
               <STRONG>HISTCMD</STRONG> are unset, they lose their special properties,
               even if they are subsequently reset.  The exit status
               is true unless a <EM>name</EM> does not exist or is non-
               unsettable.

          <STRONG>wait</STRONG> [<STRONG>n</STRONG>]
               Wait for the specified process and return its
               termination status.  <STRONG>n</STRONG> may be a process ID or a job
               specification; if a job spec is given, all processes in
               that job's pipeline are waited for.  If <STRONG>n</STRONG> is not given,
               all currently active child processes are waited for,
               and the return status is zero.  If <STRONG>n</STRONG> specifies a non-
               existant process or job, the return status is 127.
               Otherwise, the return status is the exit status of the
               last process or job waited for.

     <STRONG>INVOCATION</STRONG>
          A <EM>login</EM> <EM>shell</EM> is one whose first character of argument zero
          is a <STRONG>-</STRONG>, or one started with the <STRONG>-login</STRONG> flag.

          An <EM>interactive</EM> shell is one whose standard input and output
          are both connected to terminals (as determined by
          <EM>isatty</EM>(3)), or one started with the <STRONG>-i</STRONG> option.  <STRONG>PS1</STRONG> is set
          and <STRONG>$-</STRONG> includes <STRONG>i</STRONG> if <STRONG>bash</STRONG> is interactive, allowing a shell
          script or a startup file to test this state.

          Login shells:
            On login (subject to the <STRONG>-noprofile</STRONG> option):
                  if /<EM>etc</EM>/<EM>profile</EM> exists, source it.

                  if ~/.<EM>bash_profile</EM> exists, source it,
                    else if ~/.<EM>bash_login</EM> exists, source it,
                      else if ~/.<EM>profile</EM> exists, source it.

            On exit:
                  if ~/.<EM>bash_logout</EM> exists, source it.

          Non-login interactive shells:
            On startup (subject to the <STRONG>-norc</STRONG> and <STRONG>-rcfile</STRONG> options):
                  if ~/.<EM>bashrc</EM> exists, source it.

          Non-interactive shells:
            On startup:
                  if the environment variable <STRONG>ENV</STRONG> is non-null, expand
                  it and source the file it names, as if the command
                          if [ "$ENV" ]; then . $ENV; fi
                  had been executed, but do not use <STRONG>PATH</STRONG> to search
                  for the pathname.  When not started in Posix mode, bash
                  looks for <STRONG>BASH_ENV</STRONG> before <STRONG>ENV</STRONG>.

          If Bash is invoked as <STRONG>sh</STRONG>, it tries to mimic the behavior of
          <STRONG>sh</STRONG> as closely as possible.  For a login shell, it attempts
          to source only /<EM>etc</EM>/<EM>profile</EM> and ~/.<EM>profile</EM>, in that order.
          The <STRONG>-noprofile</STRONG> option may still be used to disable this
          behavior.  A shell invoked as <STRONG>sh</STRONG> does not attempt to source
          any other startup files.

          When <STRONG>bash</STRONG> is started in <EM>posix</EM> mode, as with the <STRONG>-posix</STRONG>
          command line option, it follows the Posix standard for
          startup files.  In this mode, the <STRONG>ENV</STRONG> variable is expanded
          and that file sourced; no other startup files are read.

     <STRONG>BUG</STRONG> <STRONG>REPORTS</STRONG>
          If you find a bug in <STRONG>bash,</STRONG> you should report it.  But first,
          you should make sure that it really is a bug, and that it
          appears in the latest version of <STRONG>bash</STRONG> that you have.

          Once you have determined that a bug actually exists, mail a
          bug report to <EM>bash</EM>-<EM>maintainers</EM>@<EM>prep.ai</EM>.<EM>MIT.Edu</EM>.  If you have
          a fix, you are welcome to mail that as well!  Suggestions
          and `philosophical' bug reports may be mailed to <EM>bug</EM>-
          <EM>bash</EM>@<EM>prep.ai</EM>.<EM>MIT.Edu</EM> or posted to the Usenet newsgroup
          <STRONG>gnu.bash.bug</STRONG>.

          ALL bug reports should include:

          The version number of <STRONG>bash</STRONG>
          The hardware and operating system
          The compiler used to compile
          A description of the bug behaviour
          A short script or `recipe' which exercises the bug

          Comments and bug reports concerning this manual page should
          be directed to <EM>chet</EM>@<EM>ins.CWRU</EM>.<EM>Edu</EM>.

     <STRONG>BUGS</STRONG>
          It's too big and too slow.

          There are some subtle differences between <STRONG>bash</STRONG> and
          traditional versions of <STRONG>sh</STRONG>, mostly because of the <STRONG>POSIX</STRONG>
          specification.

          Aliases are confusing in some uses.
