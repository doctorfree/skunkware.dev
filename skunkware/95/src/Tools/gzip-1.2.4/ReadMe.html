<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
Gzip is a file compressor, like compress, but uses a better
compression algorithm.  Gunzip will uncompress not only
gziped files, but also several other formats (compress,
pack).  Also has several handy utilities, one of which
allows you to keep infrequently used binaries compressed,
and still run them

<DD>Better compression, compressed binaries save disk space
