<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
MD5 computes a crytographic checksum of either a string given it
on the command line, or a set of files.
In this respect it is similar to the Unix sum program.
However, MD5 produces a 128-bit message digest (checksum) that is
very sensitive to its input.
<P>
It is conjectured that the difficulty of coming up with two messages
having the same message digest is on the order of 2^64 operations,
and that the difficulty of coming up with any message having a given
message digest is on the order of 2^128 operations.
<DT><B>Productivity</B>
<DD>
Many people, CERT in particular, are starting to provide MD5 checksums
for files they distribute.  Once you obtain a copy you can compute
the MD5 checksum of it, and if it matches, you can be very certain that
the file has not been modified since it was created by the author.
<DT><B>Safety</B>
<DD>
The code for this program was taken bit for bit from RFC1321 which has
been widely read and analyzed.
<DT><B>Work Planned</B>
<DD>
None.

A manual page.
<DT><B>Verification</B>
<DD>
The Makefile contains an "rfc.test" target which will produce a set of
message digest of known strings.  Running "md5 -x" will compute the
same message digests.  If they match, the program works.  The "make test"
target will do all of this.
