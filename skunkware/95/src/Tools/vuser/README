	The vuser program is intended to be used to replay
interactive sessions.  It does this by recording the users key
strokes and the systems responses, and then replaying the
sequences at a later time.

vuser understands the following options:

	-p num	Set the recorded prompt length to num characters.
		Default is 10.

	-t num	Send the non-interactive timeout to be num seconds.
		If the expected prompt is not seen in that
		amount of time, vuser will procced as if the
		prompt had been seen.  Setting the timeout to 0
		will cause vuser to wait forever for a prompt.
		Default is 30 seconds.

	-s name	Generate a script file to the file named name for
		future playback.  The default is not to generate
		a script file.

	-r name Record all characters sent to the standard output
		in the file named name.  The default is not to
		record the characters sent to the standard output.

	-e	Use the rest of the command line as the command 
		to run rather than the program specified by the
		environment variable SHELL.  If SHELL is not set,
		then the default is /bin/sh.

	-l user host	Shorthand for ``-e rlogin host -l user''.

If either -e or -l is specified, it must be the last option on
the command line.

	To replay a session at a later time, run vuser with the
same command line options as for the interactive session, but do
not specify -s, and redirect the input from the script file that
was generated during the interactive session.


Examples:

To run vuser interactively and generate a script file for later
replaying, you would use a command similar to:

	vuser -s script.in -e bash

This will run the program bash, recording what the user types,
and what the program sends back.  When bash terminates, vuser
will also terminate.  To replay the session at a later time you
would use the command:

	vuser -e bash <script.in
