<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
From the beginning of the manual page...
<P>
Perl is an interpreted language optimized for scanning
arbitrary text files, extracting information from those text
files, and printing reports based on that information.  It's
also a good language for many system management tasks.  The
language is intended to be practical (easy to use,
efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant,
minimal).  It combines (in the author's opinion, anyway)
some of the best features of C, sed, awk, and sh, so people
familiar with those languages should have little difficulty
with it.

<DT><B>Productivity</B>
<DD>Also from the manual page...

If you have a problem that would ordinarily use sed or
awk or sh, but it exceeds their capabilities or must
run a little faster, and you don't want to write the
silly thing in C, then Perl may be for you.

<DT><B>Documentation</B>
<DD>Manual page

For World Wide Web aficionados, there is a lot of
material available from the "North American Perl
Archive" at URL="http://www.cis.ufl.edu/perl/".  In
addition to maintaining a large archive of scripts,
this site also provides HTML-ized versions of the Perl
man page and FAQ doc.

<DT><B>Verification</B>
<DD>Included in the perl distribution is an extensive test
suite.  This version passes all of the tests except
for the one which tests the bigint.pl library
package.  (The failure is reported to be due to a bug
in our C compiler.)  For what it's worth, the
previously contributed version also failed the same
test.

There are some sample programs in the "eg"
subdirectory of the source directory.
