<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
mkid builds a database of all identifiers in a set of
source files, and which files they were found in.
The database can be searched very quickly for specific
identifiers, regular expressions, numbers in any base,
and so on.

Very useful for finding your way around new (to you)
or very large programs.

This version had some pointer cleanup (to make it run
on VX/VE), and an RJG added-value new flag.

<DT><B>Productivity</B>
<DD>Kept me from killing everyone who has ever worked for
a certain database company, and I wouldn't have been
nearly so productive from my jail cell.

<DT><B>Safety</B>
<DD>I've used it for a couple of years, as has the rest
of the ORACLE project, VX/VE when I was on it, UNIX900
people used it as well, I believe.  I also went over
much of the code cleaning it up for VX/VE.  I hate the
capitalization the guy uses, but I wouldn't call it
unsafe.

<DT><B>Work Planned</B>
<DD>None

<DT><B>Documentation</B>
<DD>man pages for mkid, [aegl]id, usage messages for fid
and idx

<DT><B>Verification</B>
<DD>Try "mkid -v *.[ch]" and a few searches like "gid direct"
"lid -v if", "aid ook".
