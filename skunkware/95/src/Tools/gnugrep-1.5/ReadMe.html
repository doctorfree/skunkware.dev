<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
This is functionally similar to the regular grep you
know and love, but it uses faster algorithms so that its "about
twice as fast as stock Unix egrep" (their words, not mine).

<DT><B>Productivity</B>
<DD>I haven't compared this to bm but I do know its significantly
faster than regular grep.

<DT><B>Safety</B>
<DD>I used an earlier version of this for about four months.  

<DT><B>Work Planned</B>
<DD>None (but I will re-submit updated versions)

<DT><B>Verification</B>
<DD>grep "news" /etc/passwd
If you get something, odds are good that it works.   The
makefile also does some regression tests of its own.
