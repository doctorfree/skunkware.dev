 Earl,

 first of all, I want to thank you a lot for this wonderful package. It's
really a great job. So great that immediately after trying man2html, I managed
to install related CGI scripts in my HTTP server; this is where the story
starts.

 I'd like to focus your attention about serious security problems if those
scripts. In fact, some filehandles are opened to a pipe which arguments come
directly from user's query.

 For example, in "manpage", we have:

	$mancommand   = "man $manflags $topic";

 and later:

	open (MAN, "$mancommand 2> /dev/null |")

 Now, if the user submits:

	ls ; rm -rf /

 as a topic, the whole command "man ls ; rm -rf /" is executed :-(

 As suggested in the "camel book", I replaced those commands with something as:

	open (MAN,"-|") || exec 'man',$manflags,$topic;

 which is more secure.

 Excuse me if I wasted your time. Cheers,

    -JCT-
