<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
man2html takes formatted nroff in standard input (STDIN) and outputs
the HTML to standard output (STDOUT). The formatted nroff output is
surrounded with &lt;PRE&gt; tags with the following exceptions/additions:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Section heads are wrapped in HTML header tags. See Section Head
Map File for more information. This feature can be turned off
with the -noheads command-line option.
<LI>
Overstriken words designated with the "&lt;char&gt;&lt;backspace&gt;&lt;char&gt;"
sequences are wrapped in &lt;STRONG&gt; tags.
<LI>
Overstriken words designated with the "_&lt;backspace&gt;&lt;char&gt;"
sequences (ie. underlined words) are wrapped in &lt;EM&gt; tags.
</UL>
<P>
man2html also does the following:
<UL>
<LI>
Merges the multi-page formatted nroff into a single page. See
Usage for information on how to tell man2html the page size and
margin width/heights of the formatted nroff. Depagination can be
turned off with the -nodepage command-line option.
<LI>
Creates links to other manpages if the -cgiurl command-line option
is specified.
</UL>
<P>
By default, man2html does not put a title, &lt;TITLE&gt;, in the HTML file.
However, one can specify a title via the -title command-line option.

<DD>Most man pages come as troff input, but our Everest man technology
is designed around HTML.  This allows those troff input files to be
converted non-interactively.

<DD>Take your favourite man pages, run it through <em>gnroff -man</em>
then pipe that output into man2html.  Look at the result with Mosaic.
