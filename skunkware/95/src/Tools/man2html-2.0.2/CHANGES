CHANGES for man2html

MM/DD/YY
===========================================================================
09/02/94	(2.0.2)

	o  Add the -bare option (for lack of a better name).  This
	   will keep man2html from inserting the HTML, HEAD, BODY
	   tags from the output.  This is useful if used in a CGI
	   script that wants to include the output from man2html into
	   an HTML document.


===========================================================================
08/19/94	(2.0.1)

	o  Fixed bug in not recognizing manpage cross-refs that
	   had a combination of bold-overstriking,
	   underline-overstriking, and plain text.

	o  Fixed bug in not detecting a <, >, or & to convert to an
	   entity if the character right before it was a <, >, or &.

	o  Speed increase.

===========================================================================
07/18/94	(2.0.0 beta)

	o  Support for processing output from 'man -k', i.e. a 
	   keyord search.  Links are created for all manpages
	   listed, and the manpages are sorted by section.

	o  Can now properly detect manpage references containing
	   '_', '.', '+' characters.

===========================================================================
07/15/94

	o  man2html supports the ability to link to other manpages.
