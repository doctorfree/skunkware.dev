For best results in running "bounce": install the Bounce.appdefaults file
as "Bounce" in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or equivalent. To replace text in
buttons with icons as shown in the book, edit the appdefaults file to
uncomment the last half of the file. Then, place the files run, runI, step,
stepI, stop, and stopI in the bitmap path (normally,
/usr/include/X11/bitmaps or your HOME directory, will work fine)
