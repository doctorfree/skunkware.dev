This directory contains the source to the examples in the book
"Object-Oriented Programming with C++ and OSF/Motif", by Doug Young,
Prentice Hall, 1992. ISBN 0-13-630252-1. The book can be ordered from
Prentice Hall at 201-767-5937.

NOTE: See the RELEASENOTES file for additional information about building
the examples, a list of problems, changes made to the code, or problems
found in the text since the book was sent to the printer, etc.

These sources are provided completely without warranty of any kind. They
are provided in the sincere hope that they are useful, (and to save people
who want to experiment with the ideas in the book a lot of typing!).
However, neither the examples themselves, nor the build structure have been
tested on any system other than an SGI IRIS Indigo.
