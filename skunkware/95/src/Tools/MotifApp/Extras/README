This directory contains some extra examples, variations of the examples in
the book. 

Bounce contains a Stage class that demonstrates the X double-buffering
extension. Note that on some systems the X extension header, multibuf.h,
does not automatically provide function prototypes suitable for C++. You
may need to provide these yourself.

TicTacToe has been reworked to use a one move lookahead to play a tougher
game.

SubMenus contains versions of classes described in the book that implement
support for nested cascading menus based on the Cmd architecture.

The file ch0.ps is an extra chapter in postscript form (cut from the book)
that introduces C++.  If you can't print postscript, ch0.txt is a text only
version.

Callbacks.ps is a postscript file that describes a slightly different
approach to using callbacks with C++ classes. This material was also
written for the book, but ended up on the cutting room floor. It may be
interesting to some people. Callbacks.txt is a text-only version.
