<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
You give this program a hex, octal or decimal representation of an
internet address and it converts it to both dotted decimal notation,
and a hostname.
<DT><B>Productivity</B>
<DD>The TCP code prints addresses this way when it receives a packet
with a bad checksum.  This program makes it easy to figure out which
host is sending the bad packets.
<DT><B>Safety</B>
<DD>Very safe, check out the 10 lines of code.
<DT><B>Work Planned</B>
<DD>None
<DT><B>Verification</B>
<DD>Run hostbyaddr 0x066a9384.  This should produce the output
132.147.106.6: sosco.sco.COM.
