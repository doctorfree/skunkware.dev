<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
This program allows you to query an archie server in
a non-interactive manner.  Archie servers maintain a
database of software that is available for anonymous ftp
at many thousands of sites on the internet.  Using archie
with a pattern to match allows one to find many places
from which a piece of software might be obtained.

<DT><B>Productivity</B>
<DD>There is lots of incredibly useful software available
for free on the internet, this program helps one find
that software.

<DT><B>Safety</B>
<DD>Examined code and used it for months

<DT><B>Verification</B>
<DD>Run "archie -V -m 1 gcc"  This should list one place on
the internet where the gcc compile is available.

Notes:          Be patient.  archie is not fast, it give precedence to
interactive users, and thus during busy times in the
middle of the day can take hours to complete.  If you
need an answer right away telnet to an archie server
and do the search interactively.
