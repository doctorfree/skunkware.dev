<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
Elm is a screen oriented editory that can be used instead of
mailx, or scomail to read/send mail.
<DT><B>Productivity</B>
<DD>
This program is much, much better than mailx for handling mail.
Unlink scomail, it can be run on non-X based terminals.

<DD>
This software is very widely distributed and used.  Also, I am part
of the ELM development team and am very familiar with the code.
It is used by many people at SCO Canada.
<DT><B>Work Planned</B>
<DD>
Elm 2.4 is frozen.  There might be one more patch release some time
in the future, but effectively it is done at PL24.  Elm 3.0, if it
happens at all, won't be available until late 1995 at the earliest.
