<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
This is the GNU version of diff.  Along with all the
regular BSD diff features, this also has some new features.

Look in the README file in this directory for a list of
those new features.

<DT><B>Productivity</B>
<DD>There are some nice features here.   Especially the
context differences and the ability to mark which function a
diff appears in.   It's supposed to be faster, too.

<DT><B>Safety</B>
<DD>I trust GNU, don't you?

<DT><B>Work Planned</B>
<DD>I'll try and stay up to new releases as they come out.

<DT><B>Verification</B>
<DD>Use vanilla diff and GNU diff on the same pair of files.
diff the results of each - they should match.
