a descendent of ofiles, fstat, lsof version 1, and lsof version 2.
It speaks the following Unix dialects:

	AIX 3.2.[45], 4.1, and		IBM RISC/System 6000
	    4.1.[12]
	DC/OSx 1.1			Pyramid ES, Nile, and S series

	FreeBSD 1.1.5.1, 2.0, and	Intel-based systems
	    2.0.5
	HP-UX 8.x, 9.x, and 10		HP
	IRIX 4.0.5, 5.2, 5.3, and 6.0	SGI
	Linux through 1.2.11		Intel-based systems
	NetBSD 1.0 and 1.0A		Intel and SPARC-based systems
	NEXTSTEP 2.1 and 3.[0123]	all NEXTSTEP architectures
	Novell UnixWare 1.1, 1.1.1,	Intel-based systems
	    and 1.1.2
	OSF/1 1.3, 2.0, 3.0, and 3.2	DEC Alpha

	    4.0.[23]
	Solaris 2.[1234]		Sun 4 and i86pc
	SunOS 4.1.[1234]		Sun 3 and 4
	Ultrix 2.2, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4	DEC RISC and VAX
	V/88 R32V3, R40V4.2, and	Motorola M88K
	    R40V4.3

(The pub/tools/unix/lsof/contrib directory on vic.cc.purdue.edu
contains information on other ports.)

Version 3 of lsof is distributed as gzip'd and compressed tar archives
in the files:

		pub/tools/unix/lsof/lsof.tar.gz
	and
		pub/tools/unix/lsof/lsof.tar.Z

These files are links to the current distribution, whose name
includes the revision number:

		pub/tools/unix/lsof_<rev>_W.tar.gz
	and
		pub/tools/unix/lsof_<rev>_W.tar.Z
	
<rev> is the revision number -- e.g., 3.37.  The ``_W'' marks the
tar file as a wrapper -- the source tar file is inside the wrapper.
(A tar file with a ``.gz'' suffix is gzip'd; ``.Z'', compressed.)
The wrapper method is used to join instruction and PGP certificate
files with their source tar file.  The PGP certificate file
authenticates the source tar file.

When the wrapper tar is gunzip'd or uncompressed, and its tar
contents are extracted, three files are produced in the current
directory where the extraction was performed:

	README.lsof_<rev>	contains instructions for the
				security-conscious on how to be
				sure that no one has tampered with
				the tar file.

	lsof_<rev>.tar		is a tar file, containing the lsof
				sources.  When extracted with tar
				it creates a subdirectory in the
				current directory where the extraction
				was performed, named lsof_<rev>.
				The lsof source files will be found in
				lsof_<rev>.

	lsof_<rev>.tar.asc	is a PGP certificate, authenticating
				the lsof_<rev>.tar file.  See the
				README.lsof_<rev> file for more
				information on PGP authentication of
				lsof_<rev>.tar.

If you've obtained this file and an lsof distribution from a mirror
site, please be aware that THE LATEST VERSION OF LSOF IS AVAILABLE
VIA ANONYMOUS FTP FROM VIC.CC.PURDUE.EDU (128.210.15.16) IN THE
PUB/TOOLS/UNIX/LSOF DIRECTORY.

(If you need a copy of gunzip, look for it at prep.ai.mit.edu in
pub/gnu.)

*  The June 30, 1995 revision (3.34) changes the offset display
   to decimal when possible; corrects the output of inode field
   output from signed to unsigned; documents the `*' prefix on the
   inode number; and expands the INODE output field width in the
   list_fields.{awk,perl} and list_NULf.perl5 scripts.

*  The July 9, 1995 revision (3.35) shortens the usage display
   when argument errors are detected; adds support for Solaris
   loopback files; contains Linux code to compare the system map
   file to /proc/ksyms; adds dot-form names to host name cache.

*  The July 21, 1995 revision (3.36): provides a default name cache
   size for dialects using a pointer-linked name cache when the
   kernel's name cache size variable value is zero; removes the
   use of the d_namlen struct dirent member from Linux when the
   version is 1.2.10 or greater; supports FreeBSD 2.0.5; deletes
   the previous operation of the -c, -d, -m, and -O options; replaces
   the former -c option with the -m option; adds with the changed
   -c option command name selection; relegates the previous action
   of the -d option to the WARNDEVACCESS compile-time definition;
   adds with the changed -d option file descriptor selection; adds
   with the changed -O option a low overhead mode; adds with the
   -r option a repeat mode.

*  The July 27, 1995 revision (3.37) revises option handling further:
   the -f -F and -0 options are combined in one, -F; values for some
   options (-F, -g, -r, and -S) are now optional, although some care
   must be taken to insure that a following option is not mistaken for
   a value.  The revision also contains: a minor correction to the
   handling of the -O option; an adjustment to the conditions for
   using d_namlen in the Linux dirent structure; and yet another
   attempt to write "standard" SunOS/Solaris install and deinstall
   Makefile rules.

See the 00DIST distribution file for more details on feature
additions and bug fixes.  The 00README distribution file gives
background and installation information.  The 00FAQ file contains
a list of frequently asked questions and their answers.  The
00PORTING file contains information on porting lsof to other Unix
dialects.  The distribution files lsof.8 (nroff source) and lsof.man
(nroff formatted output) contain the manual page for lsof; it is
the only other documentation besides the source code (it's included).


Version 3 Binaries
==================

Version 3 binaries for some revisions, dialects, and platforms may
be found in pub/tools/unix/lsof/binaries.  Check the README files
for exact descriptions.  Check the dialect-specific Makefiles for
installation instructions.  CHECKSUMS and PGP certificates are
provided for authentication.

Please think very carefully before you decide to use a binary from
this distribution instead of making your own from the sources.
Here are some points to consider:

1.  Lsof must run setgid or setuid.  Are you willing to trust
    that power to a binary you didn't construct yourself?

2.  Lsof binaries may be generated on a system whose configuration
    header files differ from yours.  Under OSF/1, for example, lsof
    includes header files from the machine's configuration directory,
    /sys/<name>.  Are you willing to gamble that your configuration
    directory's header files match the ones used to compile lsof?

3.  Lsof is often configured with specific options that are
    determined from the configuration of the system on which it is
    configured -- e.g., DECnet for Ultrix, RxFS for DC/OSx, Solaris
    patch level, Pyramid hardware architecture, dynamic loader
    libraries, etc.  Are you sure that the lsof binary you retrieve
    will have been configured for your system?  If you get a binary
    that is misconfigured for you, it may not work at all.

If you haven't already guessed, I believe firmly that you should
retrieve sources and build your own binary.  If you still want to
use the distribution binaries, please authenticate what you retrieved
with the PGP certificates; please compare checksums, too.


Version 3 Checksums
===================

Security checksums -- both MD5 and sum(1) -- for revisions of lsof
version 3 are contained in the README.lsof_<rev> files in the
wrapper tar files of pub/tools/unix/lsof.


PGP Certificates
================

The lsof source tar and binary files are accompanied by PGP
certificates in files that have an "asc" extension.  The certificates
are signed with my public key, which may be found in the file:

	pub/tools/unix/lsof/Victor_A_Abell.pgp

My key is also available via public key servers and the URL:

	http://www-rcd.cc.purdue.edu/abe/


Lsof Version 2
==============

The version 3 predecessor, revision 36 of version 2, is also
available in pub/tools/unix/lsof/OLD/lsof236tar.gz on vic.cc.purdue.edu.
I recommend you avoid it.  It's out of date and I no longer provide
support for it.  (Version 3 supports more dialects, and has many
enhancements, bug fixes, and improvements.)  Version 2 supports
the following Unix dialects.

	AIX 3.2.[1234]			IBM RISC/System 6000
	EP/IX 1.4.3 and 2.1.1		CDC 4680
	ETAV 1.17			ETA-10P*
	FreeBSD 1.0e			Intel-based architecture
	HP-UX [789].x			HP
	IRIX 4.0.5 and 5.1.1		SGI
	NEXTSTEP 2.1, 3.0, 3.1		NeXT
	OSF/1 1.[23] and 2.0		DEC Alpha
	Sequent Dynix 3.0.12		Sequent Symmetry
	SunOS 4.1.[123]			Sun 3 and 4
	SunOS 5.[13] (Solaris 2.[13])	Sun 4
	Ultrix 2.2 and 4.2		DEC

(If you need a copy of gunzip, look for it at prep.ai.mit.edu in
pub/gnu.)


Version 2 Checksums
===================

MD5:
	(OLD/lsof236tar.gz) = f8a1ab3971ea2f6a3ea16752f84409e8

sum(1):
	39996   106 OLD/lsof236tar.gz

The file OLD/lsof236tar.gz.asc is a PGP certificate that may be used to
authenticate OLD/lsof236tar.gz with my public key.  You may find my public
key on vic.cc.purdue.edu in pub/tools/unix/lsof/Victor_A_Abell.pgp; via
the URL http://www-rcd.cc.purdue.edu/abe/; or at public key servers.
