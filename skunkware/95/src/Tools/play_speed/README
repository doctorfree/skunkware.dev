play_speed is a simple program for playing raw (pcm) audio
files out to /dev/audio at a specific sample rate.  I wrote
it because I didn't have the netaudio utilities and I just
wanted to play out audio files that I downloaded from IUMA
(The Internet Underground Music Archive, URL
"http://www.iuma.com/") and decompressed with maplay.

To compile: gcc -O2 -o play_speed play_speed.c

You will need the audio driver installed already, so that
<sys/audio.h> will be present for the definition of the
AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE ioctl.  That's all you need the header
file for; if you know what the ioctl is, but don't have
that file, then just edit it in.  :)

To play a file, do: play_speed rate < file.pcm

For example, to play the output of an "maplay -s -8" from
an MPEG-II coded file that was recorded at 44.1 kHz (so
that the pcm file is at 22.05 kHz), where the pcm file is
"/tmp/foo.pcm", do

	play_speed 22050 < /tmp/foo.pcm

and the sound will be played out /dev/audio.

This program shouldn't be necessary if you have netaudio.

Addendum 03-Aug-94 rr@sco.com :
I have modified play_speed.c so that it can be compiled to use
the Soundblaster driver included in tls022 and tls023. This
entails #include'ing sb.h rather than audio.h, opening /dev/sbdsp
rather than /dev/audio, and using the DSP_IOCTL_SPEED ioctl.

To compile play_speed for use with /dev/audio, use
	gcc -D_AUDIO_ -O2 -o play_speed play_speed.c
To compile play_speed for use with /dev/sbdsp, use 
	gcc -O2 -o play_speed play_speed.c
