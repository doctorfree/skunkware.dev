<P>Caveat: This overview does not attempt to provide an introduction to object
orientation.

<P>Object Tcl is a standard Tcl extension package that makes it possible to use
object oriented programming concepts from within Tcl and, if required, provides
a tight object oriented coupling to C++.

<P>From the Tcl perspective, Object Tcl provides additional commands to support the
description of classes of objects, along with attributes and methods, and
manipulation of those classes. The concepts introduced into Tcl
are:

<UL>
<LI> Class
<LI> Object
<LI> Method 
<LI> Attribute
<LI> Class Method
<LI> Class Attribute
<LI> Object Reference
</UL>

<P>In Object Tcl, a class description contains details of its behaviors, via 
methods, and state, via attributes. Object Tcl classes may have methods and
attributes that have class scope or object scope.

<P>Object Tcl classes may inherit from other classes, described in Object Tcl or
C++, as a way of structuring and reusing common code. Both single and
multiple inheritance is available. 

<P>Object Tcl classes may be instantiated to create objects of that class. The
instantiation of a class results in an object reference that may be used 
to invoke methods upon the object.
Finally, objects may be discarded.

<P>A primary objective of Object Tcl is to support the reuse of classes that
are 
described in C++. Object Tcl makes it possible to create new classes in Tcl that
inherit from C++ classes. The dynamic binding of virtual methods crosses the
boundary from Tcl to C++ and, if the method is called on the object from C++, 
will cross over into Tcl if the method is defined in the Tcl subclass.

<P>The tight coupling to C++ makes it possible to build a class hierarchy or
framework in C++ that can then be extended using the interpreted Tcl language.
