<a name="Classes"><H2>Classes</H2></a>

<P>In Object Tcl, a class describes the behavior and state information 
common to a particular collection of objects. Objects are of a particular
class in the same way as variables are of a particular type.

<P>Objects are created by instantiating a class and specifying its initial
creation parameters.

<P>There are two parts to the description of a class.
The first part is the <a href="#Interface">class interface</a> 
which is a description of the class
with respect to the outside world. 
The second part is the <a href="#Implementation">class implementation</a>
which is the description of how the behavior of the class is implemented.

<a name="Interface"><H3>Class Interface</H3></a>

<P>The command:

<PRE>otclInterface <VAR>name ?-isA classlist? body</VAR></PRE>

<P>provides a new class interface description.

<P>The <VAR>name</VAR> parameter specifies the name of the new class.

<P>The <var>-isA classList</var> parameter is optional and may be used to specify 
class <a href="#Inheritance">inheritance</a>.
The <var>classList</var> must be a list of names of classes 
that have already been fully described to the Object Tcl interpreter, or built-in 
<a href="BindingRef.html">C++ classes</a>. No name may be repeated in the list
of classes.

<P>The <var>body</var> parameter is a Tcl script that describes the interface
of the new class. Within the body script, the following commands may be used:

<dl>

<dt><code>constructor <var>argList</var></code>

<dd>This command describes the interface of the <a href="#Constructors">
constructor method</a> 
for the class in question. The <var>argList</var> parameter specifies a 
list of arguments for the constructor. Default values may be specified. 

<p>

<dt><code>method <var>name argList</var></code>

<dd>This command describes the interface of an
<a href="#Methods">instance method</a> 
for the class in question. The <var>argList</var> parameter specifies a list 
of arguments for the instance method. Default values may be specified.

<p>

<dt><code>classMethod <var>name argList</var></code>

<dd>This command describes the interface of a <a href="#Methods">class method</a>
for 
the class in question. The <var>argList</var> parameter specifies a list of
argments for the class method. Default values may be specified.
</dl>

<P>All methods described in the class interface section, class or instance,
are <a href="#PubAndPriv">public</a>.

<a name="Implementation"><H3>Class Implementation</H3></a>

<P>The command:

<pre>otclImplementation <var>name body</var></pre>

<P>provides the class implementation description. 

<P>The <var>name</var> parameter specifies the name of the class that
this command is providing
the implementation for. The class named must be a class that has
previously had its class interface specified using the 
<a href="#Interface">otclInterface</a>
command and has not had its class implementation specified.

<P>The <var>body</var> parameter is a Tcl script that describes the implementation
of the 
class. Within the <var>body</var> script, the following commands may be used:

<dl>

<dt><code>constructor <var>argList parentList body</var></code>

<dd>This command describes the implementation of the 
<a href="#Constructors">constructor method</a>.
The <var>argList</var> parameter specifies the arguments 
to the constructor, the <var>parentList</var> parameter describes the
construction of the parent classes and the <var>body</var> parameter is a Tcl
script 
that describes the body of the constructor.

<p>

<dt><code>destructor <var>body</var></code>

<dd>This command describes the implementation of the
<a href="#Destructors">destructor  method</a>.
The <var>body</var> parameter is a Tcl script that describes 
the body of the destructor.

<p>

<dt><code>method <var>name argList body</var></code>

<dd>This command describes the implementation of an 
<a href="#Methods">instance method</a>.
The <var>name</var> parameter specifies the name of the method, the 
<var>argList</var> specifies the arguments accepted by the method and the 
<var>body</var> is a Tcl script that describes the body of the method.

<p>

<dt><code>classMethod <var>name argList body</var></code>

<dd>This command describes the implementation of a 
<a href="#Methods">class method</a>. 
The <var>name</var> parameter specifies the name of the method, the 
<var>argList</var> specifies the arguments accepted by the method and the 
<var>body</var> is a Tcl script that describes the body of the method.

<p>

<dt><code>attribute <var>name ?value?</var></code>

<dd>This command describes an 
<a href="#Attributes">instance attribute</a>. The <var>name</var> 
parameter specifies the name of the attribute and the optional <var>value</var> 
parameter specifies the value to initialize the attribute with when an 
instance is created.

<p>

<dt><code>classAttribute <var>name value</var></code>

<dd>This command describes a
<a href="#Attributes">class attribute</a>. The <var>name</var>
parameter specifies the name of the attribute and the <var>value</var> parameter 
specifies the value to initialize the attribute with when the
otclImplementation command has completed.
</dl>

<a name="Inheritance"><H3>Inheritance</H3></a>

<P>An Object Tcl class may use the <var>-isA classList</var> option in the 
<a href="#Interface">otclInterface</a> command to specify class inheritance.
Object Tcl supports 
single and multiple inheritance. Object Tcl classes may inherit from other 
Object Tcl classes or built-in 
<a href="BindingRef.html">C++ classes</a>.

<P>Object Tcl classes may only inherit from other Object Tcl classes that have
had both their interface and implementation successfully described.

<P>Multiple inheritance of a single root class results in tree inheritance
rather than lattice. Object Tcl does not provide an equivalent to the C++
virtual base classes. 

<a name="Attributes"><H3>Attributes</H3></a>

<P>Attributes are used to record state information within classes and objects. 
There are two types of attribute: instance and class. Instance attributes have 
separate instantiations for each object of that class. Each object may alter
its 
instance attributes independently of any other object of that class. Class 
attributes have only one instance that is shared by all objects of that class.

<P>Both instance and class attributes are private in that they are not
accessible 
from outside the class, only from within the class by class or instance method 
bodies.

<P>Both instance attributes and class attributes may have an initial value
specified. For class attributes, the initial value is mandatory. Instance attributes are
initialized with 
their initial value or "" before the 
<a href="#Constructors">constructor</a> for that class is executed.
Class attributes are initialized with their initial value when
the
<a href="#Implementation">class implementation</a> description is complete.

<a name="This"><H4>This</H4></a>

<P>An implicit instance attribute exists called <STRONG>this</STRONG>.
This attribute is only in 
scope within an <a href="#Methods">instance method</a> and its value
is a reference to the current 
object. The <STRONG>this</STRONG> attribute may be used to invoke other instance methods 
upon the current object or be passed to other commands as an argument.

<P>It is forbidden to modify the value of <STRONG>this</STRONG>, but this is
not detected by the Object Tcl system.

<a name="AttributeNaming"><H4>Naming</H4></a>

<P>Class attributes and instance attributes share the same name space and must 
be unique within a class.

<P>The name "this" is reserved.

<a name="AttributeAccess"><H4>Access</H4></a>

<P>From within an <a href="#Methods">instance method</a> all instance
attributes and
class 
attributes are available as local Tcl variables. The Tcl <code>$</code> substitution syntax 
may be used.

<P>From within <a href="#Methods">class methods</a> all class attributes
are available as
local 
Tcl variables. The Tcl <code>$</code> substitution syntax may be used.

<a name="AttributeArrays"><H4>Arrays</H4></a>

<p>Object Tcl supports instance and class array attributes. The 
description of an array attribute takes the following form:

<dl>
<dt><code>attribute <var>name</var>() <var>?value?</var></code>
<dd>The brackets after the attribute <var>name</var>, with no white space,
indicates that the attribute is an array. If an initial value is supplied 
it must be a list of <code>{<var>key value</var>}</code> pairs. For example:

<p><code>attribute sales() {{jan 12} {feb 13} {mar 44}}</code>
</dl>

<p>Array attributes may be manipulated in the same way as Tcl arrays using
the <code>$</code> substitution syntax with a key as a bracketed suffix. For example:

<p><code>puts $sales(mar)</code>


<a name="Methods"><H3>Methods</H3></a>

<P>Methods are used to give behavior to a class of object. There are two types of 
methods: class and instance. Class methods operate at the class scope and 
may manipulate <a href="#Attributes">class attributes</a>. Instance methods
operate on an 
object scope and must be invoked upon an object of that class. 
Instance methods
may access <a href="#Attributes">class attributes</a> and 
<a href="#Attributes">instance attributes</a>. 
Instance methods may invoke class methods. Class methods may only invoke 
instance methods if an object reference is available.

<a name="MethodNaming"><H4>Naming</H4></a>

<P>Method names must be unique within a class. Instance and class methods of 
the same class share the same name space.

<P>If a class uses <a href="#Inheritance">inheritance</a> then it may 
describe a method with
the 
same name as a method in one of its parent classes. This is allowed as the 
<a href="#Dynamic">dynamic binding</a> resolves the name at invocation time.

<P>A class may also describe a class method with the same name as a class or 
instance method in one of its parent classes. In this case the syntax of class 
method <a href="#Invocation">invocation</a> identifies the class to find the 
method in.

<P>The names "constructor" and "destructor" are reserved.

<P>Naming an instance method 
<a href="#Unknown">unknown</a>
implies specific behavior.

<a name="Unknown"><H4>Unknown</H4></a>

<P>Object Tcl classes, and even C++ classes exported to Object Tcl, may have
an instance method called <STRONG>unknown</STRONG>. The 
<STRONG>unknown</STRONG> method is 
invoked automatically by the Object Tcl system when an attempt is made to
invoke a method upon the object that is not in the class's implementation.

<P>The <STRONG>unknown</STRONG> method is called with the arguments
specified in the original method invocation with the name of the requested
method prepended.

<P>The <STRONG>unknown</STRONG> method may be inherited from a superclass
and the rules of <a href="#Dynamic">dynamic binding</a> operate.

<a name="Dynamic"><H4>Dynamic Binding</H4></a>

<P>Classes that use <a href="#Inheritance">inheritance</a> may provide methods
that are also
provided
by their parent classes. Dynamic binding is the mechanism whereby the 
method of the most specific class is executed. This allows classes to
specialize 
the classes they inherit from to make them more specific.

<P>Given an object of a particular class, the invocation of a method involves a 
search through the inheritance hierarchy for that method. The search starts at 
the most specific class, the instantiated class, and proceeds in a depth-first 
search. If multiple inheritance is used, the list of superclasses is searched
in 
the order they were given in the <var>-isA classList</var> option of the
<a href="#Interface">otclInterface</a> command. There is no checking for
two descriptions of 
the named method at the same level in the hierarchy. The first method in the 
search order will be executed.

<a name="PubAndPriv"><H4>Public &amp; Private Methods</H4></a>

<P>Class or instance methods may be public or private. If a method is public 
then it may be invoked by any other piece of Tcl code. If a method is private 
then it may only be invoked from another method of that class.

<P>Methods are public if their interface is described in the 
<a href="#Interface">otclInterface</a>
command, otherwise they are private.

<P>For public methods, default parameter values must be specified in the 
<a href="#Interface">class interface</a>. Private methods must have their
default values
specified in the 
<a href="#Implementation">class implementation</a>.

<a name="Constructors"><H4>Constructors</H4></a>

<P>The constructor method is a special instance method that is invoked
automatically upon the <a href="#Constructing">construction</a> of a new instance of
the class.
Constructors may be used to initialize attribute values and perform
initialization 
behavior.

<P>The implementation description for a constructor method contains a
parameter called <var>parentList</var>. This list contains a description of the 
parameters to pass to the constructor of any inherited classes. The
<var>parentList</var> takes the form of a list of scripts, where each script starts
with the 
name of the parent class and is followed by a series of Tcl expressions that
are 
to be passed to the parent class constructor. If an inherited class constructor 
takes no arguments then it need not appear as an item in the <var>parentList</var>. 
The expressions in the <var>parentList</var> may make use of any class or instance 
attributes of the calling class or any of the formal arguments passed to the 
calling class constructor.

<p>The <var>parentList</var> parameter is mandatory even for classes that do
not use inheritance. In this case they must specify an empty
<var>parentList</var>.

<P>Constructors are optional.

<P>When using <a href="#Inheritance">inheritance</a>, the most general class
constructor body is evaluated 
first and the most specific last. If multiple inheritance is used then the
constructor for the inherited classes are executed in the order they are
described 
in the <var>-isA classList</var> option of the <a href="#Interface">otclInterface</a>
command for that class.

<P>A constructor is considered an instance method in that the 
<a href="#This">this</a> attribute is 
available and may be used to invoke other methods upon the object. The 
dynamic binding of methods will operate correctly but it must be
remembered that the object is undergoing construction. Using dynamic binding it 
would be possible to invoke a method from a part of the class hierarchy for 
that object that is still waiting for its constructor to be evaluated.

<a name="Destructors"><H4>Destructors</H4></a>

<P>The destructor is a special method that cannot be public (there is no
command 
appropriate for making it public anyway). Destructors are the opposite to
<a href="#Constructors">constructors</a>
in that they are invoked automatically upon the destruction of an 
instance of the class.

<P>Destructors are optional.

<P>Destructors are executed in the reverse order to constructors. The most
specific destructor is executed first, and if multiple inheritance is used the 
destructors for the multiple superclasses are invoked in the reverse order to 
that specified in the <var>-isA classList</var> option of the
<a href="#Interface">otclInterface</a> command for that class.

<P>As with constructors, destructors are treated the same as instance methods.
They may call other methods upon the object, so it is possible to call methods 
upon parts of the object that have already had their destructor invoked.

<a name="Invocation"><H4>Invocation</H4></a>

<P>Class <a href="#Methods">methods</a> and instance methods are invoked in
different ways.

<P>A class method may be invoked using the following syntax:

<pre><var>class method ?args ...?</var></pre>

<P>where <var>class</var> is the name of the class to invoke the method upon,
<var>method</var> is 
the name of the class method to invoke and <var>arg</var> is an argument to pass
to the class method.

<P>An instance method may be invoked using the following syntax:

<pre><var>obref method ?arg ...?</var></pre>

<P>where <var>obref</var> is an object reference, <var>method</var> is the name of
the method to 
invoke and <var>arg</var> is an argument to pass to the instance method.

<P>Another instance method may be invoked from within the body of another
instance method using the following syntax:

<pre>$this <var>?-parent? method ?arg ...?</var></pre>

<P>where <var>method</var> is the name of the method to invoke and
<var>arg</var> is an argument 
to pass to the instance method. The <var>?-parent?</var> option may be used to
force 
the invocation of the method from the immediate parent class. This facility 
may be used to override the dynamic binding feature, thus allowing the most 
specific version of a method to utilize a more general version of the method. 
The parent class must be one of the classes named in the <var>-isA classList</var> 
section of the <a href="#Interface">otclInterface</a> command.

<P>Constructors and destructors cannot be invoked explicitly.

<a name="Results"><H4>Results</H4></a>

<P>Class methods and instance methods may return results using the Tcl return 
command as in normal Tcl procedures.

<P><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/skunkware/pics/gif/buttons/line.blue.gif" ALT=""><P>
<a name="Objects"><H2>Objects</H2></a>

<P>Objects in Object Tcl are instances of classes. All instances of the same
class 
share common behavior, through methods, and maintain similar state
information, through attributes.

<P>Objects are <a href="#Constructing">constructed</a> by instantiating
an Object Tcl 
<a href="#Classes">class</a> or a 
built-in 
<a href="BindingRef.html">C++ class</a>.
<a href="#Methods">Methods</a> may then be invoked upon that object 
which alter its state. Finally an object may be 
<a href="#Destructing">destroyed</a>.

<a name="Constructing"><H4>Constructing</H4></a>

<P>An object is constructed by instantiating a class using the following
command:

<pre>otclNew <var>class ?arg...?</var></pre>

<P>where <var>class</var> specifies the name of the class to instantiate and
<var>arg</var> specifies 
an argument to pass to the <a href="#Constructors">constructor</a>
of the class. The result
of 
this command is a reference to the new object. This reference may be used to 
<a href="#Invocation">invoke methods</a> upon that object.

<a name="Destructing"><H4>Destructing</H4></a>

<P>When an object is finished with it may be deleted using the following
command:

<pre>otclDelete <var>objref</var></pre>

<P>where <var>objref</var> is a reference to an Object Tcl object as created by the
<a href="#Constructing">otclNew</a>
command.

<P>After an object has been deleted, all references to that object are invalid
and 
must not be used. The result of dereferencing an invalid reference will vary 
depending on the object mapping implementation. If the object 
mapper is capable of detecting the dereference then a Tcl error will be 
reported, otherwise the dereference will result in memory misuse and
probable core dump.
