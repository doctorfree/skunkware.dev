     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          These procedures provide a safe mechanism for  dealing  with
          asynchronous  events such as signals.  If an event such as a
          signal occurs while a Tcl script is being evaluated then  it
          isn't  safe  to  take  any substantive action to process the
          event.  For example, it isn't safe to evaluate a Tcl  script
          since  the  intepreter  may  already  be  in  the  middle of
          evaluating a script; it may not even  be  safe  to  allocate
          memory,  since  a  memory  allocation  could  have  been  in
          progress when the event occurred.  The only safe approach is
          to  set  a  flag  indicating  that  the event occurred, then
          handle the event later when the  world  has  returned  to  a
          clean   state,   such  as  after  the  current  Tcl  command
          completes.

          <STRONG>Tcl_AsyncCreate</STRONG> creates an asynchronous handler and  returns
          a  token  for  it.  The asynchronous handler must be created
          before any occurrences of the asynchronous event that it  is
          intended  to  handle  (it is not safe to create a handler at
          the time of an event).  When an  asynchronous  event  occurs
          the  code  that detects the event (such as a signal handler)
          should call <STRONG>Tcl_AsyncMark</STRONG> with the token  for  the  handler.
          <STRONG>Tcl_AsyncMark</STRONG> will mark the handler as ready to execute, but
          it will not invoke the handler immediately.  Tcl  will  call
          the  <EM>proc</EM>  associated with the handler later, when the world
          is in a safe state, and <EM>proc</EM> can then carry out the  actions
          associated  with  the  asynchronous event.  <EM>Proc</EM> should have
          arguments and result that match the type <STRONG>Tcl_AsyncProc</STRONG>:
               typedef int Tcl_AsyncProc(
                    ClientData <EM>clientData</EM>,
                    Tcl_Interp *<EM>interp</EM>,
                    int <EM>code)</EM>;
          The <EM>clientData</EM> will be the same as the  <EM>clientData</EM>  argument
          passed  to <STRONG>Tcl_AsyncCreate</STRONG> when the handler was created.  If
          <EM>proc</EM> is invoked just after a command has completed execution
          in an interpreter, then <EM>interp</EM> will identify the interpreter
          in which the command was evaluated  and  <EM>code</EM>  will  be  the
          completion  code  returned  by  that command.  The command's
          result  will  be  present  in  <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>.   When   <EM>proc</EM>
          returns,  whatever  it  leaves  in  <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>  will  be
          returned as the result of the command and the integer  value
          returned by <EM>proc</EM> will be used as the new completion code for
          the command.

          It  is  also  possible  for  <EM>proc</EM>  to  be  invoked  when  no
          interpreter  is active.  This can happen, for example, if an
          asynchronous event occurs while the application  is  waiting
          for  interactive  input  or an X event.  In this case <EM>interp</EM>
          will be NULL and <EM>code</EM> will be 0, and the return  value  from
          <EM>proc</EM> will be ignored.

          The procedure <STRONG>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</STRONG> is called to invoke all of the
          handlers that are ready.  The global variable <STRONG>tcl_AsyncReady</STRONG>
          will be non-zero  whenever  any  asynchronous  handlers  are
          ready;   it can be checked to avoid calls to <STRONG>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</STRONG>
          when there are no ready handlers.  Tcl checks <STRONG>tcl_AsyncReady</STRONG>
          after each command is evaluated and calls <STRONG>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</STRONG> if
          needed.   Applications  may  also  call  <STRONG>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</STRONG>  at
          interesting  times  for that application.  For example, Tk's
          event handler checks <STRONG>tcl_AsyncReady</STRONG>  after  each  event  and
          calls  <STRONG>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</STRONG>  if  needed.   The  <EM>interp</EM>  and  <EM>code</EM>
          arguments to <STRONG>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</STRONG> have the same  meaning  as  for
          <EM>proc</EM>:   they identify the active intepreter, if any, and the
          completion code from the command that just completed.

          <STRONG>Tcl_AsyncDelete</STRONG> removes an asynchronous handler so that  its
          <EM>proc</EM>  will never be invoked again.  A handler can be deleted
          even when ready, and it will still not be invoked.

          If multiple handlers become active at  the  same  time,  the
          handlers  are invoked in the order they were created (oldest
          handler first).   The  <EM>code</EM>  and  <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>  for  later
          handlers reflect the values returned by earlier handlers, so
          that the most recently created handler has  last  say  about
          the  interpreter's  result  and  completion  code.   If  new
          handlers  become  ready  while   handlers   are   executing,
          <STRONG>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</STRONG>  will  invoke  them  all;   at each point it
          invokes  the  highest-priority   (oldest)   ready   handler,
          repeating  this  over and over until there are no longer any
          ready handlers.


     <STRONG>WARNING</STRONG>
          It is almost always a bad idea  for  an  asynchronous  event
          handler  to modify <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM> or return a code different
          from its <EM>code</EM> argument.  This sort of behavior  can  disrupt
          the  execution  of scripts in subtle ways and result in bugs
          that  are  extremely  difficult  to  track  down.    If   an
          asynchronous  event  handler  needs  to evaluate Tcl scripts
          then it should first save <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM> plus the values  of
          the variables <STRONG>errorInfo</STRONG> and <STRONG>errorCode</STRONG> (this can be done, for
          example, by storing them  in  dynamic  strings).   When  the
          asynchronous  handler  is finished it should restore <EM>interp</EM>-
          &gt;<EM>result</EM>, <STRONG>errorInfo</STRONG>,  and  <STRONG>errorCode</STRONG>,  and  return  the  <EM>code</EM>
          argument.
