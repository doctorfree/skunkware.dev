          Tcl_Interp   *<EM>interp</EM>         (in)      Interpreter  to   use
                                                 for error reporting.

          int          <EM>argc</EM>            (in)      Number of strings  in
                                                 <EM>argv</EM> array.

          char         **<EM>argv</EM>          (in)      Array   of    strings
                                                 describing command(s)

                                                 identifiers.      The
                                                 array is  dynamically
                                                 allocated and must be
                                                 freed by the caller.

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          <STRONG>Tcl_CreatePipeline</STRONG> processes the <EM>argv</EM> array and sets up  one
          or   more  child  processes  in  a  pipeline  configuration.
          <STRONG>Tcl_CreatePipeline</STRONG> handles pipes specified with ``|'', input
          redirection  specified  with  ``&lt;''  or  ``&lt;&lt;'',  and output
          redirection specified with ``&gt;'';  see the documentation for
          the  <STRONG>exec</STRONG>  command for details on these specifications.  The
          return value from  <STRONG>Tcl_CreatePipeline</STRONG>  is  a  count  of  the
          number  of child processes created;  the process identifiers
          for those processes are stored in a <EM>malloc</EM>-ed  array  and  a
          pointer  to that array is stored at *<EM>pidArrayPtr</EM>.  It is the
          caller's responsibility to free the array when finished with
          it.

          If the <EM>inPipePtr</EM>, <EM>outPipePtr</EM>, and <EM>errFilePtr</EM>  arguments  are
          NULL  then  the  pipeline's standard input, standard output,
          and standard error are taken from the corresponding  streams
          of  the process.  Non-NULL values may be specified for these
          arguments to use  pipes  for  standard  input  and  standard
          output  and  a  file for standard error.  <STRONG>Tcl_CreatePipeline</STRONG>
          will create the requested pipes  or  file  and  return  file
          identifiers  that  may be used to read or write them.  It is
          the caller's responsibility to close all of these files when
          they  are  no  longer needed.  If <EM>argv</EM> specifies redirection
          for standard input or standard output, then pipes  will  not
          be created even if requested by the <EM>inPipePtr</EM> and <EM>outPipePtr</EM>
          arguments.

          If an error occurs  in  <STRONG>Tcl_CreatePipeline</STRONG>  (e.g.  ``|''  or
          ``&lt;''  was  the last argument in <EM>argv</EM>, or it wasn't possible
          to fork off a child), then -1 is returned and <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>
          is set to an error message.
