     <STRONG>ARGUMENTS</STRONG>
          Tcl_Interp   *<EM>interp</EM>      (in)      Tcl   interpreter   from
                                              which   file  is  to  be
                                              accessed.

          FILE         *<EM>file</EM>        (in)      Handle for file that  is
                                              to  become accessible in
                                              <EM>interp</EM>.

          int          <EM>permissions</EM>  (in)      OR-ed   combination   of
                                              TCL_FILE_READABLE    and
                                              TCL_FILE_WRITABLE;
                                              indicates  whether  <EM>file</EM>
                                              was opened  for  reading
                                              or writing or both.

          char         *<EM>string</EM>      (in)      String identifying file,
                                              such as <STRONG>stdin</STRONG> or <STRONG>file4</STRONG>.

          int          <EM>write</EM>        (in)      Non-zero means the  file
                                              will    be    used   for
                                              writing, zero  means  it
                                              will    be    used   for
                                              reading.

          int          <EM>checkUsage</EM>   (in)      If  non-zero,  then   an
                                              error  will be generated
                                              if   the   file   wasn't
                                              opened  for  the  access
                                              indicated by <EM>write</EM>.

          FILE         **<EM>filePtr</EM>    (out)     Points to word in  which
                                              to store pointer to FILE
                                              structure for  the  file
                                              given by <EM>string</EM>.

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          These  procedures  provide  access  to  Tcl's  file   naming
          mechanism.   <STRONG>Tcl_EnterFile</STRONG>  enters  an  open file into Tcl's
          file table so that it can be  accessed  using  Tcl  commands
          like  <STRONG>gets</STRONG>,  <STRONG>puts</STRONG>,  <STRONG>seek</STRONG>,  and <STRONG>close</STRONG>.  It returns in <EM>interp</EM>-
          &gt;<EM>result</EM> an identifier such as <STRONG>file4</STRONG>  that  can  be  used  to
          refer to the file in subsequent Tcl commands.  <STRONG>Tcl_EnterFile</STRONG>
          is typically used to implement new Tcl  commands  that  open
          sockets,   pipes,  or  other  kinds  of  files  not  already
          supported by the built-in commands.

          <STRONG>Tcl_GetOpenFile</STRONG> takes as argument a file identifier  of  the
          form  returned  by  the  <STRONG>open</STRONG>  command  or <STRONG>Tcl_EnterFile</STRONG> and
          returns at *<EM>filePtr</EM> a pointer to the FILE structure for  the
          file.  The <EM>write</EM> argument indicates whether the FILE pointer
          will be used for reading or writing.  In some cases, such as
          a   file  that  connects  to  a  pipeline  of  subprocesses,
          different FILE pointers will be  returned  for  reading  and
          writing.   <STRONG>Tcl_GetOpenFile</STRONG>  normally  returns TCL_OK.  If an
          error occurs in <STRONG>Tcl_GetOpenFile</STRONG> (e.g. <EM>string</EM> didn't make any
          sense  or  <EM>checkUsage</EM> was set and the file wasn't opened for
          the access specified by <EM>write)</EM> then  TCL_ERROR  is  returned
          and  <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>  will  contain  an  error  message.   If
          <EM>checkUsage</EM> is zero and the file wasn't opened for the access
          specified  by  <EM>write</EM>,  then  the  FILE  pointer  returned at
          *<EM>filePtr</EM> may not correspond to <EM>write</EM>.

          <STRONG>Tcl_FilePermissions</STRONG> returns an OR-ed combination of the mask
          bits TCL_FILE_READABLE and TCL_FILE_WRITABLE; these indicate
          whether the given file was opened for reading or writing  or
          both.   If <EM>file</EM> does not refer to a file in Tcl's file table
          then -1 is returned.
