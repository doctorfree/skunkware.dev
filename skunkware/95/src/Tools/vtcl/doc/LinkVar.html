                                            Tcl variable read-only.

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          <STRONG>Tcl_LinkVar</STRONG> uses variable traces to keep  the  Tcl  variable
          named  by <EM>varName</EM> in sync with the C variable at the address
          given by <EM>addr</EM>.  Whenever the Tcl variable is read the  value
          of  the  C  variable  will be returned, and whenever the Tcl
          variable is written the C variable will be updated  to  have
          the same value.  <STRONG>Tcl_LinkVar</STRONG> normally returns TCL_OK;  if an
          error occurs while setting up the link (e.g. because <EM>varName</EM>
          is  the  name  of  array)  then  TCL_ERROR  is  returned and
          <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM> contains an error message.

          The <EM>type</EM> argument specifies the type of the C variable,  and
          must have one of the following values, optionally OR'ed with
          TCL_LINK_READ_ONLY:

          <STRONG>TCL_LINK_INT</STRONG>
               The C variable is of type <STRONG>int</STRONG>.  Any value written  into
               the  Tcl  variable  must  have  a  proper  integer form
               acceptable  to  <STRONG>Tcl_GetInt</STRONG>;   attempts  to  write  non-
               integer  values  into <EM>varName</EM> will be rejected with Tcl
               errors.

          <STRONG>TCL_LINK_DOUBLE</STRONG>
               The C variable is of type <STRONG>double</STRONG>.   Any  value  written
               into  the  Tcl  variable  must  have a proper real form
               acceptable to <STRONG>Tcl_GetDouble</STRONG>;  attempts  to  write  non-
               real  values  into  <EM>varName</EM>  will  be rejected with Tcl
               errors.

          <STRONG>TCL_LINK_BOOLEAN</STRONG>
               The C variable is of type <STRONG>int</STRONG>.  If its  value  is  zero
               then  it will read from Tcl as ``0''; otherwise it will
               read from Tcl as ``1''.  Whenver <EM>varName</EM>  is  modified,
               the  C  variable  will  be  set to a 0 or 1 value.  Any
               value written into the Tcl variable must have a  proper
               boolean form acceptable to <STRONG>Tcl_GetBoolean</STRONG>;  attempts to
               write non-boolean values into <EM>varName</EM> will be  rejected
               with Tcl errors.

          <STRONG>TCL_LINK_STRING</STRONG>
               The C variable is of type <STRONG>char</STRONG> <STRONG>*</STRONG>.  If its value is  not
               null  then  it  must be a pointer to a string allocated
               with <STRONG>malloc</STRONG>.  Whenever the Tcl variable is modified the
               current  C  string will be freed and new memory will be
               allocated to hold a copy of the variable's  new  value.
               If  the C variable contains a null pointer then the Tcl
               variable will read as ``NULL''.

          If the TCL_LINK_READ_ONLY flag is present in <EM>type</EM>  then  the
          variable  will  be read-only from Tcl, so that its value can
          only be changed by modifying the C  variable.   Attempts  to
          write the variable from Tcl will be rejected with errors.
