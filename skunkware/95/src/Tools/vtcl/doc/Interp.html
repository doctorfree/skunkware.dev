          Tcl_Interp - client-visible fields of interpreter structures

     <STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>
          <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;tcl.h&gt;</STRONG>

          typedef struct {
               char *<EM>result</EM>;
               Tcl_FreeProc *<EM>freeProc</EM>;
               int <EM>errorLine</EM>;
          } Tcl_Interp;

          typedef void Tcl_FreeProc(char *<EM>blockPtr)</EM>;

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          The  <STRONG>Tcl_CreateInterp</STRONG>  procedure  returns  a  pointer  to  a
          Tcl_Interp  structure.   This  pointer  is  then passed into
          other Tcl procedures to process commands in the  interpreter
          and   perform   other   operations   on   the   interpreter.
          Interpreter structures contain many  many  fields  that  are
          used by Tcl, but only three that may be accessed by clients:
          <EM>result</EM>, <EM>freeProc</EM>, and <EM>errorLine</EM>.

          The <EM>result</EM> and <EM>freeProc</EM> fields are used to return results or
          error  messages from commands.  This information is returned
          by command procedures back to <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>, and by <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG> back
          to  its callers.  The <EM>result</EM> field points to the string that
          represents the result or error  message,  and  the  <EM>freeProc</EM>
          field  tells  how  to  dispose of the storage for the string
          when it isn't needed anymore.  The easiest way  for  command
          procedures  to manipulate these fields is to call procedures
          like <STRONG>Tcl_SetResult</STRONG> or <STRONG>Tcl_AppendResult</STRONG>;  they will hide  all
          the  details  of managing the fields.  The description below
          is for those procedures that manipulate the fields directly.

          Whenever a command procedure returns, it  must  ensure  that
          the  <EM>result</EM>  field  of  its interpreter points to the string
          being returned by the command.  The <EM>result</EM> field must always
          point  to  a valid string.  If a command wishes to return no
          result then <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM> should point to an empty  string.
          Normally,  results  are  assumed to be statically allocated,
          which means that the contents will  not  change  before  the
          next time <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG> is called or some other command procedure
          is invoked.  In this case, the <EM>freeProc</EM> field must be  zero.
          Alternatively,  a command procedure may dynamically allocate
          its return value (e.g. using <STRONG>malloc</STRONG>) and store a pointer  to
          it  in  <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>.  In this case, the command procedure
          must also set <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>freeProc</EM> to the address of a procedure
          that can free the value (usually <STRONG>free</STRONG>).  If <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>freeProc</EM>
          is non-zero, then Tcl will call <EM>freeProc</EM> to free  the  space
          pointed  to  by  <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>  before  it invokes the next
          command.  If a client  procedure  overwrites  <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>
          when  <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>freeProc</EM>  is  non-zero, then it is responsible
          for calling <EM>freeProc</EM> to free  the  old  <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>  (the
          <STRONG>Tcl_FreeResult</STRONG> macro should be used for this purpose).

          <EM>FreeProc</EM> should have arguments and  result  that  match  the
          <STRONG>Tcl_FreeProc</STRONG>   declaration  above:   it  receives  a  single
          argument which is a pointer to the result value to free.  In
          most  applications <STRONG>free</STRONG> is the only non-zero value ever used
          for <EM>freeProc</EM>.  However, an application may store a different
          procedure  address  in <EM>freeProc</EM> in order to use an alternate
          memory allocator or in order to do other  cleanup  when  the
          result memory is freed.

          As part of processing  each  command,  <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>  initializes
          <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>  and <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>freeProc</EM> just before calling the
          command procedure for the command.  The <EM>freeProc</EM> field  will
          be  initialized to zero, and <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM> will point to an
          empty string.  Commands that do not  return  any  value  can
          simply  leave  the  fields  alone.   Furthermore,  the empty
          string pointed to by <EM>result</EM> is actually part of an array  of
          <STRONG>TCL_RESULT_SIZE</STRONG>   characters   (approximately  200).   If  a
          command wishes to return a short string, it can simply  copy
          it to the area pointed to by <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>.  Or, it can use
          the sprintf procedure to generate a short result  string  at
          the location pointed to by <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>.

          It is a general convention in  Tcl-based  applications  that
          the  result of an interpreter is normally in the initialized
          state described in the previous paragraph.  Procedures  that
          manipulate  an  interpreter's  result  (e.g. by returning an
          error) will  generally  assume  that  the  result  has  been
          initialized  when  the  procedure  is  called.   If  such  a
          procedure is to be called after the result has been changed,
          then  <STRONG>Tcl_ResetResult</STRONG>  should  be  called first to reset the
          result to its initialized state.

          The <EM>errorLine</EM> field is valid only after <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>  returns  a
          <STRONG>TCL_ERROR</STRONG>  return  code.   In  this  situation the <EM>errorLine</EM>
          field identifies  the  line  number  of  the  command  being
          executed  when  the  error  occurred.   The line numbers are
          relative to the command being executed:  1 means  the  first
          line  of  the command passed to <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>, 2 means the second
          line, and so on.  The <EM>errorLine</EM> field is typically  used  in
          conjunction  with  <STRONG>Tcl_AddErrorInfo</STRONG>  to  report  information
          about  where  an  error  occurred.   <EM>ErrorLine</EM>  should   not
          normally be modified except by <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>.
