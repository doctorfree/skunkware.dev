          <STRONG>Tcl_RecordAndEval</STRONG>(<EM>interp</EM>, <EM>cmd</EM>, <EM>eval)</EM>

                                            to evaluate command.

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          <STRONG>Tcl_RecordAndEval</STRONG> is invoked to record a command as an event
          on  the  history  list  and  then  execute it.  It returns a
          completion code such as TCL_OK just  like  <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>  and  it
          leaves information in <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>.  If you don't want the
          command recorded on the history list then you should  invoke
          <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>    instead    of    <STRONG>Tcl_RecordAndEval</STRONG>.     Normally
          <STRONG>Tcl_RecordAndEval</STRONG> is only  called  with  top-level  commands
          typed  by the user, since the purpose of history is to allow
          the user to re-issue recently-invoked commands.  If the <EM>eval</EM>
          argument is TCL_NO_EVAL then the command is recorded without
          being evaluated.
