     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          <STRONG>Tcl_CreateTrace</STRONG> arranges for command tracing.  From now  on,
          <EM>proc</EM>  will be invoked before Tcl calls command procedures to
          process  commands  in  <EM>interp</EM>.   The   return   value   from
          <STRONG>Tcl_CreateTrace</STRONG>  is  a  token  for  the  trace, which may be
          passed to <STRONG>Tcl_DeleteTrace</STRONG> to remove the trace.  There may be
          many  traces  in  effect simultaneously for the same command
          interpreter.

          <EM>Proc</EM> should have arguments and result that  match  the  type
          <STRONG>Tcl_CmdTraceProc</STRONG>:

               typedef void Tcl_CmdTraceProc(
                    ClientData <EM>clientData</EM>,
                    Tcl_Interp *<EM>interp</EM>,
                    int <EM>level</EM>,
                    char *<EM>command</EM>,
                    Tcl_CmdProc *<EM>cmdProc</EM>,
                    ClientData <EM>cmdClientData</EM>,
                    int <EM>argc</EM>,
                    char *<EM>argv</EM>[]));

          The <EM>clientData</EM> and  <EM>interp</EM>  parameters  are  copies  of  the
          corresponding    arguments    given    to   <STRONG>Tcl_CreateTrace</STRONG>.
          <EM>ClientData</EM> typically points to an application-specific  data
          structure  that  describes  what to do when <EM>proc</EM> is invoked.
          <EM>Level</EM> gives the nesting level of the  command  (1  for  top-
          level  commands passed to <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG> by the application, 2 for
          the next-level  commands  passed  to  <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>  as  part  of
          parsing  or  interpreting  level-1  commands,  and  so  on).
          <EM>Command</EM> points to  a  string  containing  the  text  of  the
          command, before any argument substitution.  <EM>CmdProc</EM> contains
          the address of the command procedure that will be called  to
          process the command (i.e. the <EM>proc</EM> argument of some previous
          call to <STRONG>Tcl_CreateCommand</STRONG>) and  <EM>cmdClientData</EM>  contains  the
          associated  client  data  for  <EM>cmdProc</EM> (the <EM>clientData</EM> value
          passed to <STRONG>Tcl_CreateCommand</STRONG>).  <EM>Argc</EM> and <EM>argv</EM> give the  final
          argument  information  that will be passed to <EM>cmdProc</EM>, after
          command, variable, and backslash  substitution.   <EM>Proc</EM>  must
          not modify the <EM>command</EM> or <EM>argv</EM> strings.

          Tracing will only occur for commands at nesting  level  less
          than  or  equal  to  the  <EM>level</EM>  parameter  (i.e.  the <EM>level</EM>
          parameter to <EM>proc</EM> will always be less than or equal  to  the
          <EM>level</EM> parameter to <STRONG>Tcl_CreateTrace</STRONG>).

          Calls to <EM>proc</EM> will be made by  the  Tcl  parser  immediately
          before  it  calls  the  command  procedure  for  the command
          (<EM>cmdProc)</EM>.   This  occurs   after   argument   parsing   and
          substitution,  so  tracing  for  substituted commands occurs
          before tracing of the commands containing the substitutions.
          If  there  is a syntax error in a command, or if there is no
          command procedure associated with a command  name,  then  no
          tracing  will occur for that command.  If a string passed to
          Tcl_Eval  contains  multiple  commands  (bracketed,  or   on
          different lines) then multiple calls to <EM>proc</EM> will occur, one
          for each command.  The <EM>command</EM>  string  for  each  of  these
          trace  calls  will  reflect  only  a single command, not the
          entire string passed to Tcl_Eval.

          <STRONG>Tcl_DeleteTrace</STRONG> removes a trace, so  that  no  future  calls
          will  be  made  to  the procedure associated with the trace.
          After <STRONG>Tcl_DeleteTrace</STRONG> returns, the caller should never again
          use the <EM>trace</EM> token.
