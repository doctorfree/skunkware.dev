     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          These procedures are used to manipulate two global variables
          that  hold information about errors.  The variable <STRONG>errorInfo</STRONG>
          holds a stack trace of the operations that were in  progress
          when  an  error  occurred,  and  is  intended  to  be human-
          readable.  The variable <STRONG>errorCode</STRONG> holds a list of items that
          are  intended  to  be  machine-readable.   The first item in
          <STRONG>errorCode</STRONG> identifies the class of error that occurred  (e.g.  |
          POSIX  means  an  error occurred in a POSIX system call) and
          additional elements in <STRONG>errorCode</STRONG> hold additional  pieces  of
          information  that depend on the class.  See the Tcl overview
          manual  entry  for  details  on  the  various  formats   for
          <STRONG>errorCode</STRONG>.

          The <STRONG>errorInfo</STRONG> variable is gradually built  up  as  an  error
          unwinds  through  the nested operations.  Each time an error
          code  is  returned  to  <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>  it  calls  the   procedure
          <STRONG>Tcl_AddErrorInfo</STRONG>   to   add  additional  text  to  <STRONG>errorInfo</STRONG>
          describing the command that  was  being  executed  when  the
          error  occurred.   By the time the error has been passed all
          the way back to the application, it will contain a  complete
          trace of the activity in progress when the error occurred.

          It is sometimes useful  to  add  additional  information  to
          <STRONG>errorInfo</STRONG>  beyond  what  can  be  supplied  automatically by
          <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>.  <STRONG>Tcl_AddErrorInfo</STRONG> may be used  for  this  purpose:
          its  <EM>message</EM>  argument  contains  an additional string to be
          appended to <STRONG>errorInfo</STRONG>.   For  example,  the  <STRONG>source</STRONG>  command
          calls  <STRONG>Tcl_AddErrorInfo</STRONG> to record the name of the file being
          processed and the line number on which the  error  occurred;
          for  Tcl  procedures,  the  procedure  name  and line number
          within the procedure are recorded, and so on.  The best time
          to call <STRONG>Tcl_AddErrorInfo</STRONG> is just after <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG> has returned
          <STRONG>TCL_ERROR</STRONG>.  In calling <STRONG>Tcl_AddErrorInfo</STRONG>,  you  may  find  it
          useful  to  use  the <STRONG>errorLine</STRONG> field of the interpreter (see
          the <STRONG>Tcl_Interp</STRONG> manual entry for details).

          The procedure <STRONG>Tcl_SetErrorCode</STRONG> is used to set the  <STRONG>errorCode</STRONG>
          variable.  Its <EM>element</EM> arguments give one or more strings to
          record in <STRONG>errorCode</STRONG>:  each <EM>element</EM> will become one item of a
          properly-formed    Tcl    list    stored    in    <STRONG>errorCode</STRONG>.
          <STRONG>Tcl_SetErrorCode</STRONG> is typically invoked just before  returning
          an   error.    If  an  error  is  returned  without  calling
          <STRONG>Tcl_SetErrorCode</STRONG> then the Tcl interpreter automatically sets
          <STRONG>errorCode</STRONG> to <STRONG>NONE</STRONG>.

          <STRONG>Tcl_PosixError</STRONG> sets the <STRONG>errorCode</STRONG> variable after an error in  |
          a  POSIX  kernel  call.   It  reads the value of the <STRONG>errno</STRONG> C  |
          variable and calls <STRONG>Tcl_SetErrorCode</STRONG> to set <STRONG>errorCode</STRONG> in  the  |
          <STRONG>POSIX</STRONG>  format.  In addition, <STRONG>Tcl_PosixError</STRONG> returns a human-  |
          readable diagnostic message for the error (this is the  same
          value  that  will appear as the third element in <STRONG>errorCode</STRONG>).
          It may be convenient to include this string as part  of  the
          error message returned to the application in <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>.

          It is important to call the procedures described here rather
          than   setting   <STRONG>errorInfo</STRONG>   or   <STRONG>errorCode</STRONG>   directly  with
          <STRONG>Tcl_SetVar</STRONG>.  The reason for this is that the Tcl interpreter
          keeps  information  about whether these procedures have been
          called.  For example, the  first  time  <STRONG>Tcl_AppendResult</STRONG>  is
          called  for  an  error,  it  clears  the  existing  value of
          <STRONG>errorInfo</STRONG> and adds the error message  in  <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>  to
          the variable before appending <EM>message</EM>;  in subsequent calls,
          it just appends the new <EM>message</EM>.  When  <STRONG>Tcl_SetErrorCode</STRONG>  is
          called,  it  sets  a flag indicating that <STRONG>errorCode</STRONG> has been
          set;  this allows the Tcl interpreter to  set  <STRONG>errorCode</STRONG>  to
          <STRONG>NONE</STRONG>  <STRONG>if</STRONG>  <STRONG>it</STRONG>  <STRONG>receives</STRONG> <STRONG>an</STRONG> <STRONG>error</STRONG> <STRONG>return</STRONG> <STRONG>when</STRONG> <STRONG>Tcl_SetErrorCode</STRONG>
          hasn't been called.

          If the procedure <STRONG>Tcl_ResetResult</STRONG> is called, it clears all of
          the  state  associated  with <STRONG>errorInfo</STRONG> and <STRONG>errorCode</STRONG> (but it
          doesn't actually modify the variables).   If  an  error  had
          occurred,  this will clear the error state to make it appear
          as if no error had occurred after all.
