     _________________________________________________________________


     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          <STRONG>Tcl_CreateCommand</STRONG>  defines  a  new  command  in  <EM>interp</EM>  and
          associates it with procedure <EM>proc</EM> such that whenever <EM>cmdName</EM>
          is invoked as a Tcl command (via a call to <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>) the Tcl
          interpreter will call <EM>proc</EM> to process the command.  If there
          is  already  a   command   <EM>cmdName</EM>   associated   with   the
          interpreter,  it is deleted.  <EM>Proc</EM> should have arguments and
          result that match the type <STRONG>Tcl_CmdProc</STRONG>:
               typedef int Tcl_CmdProc(
                    ClientData <EM>clientData</EM>,
                    Tcl_Interp *<EM>interp</EM>,
                    int <EM>argc</EM>,
                    char *<EM>argv</EM>[]);
          When <EM>proc</EM> is invoked the <EM>clientData</EM>  and  <EM>interp</EM>  parameters
          will  be copies of the <EM>clientData</EM> and <EM>interp</EM> arguments given
          to <STRONG>Tcl_CreateCommand</STRONG>.  Typically, <EM>clientData</EM>  points  to  an
          application-specific  data  structure that describes what to
          do when the command procedure is  invoked.   <EM>Argc</EM>  and  <EM>argv</EM>
          describe  the  arguments  to  the  command,  <EM>argc</EM> giving the
          number of arguments (including the command  name)  and  <EM>argv</EM>
          giving  the  values  of  the arguments as strings.  The <EM>argv</EM>
          array will contain <EM>argc</EM>+1  values;  the  first  <EM>argc</EM>  values
          point to the argument strings, and the last value is NULL.

          <EM>Proc</EM> must return an integer  code  that  is  either  <STRONG>TCL_OK</STRONG>,
          <STRONG>TCL_ERROR</STRONG>,  <STRONG>TCL_RETURN</STRONG>, <STRONG>TCL_BREAK</STRONG>, or <STRONG>TCL_CONTINUE</STRONG>.  See the
          Tcl overview man page for details on what these codes  mean.
          Most  normal  commands will only return <STRONG>TCL_OK</STRONG> or <STRONG>TCL_ERROR</STRONG>.
          In addition, <EM>proc</EM> must set  <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>  to  point  to  a
          string value; in the case of a <STRONG>TCL_OK</STRONG> return code this gives
          the result of the command, and in the case of  <STRONG>TCL_ERROR</STRONG>  it
          gives   an   error  message.   The  <STRONG>Tcl_SetResult</STRONG>  procedure
          provides an easy interface for  setting  the  return  value;
          for  complete  details  on  how  the <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM> field is
          managed, see the <STRONG>Tcl_Interp</STRONG> man  page.   Before  invoking  a
          command  procedure, <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG> sets <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM> to point to
          an empty string, so simple  commands  can  return  an  empty
          result by doing nothing at all.

          The contents of the <EM>argv</EM> array belong to  Tcl  and  are  not  |
          guaranteed  to  persist  once <EM>proc</EM> returns:  <EM>proc</EM> should not  |
          modify them, nor  should  it  set  <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>  to  point  |
          anywhere  within  the  <EM>argv</EM> values.  Call <STRONG>Tcl_SetResult</STRONG> with  |
          status <STRONG>TCL_VOLATILE</STRONG> if you want to return something from the  |
          <EM>argv</EM> array.

          <EM>DeleteProc</EM> will be invoked when  (if)  <EM>cmdName</EM>  is  deleted.
          This  can  occur  through  a  call  to  <STRONG>Tcl_DeleteCommand</STRONG> or
          <STRONG>Tcl_DeleteInterp</STRONG>, or by replacing <EM>cmdName</EM> in another call to
          <STRONG>Tcl_CreateCommand</STRONG>.  <EM>DeleteProc</EM> is invoked before the command
          is deleted, and gives  the  application  an  opportunity  to
          release   any   structures   associated  with  the  command.
          <EM>DeleteProc</EM> should have arguments and result that  match  the
          type <STRONG>Tcl_CmdDeleteProc</STRONG>:

               typedef void Tcl_CmdDeleteProc(ClientData <EM>clientData)</EM>;

          The <EM>clientData</EM> argument will be the same as  the  <EM>clientData</EM>
          argument passed to <STRONG>Tcl_CreateCommand</STRONG>.

          <STRONG>Tcl_DeleteCommand</STRONG>  deletes  a   command   from   a   command
          interpreter.   Once  the  call completes, attempts to invoke
          <EM>cmdName</EM> in <EM>interp</EM> will result in errors.  If  <EM>cmdName</EM>  isn't
          bound  as  a  command  in <EM>interp</EM> then <STRONG>Tcl_DeleteCommand</STRONG> does
          nothing and returns -1;  otherwise it returns 0.  There  are
          no  restrictions  on  <EM>cmdName</EM>:   it  may refer to a built-in
          command,  an  application-specific   command,   or   a   Tcl
          procedure.

          <STRONG>Tcl_GetCommandInfo</STRONG>  checks  to  see  whether   its   <EM>cmdName</EM>  |
          argument  exists  as  a  command  in <EM>interp</EM>.  If not then it  |
          returns  0.   Otherwise  it  places  information  about  the  |
          command  in  the structure pointed to by <EM>infoPtr</EM> and returns  |
          1.   Tcl_CmdInfo  structures   have   fields   named   <EM>proc</EM>,  |
          <EM>clientData</EM>,  and  <EM>deleteProc</EM>, which have the same meaning as  |
          the corresponding arguments to <STRONG>Tcl_CreateCommand</STRONG>.  There  is  |
          also  a  field  <EM>deleteData</EM>, which is the ClientData value to  |
          pass to <EM>deleteProc</EM>;  it is normally the same  as  <EM>clientData</EM>  |
          but  may  be  set independently using the <STRONG>Tcl_SetCommandInfo</STRONG>  |
          procedure.                                                    |

          <STRONG>Tcl_SetCommandInfo</STRONG> is used  to  modify  the  procedures  and  |
          ClientData  values  associated  with a command.  Its <EM>cmdName</EM>  |
          argument is the name  of  a  command  in  <EM>interp</EM>.   If  this  |
          command    exists   then   <STRONG>Tcl_SetCommandInfo</STRONG>   returns   0.  |
          Otherwise, it copies the information from *<EM>infoPtr</EM> to  Tcl's  |
          internal structure for the command and returns 1.  Note that  |
          this  procedure  allows  the  ClientData  for  a   command's  |
          deletion  procedure  to  be given a different value than the  |
          ClientData for its command procedure.
