     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          These four procedures all evaluate an expression,  returning
          the  result  in one of four different forms.  The expression
          is given by the <EM>string</EM> argument, and it can have any of  the
          forms  accepted  by  the  <STRONG>expr</STRONG> command.  The <EM>interp</EM> argument
          refers to an interpreter used  to  evaluate  the  expression
          (e.g.  for  variables and nested Tcl commands) and to return
          error  information.   <EM>Interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>  is   assumed   to   be
          initialized   in  the  standard  fashion  when  any  of  the
          procedures are invoked.

          For all of these procedures the return value is  a  standard
          Tcl  result:   <STRONG>TCL_OK</STRONG>  means  the expression was succesfully
          evaluated, and <STRONG>TCL_ERROR</STRONG> means that an error occurred  while
          evaluating  the  expression.   If <STRONG>TCL_ERROR</STRONG> is returned then
          <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM> will hold a message describing the error.  If
          an  error  occurs  while executing a Tcl command embedded in
          the expression then that error will be returned.

          If the expression is successfully evaluated, then its  value
          is  returned  in  one  of  four  forms,  depending  on which
          procedure is invoked.  <STRONG>Tcl_ExprLong</STRONG> stores an integer  value
          at   *<EM>longPtr</EM>.   If  the  expression's  actual  value  is  a
          floating-point number, then it is truncated to  an  integer.
          If  the  expression's  actual  value is a non-numeric string
          then an error is returned.

          <STRONG>Tcl_ExprDouble</STRONG> stores a floating-point value at  *<EM>doublePtr</EM>.
          If  the  expression's  actual  value  is  an  integer, it is
          converted to floating-point.   If  the  expression's  actual
          value is a non-numeric string then an error is returned.

          <STRONG>Tcl_ExprBoolean</STRONG> stores a 0/1 integer value  at  *<EM>booleanPtr</EM>.
          If  the expression's actual value is an integer or floating-
          point number, then <STRONG>Tcl_ExprBoolean</STRONG> stores 0  at  *<EM>booleanPtr</EM>
          if  the value was zero and 1 otherwise.  If the expression's  |
          actual value is a non-numeric string then it must be one  of  |
          the  values  accepted  by <STRONG>Tcl_GetBoolean</STRONG>, such as ``yes'' or  |
          ``no'', or else an error occurs.

          <STRONG>Tcl_ExprString</STRONG> returns the value  of  the  expression  as  a
          string stored in <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>.  If the expression's actual  |
          value is an integer then <STRONG>Tcl_ExprString</STRONG>  converts  it  to  a  |
          string  using  <STRONG>sprintf</STRONG>  with  a  ``%d''  converter.   If the  |
          expression's actual value is a floating-point  number,  then  |
          <STRONG>Tcl_ExprString</STRONG>  calls  <STRONG>Tcl_PrintDouble</STRONG>  to  convert  it to a  |
          string.
