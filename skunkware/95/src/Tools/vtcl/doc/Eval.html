     _________________________________________________________________


     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          All four of these procedures execute Tcl commands.  <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>
          is  the  core  procedure:   it  parses commands from <EM>cmd</EM> and
          executes them in order until either an error  occurs  or  it  |
          reaches  the  end  of  the  string.   The  return value from
          <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG> is one of the Tcl return codes  <STRONG>TCL_OK</STRONG>,  <STRONG>TCL_ERROR</STRONG>,
          <STRONG>TCL_RETURN</STRONG>,  <STRONG>TCL_BREAK</STRONG>,  or <STRONG>TCL_CONTINUE</STRONG>, and <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>
          will point to a string with additional  information  (result
          value   or   error   message).    This   return  information
          corresponds to the last command executed from <EM>cmd</EM>.

          <STRONG>Tcl_VarEval</STRONG> takes any number  of  string  arguments  of  any
          length,  concatenates  them into a single string, then calls
          <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG> to execute  that  string  as  a  Tcl  command.   It
          returns  the result of the command and also modifies <EM>interp</EM>-
          &gt;<EM>result</EM> in the usual fashion for  Tcl  commands.   The  last
          argument  to <STRONG>Tcl_VarEval</STRONG> must be NULL to indicate the end of
          arguments.

          <STRONG>Tcl_EvalFile</STRONG> reads the file given by <EM>fileName</EM> and  evaluates
          its  contents  as  a  Tcl  command  by calling <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>.  It
          returns a standard Tcl result that reflects  the  result  of
          evaluating  the  file.   If the file couldn't be read then a
          Tcl error is returned to describe why the file  couldn't  be
          read.

          <STRONG>Tcl_GlobalEval</STRONG>  is  similar  to  <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>  except  that   it
          processes  the command at global level.  This means that the
          variable  context  for  the  command  consists   of   global
          variables  only  (it  ignores  any  Tcl  procedure  that  is
          active).  This produces an effect similar to the Tcl command
          ``<STRONG>uplevel</STRONG> <STRONG>0</STRONG>''.

          During the processing of a Tcl command it is legal  to  make
          nested  calls  to  evaluate  other  commands  (this  is  how
          conditionals, loops, and procedures are implemented).  If  a
          code  other  than  <STRONG>TCL_OK</STRONG> is returned from a nested <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>
          invocation,  then  the   caller   should   normally   return
          immediately,  passing  that  same  return  code  back to its
          caller,  and  so  on  until  the  top-level  application  is
          reached.   A  few commands, like <STRONG>for</STRONG>, will check for certain
          return codes, like <STRONG>TCL_BREAK</STRONG> and <STRONG>TCL_CONTINUE</STRONG>,  and  process
          them specially without returning.

          <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG> keeps track of how many nested Tcl_Eval invocations
          are  in  progress  for  <EM>interp</EM>.   If  a  code of <STRONG>TCL_RETURN</STRONG>,
          <STRONG>TCL_BREAK</STRONG>, or <STRONG>TCL_CONTINUE</STRONG> is about to be returned from  the
          topmost   <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>  invocation  for  <EM>interp</EM>,  then  <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>
          converts the return  code  to  <STRONG>TCL_ERROR</STRONG>  and  sets  <EM>interp</EM>-
          &gt;<EM>result</EM>  to  point  to  an error message indicating that the
          <STRONG>return</STRONG>,  <STRONG>break</STRONG>,  or  <STRONG>continue</STRONG>  command  was  invoked  in  an
          inappropriate place.  This means that top-level applications
          should never see a return  code  from  <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>  other  then
          <STRONG>TCL_OK</STRONG> or <STRONG>TCL_ERROR</STRONG>.
