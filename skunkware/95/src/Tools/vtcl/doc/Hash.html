     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          A hash table consists of zero or more entries, each
          consisting of a key and a value.  Given the key for an
          entry, the hashing routines can very quickly locate the
          entry, and hence its value.  There may be at most one entry
          in a hash table with a particular key, but many entries may
          have the same value.  Keys can take one of three forms:
          strings, one-word values, or integer arrays.  All of the
          keys in a given table have the same form, which is specified
          when the table is initialized.

          The value of a hash table entry can be anything that fits in
          the same space as a ``char *'' pointer.  Values for hash
          table entries are managed entirely by clients, not by the
          hash module itself.  Typically each entry's value is a
          pointer to a data structure managed by client code.

          Hash tables grow gracefully as the number of entries
          increases, so that there are always less than three entries
          per hash bucket, on average.  This allows for fast lookups
          regardless of the number of entries in a table.

          <STRONG>Tcl_InitHashTable</STRONG> initializes a structure that describes a
          new hash table.  The space for the structure is provided by
          the caller, not by the hash module.  The value of <EM>keyType</EM>
          indicates what kinds of keys will be used for all entries in
          the table.  <EM>KeyType</EM> must have one of the following values:

          <STRONG>TCL_STRING_KEYS</STRONG>          Keys are null-terminated ASCII
                                   strings.  They are passed to
                                   hashing routines using the address
                                   of the first character of the
                                   string.

          <STRONG>TCL_ONE_WORD_KEYS</STRONG>        Keys are single-word values;  they
                                   are passed to hashing routines and
                                   stored in hash table entries as
                                   ``char *'' values.  The pointer
                                   value is the key;  it need not (and
                                   usually doesn't) actually point to
                                   a string.

          <EM>other</EM>                    If <EM>keyType</EM> is not TCL_STRING_KEYS
                                   or TCL_ONE_WORD_KEYS, then it must
                                   be an integer value greater than 1.
                                   In this case the keys will be
                                   arrays of ``int'' values, where
                                   <EM>keyType</EM> gives the number of ints in
                                   each key.  This allows structures
                                   to be used as keys.  All keys must
                                   have the same size.  Array keys are
                                   passed into hashing functions using
                                   the address of the first int in the
                                   array.

          <STRONG>Tcl_DeleteHashTable</STRONG> deletes all of the entries in a hash
          table and frees up the memory associated with the table's
          bucket array and entries.  It does not free the actual table
          structure (pointed to by <EM>tablePtr)</EM>, since that memory is
          assumed to be managed by the client.  <STRONG>Tcl_DeleteHashTable</STRONG>
          also does not free or otherwise manipulate the values of the
          hash table entries.  If the entry values point to
          dynamically-allocated memory, then it is the client's
          responsibility to free these structures before deleting the
          table.
          <STRONG>Tcl_CreateHashEntry</STRONG> locates the entry corresponding to a
          particular key, creating a new entry in the table if there
          wasn't already one with the given key.  If an entry already
          existed with the given key then *<EM>newPtr</EM> is set to zero.  If
          a new entry was created, then *<EM>newPtr</EM> is set to a non-zero
          value and the value of the new entry will be set to zero.
          The return value from <STRONG>Tcl_CreateHashEntry</STRONG> is a pointer to
          the entry, which may be used to retrieve and modify the
          entry's value or to delete the entry from the table.

          <STRONG>Tcl_DeleteHashEntry</STRONG> will remove an existing entry from a
          table.  The memory associated with the entry itself will be
          freed, but the client is responsible for any cleanup
          associated with the entry's value, such as freeing a
          structure that it points to.

          <STRONG>Tcl_FindHashEntry</STRONG> is similar to <STRONG>Tcl_CreateHashEntry</STRONG> except
          that it doesn't create a new entry if the key doesn't exist;
          instead, it returns NULL as result.

          <STRONG>Tcl_GetHashValue</STRONG> and <STRONG>Tcl_SetHashValue</STRONG> are used to read and
          write an entry's value, respectively.  Values are stored and
          retrieved as type ``ClientData'', which is large enough to
          hold a pointer value.  On almost all machines this is large
          enough to hold an integer value too.

          <STRONG>Tcl_GetHashKey</STRONG> returns the key for a given hash table entry,
          either as a pointer to a string, a one-word (``char *'')
          key, or as a pointer to the first word of an array of
          integers, depending on the <EM>keyType</EM> used to create a hash
          table.  In all cases <STRONG>Tcl_GetHashKey</STRONG> returns a result with
          type ``char *''.  When the key is a string or array, the
          result of <STRONG>Tcl_GetHashKey</STRONG> points to information in the table
          entry;  this information will remain valid until the entry
          is deleted or its table is deleted.

          <STRONG>Tcl_FirstHashEntry</STRONG> and <STRONG>Tcl_NextHashEntry</STRONG> may be used to scan
          all of the entries in a hash table.  A structure of type
          ``Tcl_HashSearch'', provided by the client, is used to keep
          track of progress through the table.  <STRONG>Tcl_FirstHashEntry</STRONG>
          initializes the search record and returns the first entry in
          the table (or NULL if the table is empty).  Each susequent
          call to <STRONG>Tcl_NextHashEntry</STRONG> returns the next entry in the
          table or NULL if the end of the table has been reached.  A
          call to <STRONG>Tcl_FirstHashEntry</STRONG> followed by calls to
          <STRONG>Tcl_NextHashEntry</STRONG> will return each of the entries in the
          table exactly once, in an arbitrary order.  It is
          unadvisable to modify the structure of the table, e.g.  by
          creating or deleting entries, while the search is in
          progress.

          <STRONG>Tcl_HashStats</STRONG> returns a dynamically-allocated string with
          overall information about a hash table, such as the number
          of entries it contains, the number of buckets in its hash
          array, and the utilization of the buckets.  It is the
          caller's responsibility to free the result string by passing
          it to <STRONG>free</STRONG>.

          The header file <STRONG>tcl.h</STRONG> defines the actual data structures
          used to implement hash tables.  This is necessary so that
          clients can allocate Tcl_HashTable structures and so that
          macros can be used to read and write the values of entries.
          However, users of the hashing routines should never refer
          directly to any of the fields of any of the hash-related
          data structures; use the procedures and macros defined here.
