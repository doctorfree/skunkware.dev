          Tcl_Interp   *<EM>interp</EM>      (out)     Interpreter to  use  for
                                              error reporting.

          char         *<EM>list</EM>        (in)      Pointer to a string with
                                              proper list structure.

          int          *<EM>argcPtr</EM>     (out)     Filled in with number of
                                              elements in <EM>list</EM>.

          char         ***<EM>argvPtr</EM>   (out)     *<EM>argvPtr</EM> will be  filled
                                              in  with  the address of
                                              an array of pointers  to
                                              the strings that are the
                                              extracted  elements   of
                                              <EM>list</EM>.    There  will  be
                                              *<EM>argcPtr</EM>  valid  entries
                                              in  the  array, followed
                                              by a NULL entry.

          int          <EM>argc</EM>         (in)      Number  of  elements  in
                                              <EM>argv</EM>.

                                              single    list.     Each
                                              string   will  become  a
                                              separate element of  the
                                              list.

          char         *<EM>src</EM>         (in)      String that is to become

                                              about <EM>src</EM>.  The value of
                                              *<EM>flagsPtr</EM> must be passed
                                              to <STRONG>Tcl_ConvertElement</STRONG>.

          char         *<EM>dst</EM>         (in)      Place to copy  converted
                                              list    element.    Must
                                              contain           enough
                                              characters    to    hold
                                              converted string.

          int          <EM>flags</EM>        (in)      Information  about  <EM>src</EM>.

                                              by  previous   call   to
                                              <STRONG>Tcl_ScanElement</STRONG>,
                                              possibly   OR-ed    with

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          These procedures may be used to disassemble  and  reassemble
          Tcl   lists.   <STRONG>Tcl_SplitList</STRONG>  breaks  a  list  up  into  its
          constituent elements, returning an array of pointers to  the
          elements  using  <EM>argcPtr</EM>  and <EM>argvPtr</EM>.  While extracting the
          arguments, <STRONG>Tcl_SplitList</STRONG> obeys the usual rules for backslash
          substitutions  and braces.  The area of memory pointed to by
          *<EM>argvPtr</EM> is dynamically allocated;  in addition to the array
          of  pointers, it also holds copies of all the list elements.
          It is the caller's responsibility to free  up  all  of  this
          storage.    For   example,  suppose  that  you  have  called
          <STRONG>Tcl_SplitList</STRONG> with the following code:

               int argc, code;
               char *string;
               char **argv;
               ...
               code = Tcl_SplitList(interp, string, &amp;argc, &amp;argv);
9          Then you should eventually free the storage with a call like
          the following:

               free((char *) argv);
9
          <STRONG>Tcl_SplitList</STRONG> normally returns <STRONG>TCL_OK</STRONG>, which means the  list
          was  successfully  parsed.   If  there was a syntax error in
          <EM>list</EM>, then <STRONG>TCL_ERROR</STRONG> is  returned  and  <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>  will
          point  to  an  error  message  describing  the  problem.  If
          <STRONG>TCL_ERROR</STRONG> is  returned  then  no  memory  is  allocated  and


          <STRONG>Tcl_Merge</STRONG> is the  inverse  of  <STRONG>Tcl_SplitList</STRONG>:   it  takes  a
          collection of strings given by <EM>argc</EM> and <EM>argv</EM> and generates a
          result string that has proper list  structure.   This  means
          that commands like <STRONG>index</STRONG> may be used to extract the original
          elements again.  In addition, if the result of <STRONG>Tcl_Merge</STRONG>  is
          passed  to <STRONG>Tcl_Eval</STRONG>, it will be parsed into <EM>argc</EM> words whose
          values will be the  same  as  the  <EM>argv</EM>  strings  passed  to
          <STRONG>Tcl_Merge</STRONG>.   <STRONG>Tcl_Merge</STRONG>  will  modify  the list elements with
          braces and/or backslashes in order  to  produce  proper  Tcl
          list  structure.  The result string is dynamically allocated
          using <STRONG>malloc()</STRONG>;  the  caller  must  eventually  release  the
          space using <STRONG>free()</STRONG>.

          If the result of <STRONG>Tcl_Merge</STRONG> is passed to  <STRONG>Tcl_SplitList</STRONG>,  the
          elements  returned  by  <STRONG>Tcl_SplitList</STRONG>  will  be identical to
          those passed into <STRONG>Tcl_Merge</STRONG>.  However, the converse  is  not
          true:   if  <STRONG>Tcl_SplitList</STRONG>  is passed a given string, and the
          resulting  <EM>argc</EM>  and  <EM>argv</EM>  are  passed  to  <STRONG>Tcl_Merge</STRONG>,  the
          resulting  string may not be the same as the original string
          passed to <STRONG>Tcl_SplitList</STRONG>.  This is because <STRONG>Tcl_Merge</STRONG> may  use
          backslashes and braces differently than the original string.

          <STRONG>Tcl_ScanElement</STRONG> and <STRONG>Tcl_ConvertElement</STRONG>  are  the  procedures
          that  do all of the real work of <STRONG>Tcl_Merge</STRONG>.  <STRONG>Tcl_ScanElement</STRONG>
          scans its <EM>src</EM> argument and determines how to use backslashes
          and braces when converting it to a list element.  It returns
          an overestimate of the  number  of  characters  required  to
          represent  <EM>src</EM>  as a list element, and it stores information
          in *<EM>flagsPtr</EM> that is needed by <STRONG>Tcl_ConvertElement</STRONG>.

          <STRONG>Tcl_ConvertElement</STRONG>   is    a    companion    procedure    to
          <STRONG>Tcl_ScanElement</STRONG>.   It  does  the actual work of converting a
          string to a list element.  Its <EM>flags</EM> argument  must  be  the
          same    as    the   value   returned   by   <STRONG>Tcl_ScanElement</STRONG>.
          <STRONG>Tcl_ConvertElement</STRONG> writes a proper list  element  to  memory
          starting  at *<EM>dst</EM> and returns a count of the total number of
          characters written, which will be no more  than  the  result
          returned  by <STRONG>Tcl_ScanElement</STRONG>.  <STRONG>Tcl_ConvertElement</STRONG> writes out
          only the actual list element without any leading or trailing
          spaces:  it  is  up  to the caller to include spaces between
          adjacent list elements.

          <STRONG>Tcl_ConvertElement</STRONG> uses one of two different  approaches  to
          handle the special characters in <EM>src</EM>.  Wherever possible, it
          handles special characters by surrounding  the  string  with
          braces.   This  produces  clean-looking output, but can't be
          used in some situations, such as when <EM>src</EM> contains unmatched
          braces.   In  these  situations,  <STRONG>Tcl_ConvertElement</STRONG> handles
          special characters by  generating  backslash  sequences  for
          them.   The  caller may insist on the second approach by OR-

          <STRONG>TCL_DONT_USE_BRACES</STRONG>.   Although  this will produce an uglier
          result, it is useful in some  special  situations,  such  as
          when  <STRONG>Tcl_ConvertElement</STRONG> is being used to generate a portion
          of an argument for a Tcl command.  In this case, surrounding
          <EM>src</EM>  with  curly  braces  would  cause the command not to be
          parsed correctly.
