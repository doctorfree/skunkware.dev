     <STRONG>NAME</STRONG>
          Tcl_AppInit - Perform application-specific initialization

     <STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>
          <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;tcl.h&gt;</STRONG>

          <STRONG>Tcl_AppInit</STRONG>(<EM>interp)</EM>

     <STRONG>ARGUMENTS</STRONG>
          Tcl_Interp   *<EM>interp</EM>   (in)      Interpreter     for     the
                                           application.

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          <STRONG>Tcl_AppInit</STRONG> is a procedure  that  is  invoked  by  the  main
          programs  for  Tcl applications such as <STRONG>tclsh</STRONG> and <STRONG>wish</STRONG>.  Its
          purpose is to allow  new  Tcl  applications  to  be  created
          without  modifying  existing main programs such as those for
          <STRONG>tclsh</STRONG> and <STRONG>wish</STRONG>.  To create a new application simply write  a
          new  version  of  <STRONG>Tcl_AppInit</STRONG> to replace the default version
          provided by Tcl, then link your new <STRONG>Tcl_AppInit</STRONG> with the Tcl
          library, which contains the main program from <STRONG>tclsh</STRONG> (be sure
          to specify the switch ``<STRONG>-u</STRONG> <STRONG>_main</STRONG>'' to the linker to force it
          to use the version of <STRONG>main</STRONG> from the Tcl library).

          <STRONG>Tcl_AppInit</STRONG> is invoked after other  initialization  in  <STRONG>main</STRONG>
          and before entering the main loop to process commands.  Here
          are some examples of things that <STRONG>Tcl_AppInit</STRONG> might do:

          [1]  Call initialization  procedures  for  various  packages
               used by the application.  Each initialization procedure
               adds  new  commands  to  <EM>interp</EM>  for  its  package  and
               performs other package-specific initialization.

          [2]  Process command-line arguments, which can  be  accessed
               from the Tcl variables <STRONG>argv</STRONG> and <STRONG>argv0</STRONG> in <EM>interp</EM>.

          [3]  Invoke a startup script to initialize the application.
