     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          These procedures may be used to create,  modify,  read,  and
          delete   Tcl   variables   from   C  code.   <STRONG>Tcl_SetVar</STRONG>  and
          <STRONG>Tcl_SetVar2</STRONG> will create a new variable or modify an existing
          one.  Both of these procedures set the given variable to the
          value given by <EM>newValue</EM>, and they return a pointer to a copy
          of  the  variable's  new  value,  which  is  stored in Tcl's
          variable  structure.   Tcl  keeps  a  private  copy  of  the
          variable's  value,  so  the caller may change <EM>newValue</EM> after
          these procedures return without affecting the value  of  the
          variable.   If an error occurs in setting the variable (e.g.
          an array variable is referenced without giving an index into
          the array), then NULL is returned.

          The name of the variable may be specified in either  of  two
          ways.   If  <STRONG>Tcl_SetVar</STRONG> is called, the variable name is given
          as a single string, <EM>varName</EM>.  If <EM>varName</EM>  contains  an  open
          parenthesis  and  ends  with  a  close parenthesis, then the
          value between the parentheses is treated as an index  (which
          can  have  any  string  value) and the characters before the
          first open parenthesis are treated as the name of  an  array
          variable.   If <EM>varName</EM> doesn't have parentheses as described
          above, then the entire string is treated as the  name  of  a
          scalar  variable.   If <STRONG>Tcl_SetVar2</STRONG> is called, then the array
          name and index have been separated by the  caller  into  two
          separate strings, <EM>name1</EM> and <EM>name2</EM> respectively;  if <EM>name2</EM> is
          zero it means that a scalar variable is being referenced.

          The <EM>flags</EM> argument may be used to  specify  any  of  several
          options   to  the  procedures.   It  consists  of  an  OR-ed
          combination of any of the following bits:

          TCL_GLOBAL_ONLY
               Under  normal  circumstances  the  procedures  look  up
               variables  at  the  current level of procedure call for
               <EM>interp</EM>, or at global level if there is no call  active.
               However,  if this bit is set in <EM>flags</EM> then the variable
               is looked up  at  global  level  even  if  there  is  a
               procedure call active.

          TCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG
               If an error is returned and this bit is set  in  <EM>flags</EM>,
               then  an  error message will be left in <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>.
               If this flag bit isn't set then  no  error  message  is
               left (<EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM> will not be modified).

          TCL_APPEND_VALUE
               If this bit is set then <EM>newValue</EM>  is  appended  to  the
               current   value,  instead  of  replacing  it.   If  the
               variable is  currently  undefined,  then  this  bit  is
               ignored.

          TCL_LIST_ELEMENT
               If this bit is set, then <EM>newValue</EM>  is  converted  to  a
               valid Tcl list element before setting (or appending to)
               the variable.  A separator space is appended before the
               new list element unless the list element is going to be  |
               the first element  in  a  list  or  sublist  (i.e.  the  |
               variable's  current  value  is  empty,  or contains the  |
               single character ``{'', or ends in `` }'').

          <STRONG>Tcl_GetVar</STRONG> and <STRONG>Tcl_GetVar2</STRONG> return the  current  value  of  a
          variable.   The arguments to these procedures are treated in
          the same way as the arguments to <STRONG>Tcl_SetVar</STRONG> and <STRONG>Tcl_SetVar2</STRONG>.
          Under normal circumstances, the return value is a pointer to
          the variable's value (which  is  stored  in  Tcl's  variable
          structure  and  will  not  change  before  the  next call to
          <STRONG>Tcl_SetVar</STRONG> or <STRONG>Tcl_SetVar2</STRONG>).  The only bits of <EM>flags</EM> that are
          used  are  TCL_GLOBAL_ONLY  and  TCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG,  both of
          which have the same meaning as for <STRONG>Tcl_SetVar</STRONG>.  If an  error
          occurs  in  reading  the variable (e.g. the variable doesn't
          exist  or  an  array  element  is  specified  for  a  scalar
          variable), then NULL is returned.

          <STRONG>Tcl_UnsetVar</STRONG> and <STRONG>Tcl_UnsetVar2</STRONG>  may  be  used  to  remove  a
          variable,  so that future calls to <STRONG>Tcl_GetVar</STRONG> or <STRONG>Tcl_GetVar2</STRONG>
          for the variable will return an  error.   The  arguments  to
          these  procedures  are  treated  in  the  same  way  as  the
          arguments to <STRONG>Tcl_GetVar</STRONG> and <STRONG>Tcl_GetVar2</STRONG>.  If the variable is  |
          successfully  removed  then  TCL_OK  is  returned.   If  the  |
          variable cannot be removed because  it  doesn't  exist  then  |
          TCL_ERROR  is  returned.   If an array element is specified,
          the given element is removed but the array remains.   If  an
          array  name  is  specified without an index, then the entire
          array is removed.
