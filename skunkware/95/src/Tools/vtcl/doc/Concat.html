     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          <STRONG>Tcl_Concat</STRONG> is a utility procedure used by several of the Tcl
          commands.   Given  a  collection of strings, it concatenates
          them together  into  a  single  string,  with  the  original
          strings   separated   by  spaces.   This  procedure  behaves
          differently than <STRONG>Tcl_Merge</STRONG>, in that the arguments are simply
          concatenated:  no  effort  is  made  to  ensure  proper list
          structure.  However, in most common usage the arguments will
          all  be  proper lists themselves;  if this is true, then the
          result will also have proper list structure.

          <STRONG>Tcl_Concat</STRONG> eliminates leading and trailing white space as it
          copies  strings  from  <STRONG>argv</STRONG> to the result.  If an element of
          <STRONG>argv</STRONG> consists of nothing but white space, then  that  string
          is  ignored entirely.  This white-space removal was added to
          make the output of the <STRONG>concat</STRONG> command cleaner-looking.

          The result string is dynamically allocated  using  <STRONG>malloc()</STRONG>;
          the  caller  must  eventually  release  the space by calling
          <STRONG>free()</STRONG>.
