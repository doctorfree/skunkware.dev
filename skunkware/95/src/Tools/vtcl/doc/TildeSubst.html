     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          This utility  procedure  does  tilde  substition.   If  <EM>name</EM>
          doesn't  start  with  a  ``~'' character, then the procedure
          returns <EM>name</EM>.   If  <EM>name</EM>  does  start  with  a  tilde,  then
          <STRONG>Tcl_TildeSubst</STRONG> returns a new string identical to <EM>name</EM> except
          that the first element of <EM>name</EM> is replaced with the location
          of  the home directory for the given user.  The substitution
          is carried out in the same way that it would be done by <EM>csh</EM>.
          If  the  tilde  is followed immediately by a slash, then the
          <STRONG>$HOME</STRONG> environment variable is  substituted.   Otherwise  the
          characters between the tilde and the next slash are taken as
          a user name, which is looked up in the password  file;   the
          user's  home  directory  is retrieved from the password file
          and substituted.

          If <STRONG>Tcl_TildeSubst</STRONG> has to do tilde substitution then it  uses  |
          the  dynamic  string at *<EM>bufferPtr</EM> to hold the new string it  |
          generates.  After <STRONG>Tcl_TildeSubst</STRONG> returns,  the  caller  must  |
          eventually invoke <STRONG>Tcl_DStringFree</STRONG> to free up any information  |
          placed in *<EM>bufferPtr</EM>.  The caller need not know  whether  or  |
          not <STRONG>Tcl_TildeSubst</STRONG> actually used the string;  <STRONG>Tcl_TildeSubst</STRONG>  |
          initializes *<EM>bufferPtr</EM> even if it doesn't  use  it,  so  the  |
          call to <STRONG>Tcl_DStringFree</STRONG> will be safe in either case.

          If an error occurs (e.g. because there was no  user  by  the
          given  name) then NULL is returned and an error message will
          be left at  <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>.   It  is  assumed  that  <EM>interp</EM>-
          &gt;<EM>result</EM>  has  been  initialized  in  the  standard  way when
          <STRONG>Tcl_TildeSubst</STRONG> is invoked.
