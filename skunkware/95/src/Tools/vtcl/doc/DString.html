     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          Dynamic  strings  provide  a  mechanism  for   building   up
          arbitrarily long strings by gradually appending information.
          If the dynamic string is short then there will be no  memory
          allocation  overhead;  as the string gets larger, additional
          space will be allocated as needed.

          <STRONG>Tcl_DStringInit</STRONG> initializes a dynamic string to zero length.
          The  Tcl_DString  structure  must have been allocated by the
          caller.  No assumptions are made about the current state  of
          the  structure; anything already in it is discarded.  If the
          structure has been used previously,  <STRONG>Tcl_DStringFree</STRONG>  should
          be  called first to free up any memory allocated for the old
          string.

          <STRONG>Tcl_DStringAppend</STRONG> adds new information to a dynamic  string,
          allocating  more memory for the string if needed.  If <EM>length</EM>
          is less than zero then everything in <EM>string</EM> is  appended  to
          the  dynamic  string;  otherwise <EM>length</EM> specifies the number
          of bytes to append.  <STRONG>Tcl_DStringAppend</STRONG> returns a pointer  to
          the  characters  of  the new string.  The string can also be
          retrieved  from  the  <EM>string</EM>  field   of   the   Tcl_DString
          structure.

          <STRONG>Tcl_DStringAppendElement</STRONG>  is  similar  to  <STRONG>Tcl_DStringAppend</STRONG>
          except  that  it  doesn't take a <EM>length</EM> argument (it appends
          all of <EM>string)</EM> and it converts the string to a  proper  list
          element  before  appending.  <STRONG>Tcl_DStringAppendElement</STRONG> adds a
          separator space before the new list element unless  the  new
          list element is the first in a list or sub-list (i.e. either
          the current string is  empty,  or  it  contains  the  single
          character  ``{'',  or the last two characters of the current
          string are  ``  {'').   <STRONG>Tcl_DStringAppendElement</STRONG>  returns  a
          pointer to the characters of the new string.

          <STRONG>Tcl_DStringStartSublist</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>Tcl_DStringEndSublist</STRONG>  can  be
          used  to create nested lists.  To append a list element that
          is itself a  sublist,  first  call  <STRONG>Tcl_DStringStartSublist</STRONG>,
          then  call <STRONG>Tcl_DStringAppendElement</STRONG> for each of the elements
          in the sublist, then call <STRONG>Tcl_DStringEndSublist</STRONG> to  end  the
          sublist.   <STRONG>Tcl_DStringStartSublist</STRONG> appends a space character
          if needed, followed by an open brace;  <STRONG>Tcl_DStringEndSublist</STRONG>
          appends a close brace.  Lists can be nested to any depth.

          <STRONG>Tcl_DStringLength</STRONG> is a macro that returns the current length
          of  a  dynamic  string  (not  including the terminating null
          character).  <STRONG>Tcl_DStringValue</STRONG> is a   macro  that  returns  a
          pointer to the current contents of a dynamic string.

          <STRONG>Tcl_DStringTrunc</STRONG> truncates  a  dynamic  string  to  a  given
          length.   It has no effect if the string was already smaller
          than  <EM>newLength</EM>.   This  procedure  does  not  free  up  the
          string's  storage  space, even if the string is truncated to
          zero length,  so  <STRONG>Tcl_DStringFree</STRONG>  will  still  need  to  be
          called.

          <STRONG>Tcl_DStringFree</STRONG> should be called when you're finished  using
          the  string.   It frees up any memory that was allocated for
          the string and reinitializes the string's value to an  empty
          string.

          <STRONG>Tcl_DStringResult</STRONG> sets the result of <EM>interp</EM> to the value  of
          the dynamic string given by <EM>dsPtr</EM>.  It does this by moving a
          pointer from <EM>dsPtr</EM> to <EM>interp</EM>-&gt;<EM>result</EM>.  This saves  the  cost
          of   allocating   new   memory   and   copying  the  string.
          <STRONG>Tcl_DStringResult</STRONG> also reinitializes the dynamic  string  to
          an empty string.
