<TITLE>Variables used by Tcl</TITLE><P>
<A HREF=/cgi-bin/getnav/VTCLRefGuide/tclintro.tclvars.html><H1>Variables used by Tcl</H1><P></A>
These global variables are created and managed
automatically by the Tcl library.  Except where noted, 
these variables should normally be treated as
read-only by application-specific code and by users.
<DL COMPACT>
<P><DT><B>env</B><DD>
This variable is maintained by Tcl as an array whose
elements are the environment variables for the process.
Reading an element will return the value of the
corresponding environment variable.  Setting an element of
the array will modify the corresponding environment
variable or create a new one if it does not already exist.
Unsetting an element of <B>env</B> will remove the
corresponding environment variable.  Changes to the
<B>env</B> array will affect the environment passed to
children by commands like <B>exec</B>.  If the entire
<B>env</B> array is unset then Tcl will stop monitoring
<B>env</B> accesses and will not update environment
variables.
<P><DT><B>errorCode</B><DD>
After an error has occurred, this variable will be set to
hold additional information about the error in a form that
is easy to process with programs.  <B>errorCode</B>
consists of a Tcl list with one or more elements.  The
first element of the list identifies a general class of
errors, and determines the format of the rest of the list.
These formats for <B>errorCode</B> are used by
the Tcl core; individual applications may define additional
formats.
<DL COMPACT>
<P><DT><B>ARITH</B> <I>code msg</I><DD>
This format is used when an arithmetic error occurs (e.g.
an attempt to divide by zero in the <B>expr</B>
command).  <I>code</I> identifies the precise error and
<I>msg</I> provides a human-readable description of the
error.  <I>code</I> will be either <B>DIVZERO</B>
(for an attempt to divide by zero), <B>DOMAIN</B> (if an
argument is outside the domain of a function, such as
<B>acos(-3)</B>), <B>IOVERFLOW</B> (for integer
overflow), <B>OVERLFLOW</B> (for a floating-point
overflow), or <B>UNKNOWN</B> (if the cause of the error
cannot be determined).
<P><DT><B>CHILDKILLED</B> <I>pid sigName msg</I><DD>
This format is used when a child process has been killed
because of a signal.  The second element of
<B>errorCode</B> will be the process's identifier (in
decimal).  The third element will be the symbolic name of
the signal that caused the process to terminate; it will be
one of the names from the include file <I>signal.h</I>,
such as <B>SIGPIPE</B>.  The fourth element will be a
short human-readable message describing the signal, such as
``write on pipe with no readers'' for <B>SIGPIPE</B>.
<P><DT><B>CHILDSTATUS</B> <I>pid code</I><DD>
This format is used when a child process has exited with a
non-zero exit status.  The second element of
<B>errorCode</B> will be the process's identifier (in
decimal) and the third element will be the exit code
returned by the process (also in decimal).
<P><DT><B>CHILDSUSP</B> <I>pid sigName msg</I><DD>
This format is used when a child process has been suspended
because of a signal.  The second element of
<B>errorCode</B> will be the process's identifier, in
decimal.  The third element will be the symbolic name of
the signal that caused the process to suspend; this will be
one of the names from the include file <I>signal.h</I>,
such as <B>SIGTTIN</B>.  The fourth element will be a
short human-readable message describing the signal, such as
``background tty read'' for <B>SIGTTIN</B>.
<P><DT><B>NONE</B><DD>
This format is used for errors where no additional
information is available for an error besides the message
returned with the error.  In these cases
<B>errorCode</B> will consist of a list containing a
single element whose contents are <B>NONE</B>.
<P><DT><B>POSIX</B> <I>errName msg</I><DD>
If the first element of <B>errorCode</B> is
<B>POSIX</B>, then the error occurred during a
POSIX kernel call.  The second element of the
list will contain the symbolic name of the error that
occurred, such as <B>ENOENT</B>; this will be one of the
values defined in the include file <I>errno.h</I>.  The
third element of the list will be a human-readable message
corresponding to <I>errName</I>, such as ``no such file
or directory'' for the <B>ENOENT</B> case.
</DL>
<P>
To set <B>errorCode</B>, applications should use library
procedures such as <B>Tcl_SetErrorCode</B> and
<B>Tcl_PosixError</B>, or they may invoke the
<B>error</B> command.  If one of these methods has not
been used, then the Tcl interpreter will reset the variable
to <B>NONE</B> after the next error.
<P><DT><B>errorInfo</B><DD>
After an error has occurred, this string will contain one
or more lines identifying the Tcl commands and procedures
that were being executed when the most recent error
occurred.  Its contents take the form of a stack trace
showing the various nested Tcl commands that had been
invoked at the time of the error.
<P><DT><B>tcl_precision</B><DD>
If this variable is set, it must contain a decimal number
giving the number of significant digits to include when
converting floating-point values to strings.  If this
variable is not set then 6 digits are included.  17 digits
is perfect for IEEE floating-point in that it
allows double-precision values to be converted to strings
and back to binary with no loss of precision.
