<HR>
<B>server_open -- 
open TCP/IP connection to server on specified port
</B>
<P>
<H2>Syntax</H2>
<B>server_open</B> [<I>option</I>] <I>host service</I>
<H2>Description</H2>
Opens a TCP/IP connection to a server of <I>host</I> on the port specified by
<I>service</I>.  The server is then accessed using the standard Tcl
file I/O commands.
<I>host</I> may be a host name or an IP address.
<I>port</I> may be a port number of a service name.
<I>option</I> is one of <B>-buf</B> or
<B>-nobuf</B>.
If no options are specified, <B>-buf</B> is the default.
<P>
If <B>-buf</B> is specified, then the file is buffered.
In this case, a pair of Tcl file ids are returned in a list.  The first id
is open for read access, the second for write.  When writing to the file,
the <B>flush</B> command must be used to force data in the buffer to
be sent to the server.  The <B>close</B> command must be called against both
file ids when through with the socket.  Buffered access will result in 
significantly better performance when reading data and will also improve
a series of writes being done without intermixed reads.  The <B>fcntl</B>
command may be used to make one of these files unbuffered.
<P>
If <B>-nobuf</B> is specified, then the file is unbuffered and a single file id,
open for both reading and writing, is returned.
<P>
If a host name is supplied and more than one address is valid for the host,
the addresses are tried iteratively until a connection is established.
Use 
<A HREF=/cgi-bin/man/man?server_info+TCLX><B>server_info</B>(TCLX)</A>
to obtain the list of valid addresses.
