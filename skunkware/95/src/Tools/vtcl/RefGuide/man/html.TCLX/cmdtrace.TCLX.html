<B>cmdtrace -- 
print trace statement for executing commands
</B>
<P>
<H2>Syntax</H2>
<B>cmdtrace</B> <I>level</I> | <B>on</B> [<B>noeval</B>] [<B>notruncate</B>] [<B>procs</B>] [<I>fileid</I>] | <B>off</B> | <B>depth</B>
<H2>Description</H2>
Prints a trace statement for all commands executed at depth
of <I>level</I> or below (1 is the top level).  If
<B>on</B> is specified, all commands at any level are
traced. 
<H2>Options</H2>
<DL COMPACT>
<P><DT><B>noeval</B><DD>
Causes arguments to be printed unevaluated.  If <B>noeval</B>
is specified, the arguments are printed before
evaluation.  Otherwise, they are printed afterwards.
<P>
If the command line is longer than 60 characters, it is
truncated to 60 and a ``...'' is postpended to
indicate that there was more output than was displayed.  If
an evaluated argument contains a space, the entire argument
is enclosed within braces ({}) to allow the reader to
visually separate the arguments from each other.
<P><DT><B>notruncate</B><DD>
Disables the truncation of commands and evaluated arguments.
<P><DT><B>procs</B><DD>
Enables the tracing of procedure calls only.  Commands that
are not procedure calls (that is, calls to commands that
are written in C, C++ or some object-compatible language)
are not traced if the <B>procs</B> option is specified.
This option is particularly useful for greatly reducing the
output of <B>cmdtrace</B> while debugging.
<P><DT><I>fileid</I><DD>
This is a file id as returned by the <B>open</B>
command.  If specified, then the trace output will be
written to the file rather than <I>stdout</I>.  A stdio
buffer flush is done after every line is written so that
the trace may be monitored externally or provide useful
information for debugging problems that cause core dumps.
<P><DT><B>off</B><DD>
Turns off all tracing.
<P><DT><B>depth</B><DD>
Returns the current maximum trace level, or zero if trace is disabled.
</DL>
<P>
The most common use of this command is to enable tracing to
a file during the development.  If a failure occurs, a
trace is then available when needed.  Command tracing will
slow down the execution of code, so it should be removed
when code is debugged.  The following command will enable
tracing to a file for the remainder of the program:
<PRE>
   cmdtrace on [open cmd.log w]
