<HR>
<B>wait -- 
wait for process created by execl to terminate
</B>
<P>
<H2>Syntax</H2>
<B>wait</B> [<B>-nohang</B>] [<B>-untraced</B>] [<B>-pgroup</B>] [<I>pid</I>]
<H2>Description</H2>
Waits for a process created with the <B>execl</B> command to terminate, either
due to an untrapped signal or a call to an <B>exit</B> system call.
If the process ID <I>pid</I> is 
specified, it waits for that process, otherwise
it waits for any child process to terminate.
<P>
If <B>-nohang</B> is specified, then waiting for a process to
terminate is not blocked.  If no process is immediately available, it returns an empty list.
If <B>-untraced</B> is specified then the status of child processes
that are stopped and whose status has not yet been reported since they
stopped, is also returned.
If <B>-pgroup</B> is specified and <I>pid</I> is not specified, then it 
waits
on any child process whose process group ID is the same as the
calling process. If <I>pid</I> is specified with <B>-pgroup</B>, then
it is taken as a process group ID,
waiting on any process in that process group to terminate.
<P>
<B>wait</B> returns a list containing three elements: 
the first element is the
process ID of the process that terminated.
If the process exited normally, the second element is ``EXIT'',
and the third contains the numeric exit code.
If the process terminated due to a signal, the second element
is ``SIG'', and the third contains the signal name.
If the process is currently stopped (on systems that support
<B>SIGSTP</B>), the second element is ``STOP'',
followed by the signal name.
<P>
<H2>Notes</H2>
It is possible to wait on processes to terminate that were created
in the background with the <B>exec</B> command.  However, if any other
<B>exec</B> command is executed after the process terminates, then the
process status will be reset by the <B>exec</B> command and will not be
available to the <B>wait</B> command.
