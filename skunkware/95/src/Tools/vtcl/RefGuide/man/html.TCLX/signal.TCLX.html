<B>signal -- 
specify action to take when Tcl is signalled by UNIX
</B>
<P>
<H2>Syntax</H2>
<B>signal</B> <I>action</I> <I>siglist</I> [<I>command</I>]
<H2>Description</H2>
Specifies the action to take when a UNIX signal is received by Extended
Tcl, or a program that embeds it.  <I>siglist</I> is a list
of either the symbolic or numeric UNIX signal (the ``SIG''
prefix is optional).
<I>action</I> is one of the following actions to be performed on receipt of the
signal. To specify all modifiable signals, use ``<scosym>&lowast;</scosym>'' (this does not 
include <B>SIGKILL</B> or <B>SIGSTOP</B> as these cannot be
modified).
<DL COMPACT>
<P><DT><B>default</B><DD>
Performs system default action when signal is received
(see <B>signal</B> system call documentation).
<P><DT><B>ignore</B><DD>
Ignores the signal.
<P><DT><B>error</B><DD>
Generates a catchable Tcl error.  It is as if the command
that was running returned an error.  The error code is in the form:
<BR>
<BR>
<B>POSIX SIG</B> <I>signame</I>
<P>
For the death of child signal, <I>signame</I> is always 
<B>SIGCHLD</B>, rather than <B>SIGCLD</B>, to allow writing portable code.
<P><DT><B>trap</B><DD>
When the signal occurs, executes <I>command</I> and continue
execution if an error is not returned by <I>command</I>.  The command will
be executed in the global context.  The command is edited before
execution, replacing occurrences of ``%S'' with the signal name.
Occurrences of ``%%'' result in a single ``%''.
This editing occurs just before the trap command is evaluated. 
If an error is returned,
then follow the standard Tcl error mechanism.
Often <I>command</I> simply <B>exit</B>s.
<P><DT><B>get</B><DD>
Retrieves the current settings of the specified signals.  A keyed
list is returned where the keys are one of the specified signals. The
values are a list consisting of the action associated with the signal: 
a 0 value if the signal may be delivered (not blocked) and a 1 if it can
be
blocked. The actions may be one of <B>default</B>, <B>ignore</B>,
<B>error</B> or <B>trap</B>.  For example, if the action is 
<B>trap</B>,
then the third element is the command associated with the action.
<P><DT><B>set</B><DD>
Sets the signals from a keyed list in the format returned by the <B>get</B> command. For this action, <I>siglist</I> is the keyed list of signal states.
Signals with an action of <B>unknown</B> are not modified.
<P><DT><B>block</B><DD>
Blocks the specified signals from being received. (POSIX systems only).
<P><DT><B>unblock</B><DD>
Allows the specified signal to be received. Pending signals
do not occur. (POSIX systems only.)
</DL>
<P>
The signal action is enabled after the specified signal has occurred.
The exception to this is <B>SIGCHLD</B> on systems without POSIX 
signals.
For these systems, <B>SIGCHLD</B> is not automatically re-enabled.  After a
<B>SIGCHLD</B> signal is received, a call to <B>wait</B> must be
performed to retrieve the exit status of the child process before issuing
another <B>signal</B> <B>SIGCHLD</B> ... command.
For code that is to be portable
between both types of systems, use this approach.
<P>
Signals are not processed until after the completion of the Tcl command that
is executing when the signal is received.  If an interactive Tcl shell is
running, then the <B>SIGINT</B> is set to <B>error</B>; 
non-interactive
Tcl sessions leave <B>SIGINT</B> unchanged from when the process started
(normally <B>default</B> for foreground processes and <B>ignore</B> for
processes in the background).
