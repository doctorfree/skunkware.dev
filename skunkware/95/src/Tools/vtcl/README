Files for extending the Visual Tcl interpreter (/bin/vtcl).

	* vtcl.h
	* libvtcl.a
	* main.c

The Visual Tcl interpreter can be extended with additional
commands that you create.  For example, you might want 
to add commands, written in C, that are specific to 
making C-based Sybase or Oracle SQL calls.

Man pages are included that document the Tcl functions for
extending the Tcl interpreter.  Please read AppInit.3 and 
CrtCommand.3 to get started.  SCO will eventually incorporate 
these man pages into its standard Visual Tcl documentation 
library.  Please note that "vtcl.h" is equivalent to the 
"tcl.h" referenced in the man pages.
