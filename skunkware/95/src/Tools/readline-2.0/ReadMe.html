<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
readline is a routine that can be called from a user
program.  It returns a line of input in a similar manner
to fgets, but while it is running, provides the user
typing to it the ability to access and edit previous
commands typed to readline.  This editing can be done
in either vi of emacs mode (emacs by default).

Use this by adding the following to your compile lines

-I/usr/skunk/include
-L/usr/skunk/lib
-lreadline
