<DD>
Pcal generates postscript calendars which can be printed
and pinned on your bulletin board.  By default, it will
generate a calendar for the current month on stdout.
Typical usage is "pcal | lp -dengr".

In addition to generating blank calendars, pcal can
also read a file of appointments and print them in the
appropriate day's square.
