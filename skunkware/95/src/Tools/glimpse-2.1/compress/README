This directory contains the source code for the new text-compression
algorithm. The source is divided as follows:

1. main_comp.c, tcomp.c: source code for tcomp (compress algorithm).
	This also uses simpletest.c and memlook.c from ../index.

2. main_uncomp.c, tuncomp.c: source code for tuncomp (uncompress algorithm).

3. read_in.c: generates build, the procedure which builds the dictionary
	to be used by tuncomp and the hash_table used by tcomp. It uses
	and interprets the output of the indexing-algorithm present
	in ../index, the software is glimpseindex (a part of glimpse).

4. hash.c: common routines used by tcomp and build.

5. string.c: common routines used by tuncomp and build.

6. misc.c, defs.h: common to all above.
