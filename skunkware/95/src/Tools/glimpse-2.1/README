GLIMPSE 2.1: a super-grep to search entire file systems

Glimpse version 2.1 improves the original version in many ways.  The
main changes are listed below.  Glimpse is a very powerful indexing and
query system that allows you to search through all your files very
quickly.  It can be used by individuals for their personal file systems
as well as by organizations for large data collections.  Glimpse is the
main search engine in Harvest (see below).

Glimpseindex, which you run by saying "glimpseindex DIR" builds an
index of all text files in the tree rooted at DIR.  
(e.g., glimpseindex ~ indexes all your files.) With it, glimpse can
search through all files much the same way as agrep (or any other
grep), except that you don't have to specify file names and the search
is fast.  For example,

	glimpse -1 unbelievable

will find all occurrences (in all your files!) of "unbelievable" 
allowing one spelling error;

	glimpse -F mail arizona 

will find all occurrences of "arizona" in all files with "mail" somewhere
in their name;

	glimpse  'Arizona desert;windsurfing' 

will find all lines that contain both "Arizona desert" and "windsurfing".

Glimpse supports three types of indexes: a tiny one (2-3% of the
size of all files), a small one (7-9%), and a medium one (20-30%).
The larger the index the faster the search.
Glimpse supports most of agrep's options (agrep is our powerful version
of grep, and it is part of glimpse) including approximate matching
(e.g., finding misspelled words), Boolean queries, and even some
limited forms of regular expressions.

Main changes and additions in version 2.1:

2.0 ---> 2.1

- Added the facility to run a glimpse server which reads the index into 
  memory and stays in the background.  Regular glimpse then submits queries
  to the server and echoes the replies.  This can improve performance if 
  the index is large since it doesn't have to be read-in for each query.
  Glimpse can contact (local or remote) servers using the -C, -J and -K
  options (see the man-pages for more details).
- Optimized the performance of glimpse for very large structured indexes:
  this is mostly relevant in Harvest.1.1.  Such indexes now take half the
  space, the indexing can be done in half the time, and structured queries
  are faster by a factor of 2 to 5!
- Made code more portable: the code now runs on the following machines
  and operating systems:
        SUNOS
        ALPHA
        SOLARIS
        HPUX
        AIX
        LINUX
- Added much improved man pages for glimpse, glimpseserver and glimpseindex.
- Many bugs were fixed based on the reports received for glimpse.2.0
  and Harvest.1.0. The code is now more robust, portable and readable.
