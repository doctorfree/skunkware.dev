This is source code that is used by various components of the Harvest system.

Notes for distribution along with glimpse:
------------------------------------------
Glimpse uses the SOIF parser distributed with Harvest to support
structured queries. To include the parser in glimpse, we made the
following changes so that glimpse could be a stand-alone system (these
changes are NOT present in the Glimpse source code present in Harvest):

1. Obtained Harvest source distribution from "harvest.cs.colorado.edu".

2. Made Harvest on our machine by running make from "harvest" directory.

3. Picked up the code in "harvest/src/common/", except for the code in
   "harvest/src/common/{gdbm,md5,url}", and put it in "glimpse/libtemplate".
   Commented out the HAVE_FLOCK and DIRENT definitions in include/autoconf.h.

4. Replaced Harvest's Makefiles for "src/common" with our own Makefiles.
   These Makefiles were INITIALLY derived by following steps 5..7
   (we DON'T have to make these changes for each new version of Harvest).

5. Changed the "Makefile"s generated by Harvest's configuration script
   to skip over the rules that made anything in "harvest/src/common" that
   needed the 3 directories mentioned above. We also changed the absolute
   pathnames of Unix commands generated by harvest to simple command names
   --- the user should add the relevant pathnames to his/her "$PATH". We
   also commented out rules to make "realclean" in ALL make files. But we
   DID NOT CHANGE "Makefile.in" in any directory, since we don't use it.

6. Added new makefiles in each of the directories "glimpse/libtemplate",
   "glimpse/libtemplate/util" and "glimpse/libtemplate/template" to handle the
   most common architectures, so that we did not need Harvest's autoconf to
   generate Makefiles.  We hope to distribute our own autoconf later.

7. Changed INSTALL macros in all makefiles to simple "cp" since no one
   else needs to use the libtemplate library distributed along with glimpse.
