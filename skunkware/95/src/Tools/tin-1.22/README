I wish to thank all the people that sent me bug fixes and comments
(especially Bryan Dongray, Clifton Royston, John Schmitz & Mark Tomlinson).
I still want to hear of any bug reports, gripes and comments but 
*PLEASE* read the INSTALL, TODO and tin.1 manual page before doing 
anything :-)!.

Also please make sure you have the newest release of tin before
reporting any  problems to me.  My time is limited  and I don't
want to have to backtrack to assist with an old problem when it 
may have already been fixed in the newest release.

I read & reply to questions that are posted to news.software.readers

Enjoy
