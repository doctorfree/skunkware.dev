Feel free to use it.  These changes to csh may only be included in a
commercial product if the inclusion or exclusion does not change the
purchase price, level of support, etc.  Please respect the individual
authors by giving credit where credit is due (in other words, don't
claim that you wrote portions that you haven't, and don't delete the
names of the authors from the source code or documentation).

<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
Tcsh is a version of the Berkeley
C-Shell, with the addition of: a command line editor, command and file
name completion, listing, etc. and a bunch of small additions to the
shell itself.
<P>
While there is a binary of this in /usr/local/contrib/bin, I would not
recommend that you use this path for your shell.  Having a shell on
an NFS server just seems a little risky to me.  So, I recommend that
you copy the contrib binary to either /bin or /usr/local/bin, on your
local disk, then change your default shell to this.
<P>
If you do this, and use scologin to log in, you will also need to copy
the file <I>Xsession-tcsh</I> from the tcsh source directory to
/usr/lib/X11/scologin, then edit the first line of this script to point
to the location in which you installed tcsh.

If you like the csh, you will not like SCO's shipping version.  You
will however like this version.

It is widely used, I have examined the source, and I have been using
it for years.

As new versions are released, I will update the source to stay in sync

Invoke it, and do csh style things.  Also try out CTRL-P and CTRL-N to
go backwards/forwards in the command history.  Emacs command line editing
is the default.
