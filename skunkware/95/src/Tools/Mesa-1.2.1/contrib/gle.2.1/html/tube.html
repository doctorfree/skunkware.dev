<title>Tubing and Extrusion Fact Sheet</title>
<body>
<h1>Tubing and Extrusion Fact Sheet</h1>

The libgle.a library contains a collection of routines for drawing
sweeps and extrusions.  A "sweep" or "extrusion" is a 2D contour
(polyline) that is swept or extruded along a 3D path (polyline).
For example, sweeping a circe along a straight line will generate a
cylinder. Sweeping a circle along a circular path will generate a
doughnut (torus).
<p>
The library also includes a set of utility routines for drawing some of
the more common extruded shapes: a polycylinder, a polycone, a
gneralized torus (circle swept along a helical path), a "helix"
(arbitrary contour swept along a helical path) and a "lathe" (arbitrary
contour swept along a helical path, with torsion used to keept the
contour aligned).
<p>
The most general extrusion supported by this library allows an arbitrary
2D contour to be swept around an arbitrary 3D path.  A set of normal
vectors can be specified to go along with the contour; the normal vectors
determine the appearence of the contour when lighting is turned on.
A set of colors and affine matrices can be specified to go along with
the 3D path.  The colors are used to color along the path. The affine
matrices are used to operate on the contour as it is swept along.  If no
affine matrices are specified, the contour is extruded using the
mathematical concept of "parrallel translation" or "gaussian
translation". If there are affine matrices, they effictively introduce a
local coordinate system that makes the local space non-euclidean.
(In the terms of general relativity, the affines are the local metric.
I'm not fooling or showing off here -- a simplified verion of the conecpts
of general relativity, as in "Einstein", really are operational here.
However, since there is no time, maybe non-euclidean geometry is a
better term. Also, apologies to math-heads, I made the affines
2x3 instead of 3x4 because the swept contours are 2D not 3D. 
This makes it easier to understand/explain for the purposes of computer
graphics.  The 3D version would have made the explanation harder, 
while bringing very little extra function/feature to any common computer
graphics usage. Maybe next time ...).


<h2>Some Types</h2>

<pre>
#define gleDouble double
typedef gleDouble gleAffine[2][3];
</pre>

<h2>Defines for Bitwise flags</h2>

<h3> Extrusion Join Styles </h3>

<dl>
<dt><b>TUBE_JN_RAW</b>
<dd>Draw polycylinders, polycones, extrusions, etc. 
    with no special treatement of the
    extrusion ends. 
<p>
<dt><b> TUBE_JN_ANGLE        </b>
<dd>Draw polycylinders, polycones, extrusions, etc. 
    by extending the different segments until they 
    butt into each other with an angular style.
<p>
<dt><b> TUBE_JN_CUT          </b>
<dd>Draw polycylinders, polycones, extrusions, etc. 
    by joining together the different segments and slicing off
    the joint at half the angle between the segments.  A cap is drawn.
    Note that the slicing plane runs through the origin of the contour
    coordinate system. Thus, the amount of slice can be varied by offsetting
    the contour with respect to the origin.
    <p>
    Note that when two segments meet at a shallow angle, the cut join
    style will potentially shave off a whole lot of the contour,
    leading to "surprising" results...

<p>
<dt><b> TUBE_JN_ROUND        </b>
<dd> Joints will be rounded. Strictly speaking, the part of the joint
   above the oigin will be rounded. The part below the origin will come
   together in an angular join.

<p>
<dt><b> TUBE_JN_MASK         </b>
<dd> Mask bits.  This can be used to mask off the bit field that defines
     the join style.
</dl>

<h3> End Caps </h3>
<dl>
<dt><b> TUBE_JN_CAP          </b>
<dd> If this is set, a cap will be drawn at each end of the extrusion.
<p>
</dl>


<h3>Automatic Normal Vector Generation </h3>
<dl>
<dt><b> TUBE_NORM_FACET      </b>
<dd> A normal vector is generated per facet. Useful for having an
     extrusion have a "faceted" look, such as when extruding a square -- each
     of the four sides of the square will look flat.
<p>
<dt><b> TUBE_NORM_EDGE       </b>
<dd> Normal vectors are generated so that they lie along edges. Useful
     for making anguler things look rounded under lighting. For example,
     when extruding a hexagon and using this flag, the hexagonal
     extrusion will look (more like a) smooth perfectly round cylinder,
     rather than a six-sided shape.
<p>
<dt><b> TUBE_NORM_PATH_EDGE  </b>
<dd> Normal vectors are generated so that they both lie on edges, and so
     that they interpolate between neighboring segments.  Useful for
     drawing "spaghetti" -- extrusions that follow a spline path.
     Because the spline path must be "tesselated" into small straight
     segments, each segment will look straight unless this flag is set.
<p>
<dt><b> TUBE_NORM_MASK       </b>
<dd> A mask useful for masking out the "norm" bits.
</dl>

<h3>Closed or Open Countours </h3>
<dl>
<dt><b> TUBE_CONTOUR_CLOSED	</b>
<dd> If this bit is set, the contour will be treated as a "closed"
contour, where the last point connects back up to the first.
It is useful to set this flag when drawing closed shapes (such as
extruded cylinders, star-shapes, I-Beams, etc.  When drawing open
extrusions (e.g. corrugated sheet metal), you DON'T want to set this
flag.

The color array may be NULL. If NULL, the current color is used.  If not
