<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
This program is a graphical front end to the ghostscript
Postscript previewer.  It displays one page at a time of
a postscript document and allow you to jump around the
document to random pages, resize the window, rotate the
image, extract random pages from the document and either
save them in a new file or print them.

It uses the athena widgets, and is compiled with the X
and C shared libraries.

<DT><B>Productivity</B>
<DD>This program can save oodles of paper.  A great way to
preview exactly what will show up on the paper before
you actually print it.

<DT><B>Safety</B>
<DD>Half the world uses it, somebody would've complained by now.

<DT><B>Verification</B>
<DD>Take any troff input document, and use the -s option to sqts,
this will cause the postscript representation of the document
to be sent to standard output instead of to the printer.
Save this in a file, then run "ghostview filename", eg.

$ sqts -mm -s doc.mm > doc.ps
$ ghostview doc.ps

<H2>How to get the source</H2>
To get a copy of the source sent to your Mosaic client in tar
format
<A HREF="http://www.scocan.sco.com/cgi-bin/contrib-get/ghostview-1.5">click here</A>.
Note that all this source is configured to be installed under
/usr/local/contrib.
To build it for a different location, compile with
<em>make HCRDESTDIR=directory</em>.
Note: this works better with the X11R4 Athena widgets than with
the X11R5 Athena widgets.
