<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
Bpatch is a curses based binary editor.  When started on a file
it displays windows containing both hex and ascii
representations of the first page of data.  You can edit it in
hex or ascii, search for patterns etc.

<DT><B>Productivity</B>
<DD>Very useful at times.  Great for looking through machine format
dumps from programs, or slightly modifiing binary programs!

<DT><B>Safety</B>
<DD>Used it for several years, and have modified the code slightly.

<DT><B>Work Planned</B>
<DD>None

<DT><B>Verification</B>
<DD>Run bpatch fileName and you should get a window on the data.
