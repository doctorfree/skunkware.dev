A collection of tools and interesting files for your SCO system
---------------------------------------------------------------

"Skunkworks" has long been used to denote underground special
projects and engineering efforts not fully controlled by
mainstream market demand.  In keeping with this tradition, SCO is
pleased to acknowledge the contributions of many technical
professionals in the computing community in bringing you this
collection of interesting software.  These programs are provided
for entertainment, education, and experimentation, possibly
even real work.

Included are:
   Early release and test versions of some SCO technologies
   Contributed code from the Internet community
   Games, interesting images, etc.

There are some useful tools here, but please use them with
caution.  SCO does not provide contract technical support for this
software, and the software is not guaranteed to work right or
be bug free.  See other disclaimers below.

This cdrom is provided as a mountable filesystem, and may be mounted
to view and use the contents.  To mount the cdrom, use the mount(C)
command with the mount point of your choice.  We suggest using a
mount point of /usr/skunk:

      # mount -r -f RCKRDG /dev/cd0 /usr/skunk

For further information on installation and use, see the
RELEASE.NOTES file.

Support and assistance for this software is not provided by SCO.
In some cases, individual authors have expressed willingness to
deal with bugs or other dialogue.  See the individual README
files.  Please note: You MUST observe the authors' conditions and
stipulations with respect to redistribution, modification, etc.
