This directory contains documentation for the system. guide.sgml is the 
SGML source for the Linuxdoc-SGML User's Guide; guide.txt is formatted
plain ASCII for the same. There's also guide.dvi and guide.ps. You should
read one of the formatted versions first---it explains how to install the
software and how to write and format documents using system.

Also, there's example.sgml, which is a simple SGML example. You should
format this example (instructions for doing so in the User's Guide) and 
print it out, along with the source, and use it as a model for writing
your own SGML docs. Also grab the SGML source for the Linux Installation 
and Distribution HOWTOs from ftp.cs.cornell.edu:/pub/mdw/HOWTO. These 
documents together will give you a good start on using the system.
