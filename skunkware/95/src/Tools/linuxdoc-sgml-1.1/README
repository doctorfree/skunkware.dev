This is Linuxdoc-SGML, a system for formatting documents, using SGML.
As the name implies it is intended for Linux documentation, although it
is applicable to various types of software documentation. Right now,
Linuxdoc-SGML will produce either LaTeX or groff (for plain ASCII) code
from a single SGML source file that you write. SGML is a generalized system
for converting to other text-formatting languages, so HTML and texinfo
support are forthcoming. Using Linuxdoc-SGML will let you produce many
different formats of documentation from a single source. It is simple enough
to be used for FAQs, HOWTOs, and other docs as well.

The file doc/guide.sgml is SGML source for the User's Guide. As you 
probably don't know how to format it yet, there is formatted plain ASCII
in doc/guide.txt. There's also guide.dvi and guide.ps, if you wish to
print them instead. The first thing you should read is doc/guide.txt, 
which explains how to install the software, and how to start writing 
documents with it. The file doc/example.sgml is a simple example document
which you can use as a tutorial. 

For real-life examples of uses of Linuxdoc-SGML, look at the Linux HOWTOs 
on ftp.cs.cornell.edu:/pub/mdw/HOWTO. These HOWTOs are written in SGML 
and automatically translated into LaTeX and nroff (and subsequently plain 
ASCII) using this system. 

Please send me any questions or bug reports, as well as suggestions for
improvement. Specifically, if you're using Linuxdoc-SGML to write Linux
documentation, and would like to see a particular feature added or changed, 
please get in touch with me. In this way Linuxdoc-SGML can be quasi-standard
for Linux documentation, and any documents written in it can be formatted
using the same software. 

Share and enjoy,
