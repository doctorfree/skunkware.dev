<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
This simple program puts your teminal into raw mode,
reads characters from standard input and displays the
resulting codes in ASCII form, as well as decimal,
octal, and hexadecimal.  Very useful for finding out
what escape sequences are sent by keys on a terminal.

<DT><B>Productivity</B>
<DD>Everyone needs a program like this once in a while, having
one saves you the 10 minutes needed to write one from scratch.

<DT><B>Safety</B>
<DD>Only 50 lines of code which were examined for traps.

<DT><B>Work Planned</B>
<DD>None.

<DT><B>Verification</B>
<DD>Just run it.
