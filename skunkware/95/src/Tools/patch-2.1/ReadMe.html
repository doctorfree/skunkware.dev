<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
Patch will take a patch file containing any of the four forms of
difference listing produced by the diff program and apply those
differences to an original file, producing a patched version.
<P>
This version of the program understands the GNU unified diff format.
The original versions of files that are modified are left with
<em>.orig</em> extensions.  If any of the patches in a diff will not
apply, those patchs are left in a file with the same basename, but
with a <em>.reg</em> extension.
