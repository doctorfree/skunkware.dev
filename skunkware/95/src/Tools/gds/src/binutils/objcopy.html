     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          The GNU <STRONG>objcopy</STRONG> utility copies the contents of an object
          file to another. <STRONG>objcopy</STRONG> uses the GNU BFD Library to read
          and write the object files.  It can write the destination
          object file in a format different from that of the source
          object file.  The exact behavior of <STRONG>objcopy</STRONG> is controlled by
          command-line options.

          <STRONG>objcopy</STRONG> creates temporary files to do its translations and
          deletes them afterward.  <STRONG>objcopy</STRONG> uses BFD to do all its
          translation work; it knows about all the formats BFD knows
          about, and thus is able to recognize most formats without
          being told explicitly.

          <STRONG>objcopy</STRONG> can be used to generate S-records by using an output
          target of <STRONG>srec</STRONG> (e.g., use <STRONG>-O</STRONG> <STRONG>srec).</STRONG>

          <STRONG>objcopy</STRONG> can be used to generate a raw binary file by using
          an output target of <STRONG>binary</STRONG> (e.g., use <STRONG>-O</STRONG> <STRONG>binary).</STRONG> When
          <STRONG>objcopy</STRONG> generates a raw binary file, it will essentially
          produce a memory dump of the contents of the input object
          file.  All symbols and relocation information will be
          discarded.  The memory dump will start at the virtual
          address of the lowest section copied into the output file.

          When generating an S-record or a raw binary file, it may be
          helpful to use <STRONG>-S</STRONG> to remove sections containing debugging
          information.  In some cases <STRONG>-R</STRONG> will be useful to remove
          sections which contain information which is not needed by
          the binary file.

          <EM>infile</EM> and <EM>outfile</EM> are the source and output files
          respectively.  If you do not specify <EM>outfile</EM>, <STRONG>objcopy</STRONG>
          creates a temporary file and destructively renames the
          result with the name of the input file.


     <STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
          <STRONG>-I</STRONG> <EM>bfdname</EM>, <STRONG>--input-target=</STRONG><EM>bfdname</EM>
               Consider the source file's object format to be <EM>bfdname</EM>,
               rather than attempting to deduce it.

          <STRONG>-O</STRONG> <EM>bfdname</EM>, <STRONG>--output-target=</STRONG><EM>bfdname</EM>
               Write the output file using the object format <EM>bfdname</EM>.

          <STRONG>-F</STRONG> <EM>bfdname</EM>, <STRONG>--target=</STRONG><EM>bfdname</EM>
               Use <EM>bfdname</EM> as the object format for both the input and
               the output file; i.e.  simply transfer data from source
               to destination with no translation.

          <STRONG>-R</STRONG> <EM>sectionname</EM>, <STRONG>--remove-section=</STRONG><EM>sectionname</EM>
               Remove the named section from the file.  This option
               may be given more than once.  Note that using this
               option inappropriately may make the output file
               unusable.

          <STRONG>-S</STRONG>, <STRONG>--strip-all</STRONG>
               Do not copy relocation and symbol information from the
               source file.

          <STRONG>-g</STRONG>, <STRONG>--strip-debug</STRONG>
               Do not copy debugging symbols from the source file.

          <STRONG>-N</STRONG> <EM>symbolname</EM>, <STRONG>--strip-symbol=</STRONG><EM>symbolname</EM>
               Do not copy symbol <EM>symbolname</EM> from the source file.
               This option may be given more than once, and may be
               combined with other strip options.

          <STRONG>-x</STRONG>,  <STRONG>--discard-all</STRONG>
               Do not copy non-global symbols from the source file.

          <STRONG>-X</STRONG>, <STRONG>--discard-locals</STRONG>
               Do not copy compiler-generated local symbols. (These
               usually start with "L" or ".").

          <STRONG>-b</STRONG> <EM>byte</EM>, <STRONG>--byte=</STRONG><EM>byte</EM>
               Keep only every <EM>byte</EM>th byte of the input file (header
               data is not affected).  <EM>byte</EM> can be in the range from 0
               to the interleave-1.  This option is useful for
               creating files to program ROMs.  It is typically used
               with an srec output target.

          <STRONG>-i</STRONG> <EM>interleave</EM>, <STRONG>--interleave=</STRONG><EM>interleave</EM>
               Only copy one out of every <EM>interleave</EM> bytes.  Which one
               to copy is selected by the <STRONG>-b</STRONG> or <STRONG>--byte</STRONG> option.  The
               default is 4.  The interleave is ignored if neither <STRONG>-b</STRONG>
               nor <STRONG>--byte</STRONG> is given.

          <STRONG>--gap-fill=</STRONG><EM>val</EM>
               Fill gaps between sections with <EM>val</EM>.  This is done by
               increasing the size of the section with the lower
               address, and filling in the extra space created with
               <EM>val</EM>.

          <STRONG>--pad-to=</STRONG><EM>address</EM>
               Pad the output file up to the virtual address <EM>address</EM>.
               This is done by increasing the size of the last
               section.  The extra space is filled in with the value
               specified by <STRONG>--gap-fill</STRONG> (default zero).

          <STRONG>--set-start=</STRONG><EM>val</EM>
               Set the start address of the new file to <EM>val</EM>.  Not all
               object file formats support setting the start address.

          <STRONG>--adjust-start=</STRONG><EM>incr</EM>
               Adjust the start address by adding <EM>incr</EM>.  Not all
               object file formats support setting the start address.

          <STRONG>--adjust-vma=</STRONG><EM>incr</EM>
               Adjust the address of all sections, as well as the
               start address, by adding <EM>incr</EM>.  Some object file
               formats do not permit section addresses to be changed
               arbitrarily.  Note that this does not relocate the
               sections; if the program expects sections to be loaded
               at a certain address, and this option is used to change
               the sections such that they are loaded at a different
               address, the program may fail.

          <STRONG>--adjust-section-vma=</STRONG><EM>section</EM>{=,+,-}<EM>val</EM>
               Set or adjust the address of the named <EM>section</EM>.  If =
               is used, the section address is set to <EM>val</EM>.  Otherwise,
               <EM>val</EM> is added to or subtracted from the section address.
               See the comments under <STRONG>--adjust-vma</STRONG>, above.  If <EM>section</EM>
               does not exist in the input file, a warning will be
               issued, unless <STRONG>--no-adjust-warnings</STRONG> is used.

          <STRONG>--adjust-warnings</STRONG>
               If <STRONG>--adjust-section-vma</STRONG> is used, and the named section
               does not exist, issue a warning.  This is the default.

          <STRONG>--no-adjust-warnings</STRONG>
               Do not issue a warning if <STRONG>--adjust-section-vma</STRONG> is used,
               even if the named section does not exist.

          <STRONG>--set-section-flags=</STRONG><EM>section</EM>=<EM>flags</EM>
               Set the flags for the named section.  The <EM>flags</EM>
               argument is a comma separated string of flag names.
               The recognized names are <EM>alloc</EM>, <EM>load</EM>, <EM>readonly</EM>, <EM>code</EM>,
               <EM>data</EM>, and <EM>rom</EM>.  Not all flags are meaningful for all
               object file formats.

          <STRONG>--add-section=</STRONG><EM>sectionname</EM>=<EM>filename</EM>
               Add a new section named <EM>sectionname</EM> while copying the
               file.  The contents of the new section are taken from
               the file <EM>filename</EM>.  The size of the section will be the
               size of the file.  This option only works on file
               formats which can support sections with arbitrary
               names.

          <STRONG>-v</STRONG>, <STRONG>--verbose</STRONG>
               Verbose output: list all object files modified.  In the
               case of archives, "<STRONG>objcopy</STRONG> <STRONG>-V</STRONG>" lists all members of the
               archive.

          <STRONG>-V</STRONG>, <STRONG>--version</STRONG>
               Show the version number of <STRONG>objcopy</STRONG> and exit.

          <STRONG>--help</STRONG>
               Show a summary of the options to <STRONG>objcopy</STRONG> and exit.
