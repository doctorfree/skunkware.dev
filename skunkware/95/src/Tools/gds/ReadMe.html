<H2>Overview</H2>
</CENTER>

Beginning with the SCO OpenServer Release 5 product, SCO ships a product
called the "Application Development Libraries and Linker" on all CD
and tape distributions.  This allows use of third party development
tools to be hosted on SCO OpenServer Release 5 systems without requiring
licensing of the SCO Development System.  <p>

<i><b>Note:</b> If you installed SCO OpenServer Release 5 from floppy you
 must order this package separately from SCO.  There is a media
charge.  <p></i>


One popular set of UNIX development tools is the GNU packages.  The
Free Software Foundation (FSF) has developed a well respected set of
compilers, linkers, assemblers, debuggers, and other tools as part of
the <a href="http://www.cygnus/com/about-gnu.html>GNU project</a>.
These packages are available under the COPYLEFT agreement.

<p>

With the help of <a href="http://www.sco.com">SCO</a>, I have taken
one popular distribution of several of the GNU packages and integrated
then into the SCO OpenServer Release 5 environment.  I chose the Cygnus
release. <P>

<a href="http://www.cygnus.com">Cygnus</a> provides commercial quality
support for many GNU tools.  Since they are the FSF chosen maintainers
of many of the packages, they have in-house experts on these tools.
Cygnus is a commercial business.  While they do advance the state of
free software, charging for support is their livlihood.

<p><H2>What is provided and why.</H2>
</CENTER>


I chose only a subset of the Cygnus tools to redistribute in binary
form.  I did not provide things like GDB, the C++ class libraries, or
the TCL kits.  I chose the minimal amount of commands to allow an SCO
user to to compile and execute most programs.  I did not perform
extensive testing on these tools, although I have used them to rebuild
themselves.  I decided (arbitrarily - a right I have as a provider of
free stuff) that providing a minimal toolset would allow people to
build and port these and other programs to SCO OpenServer 5.  I hope
others do exactly this.

<p>

I have been working with Cygnus and the FSF to get the required
changes integrated into the official versions of these packages.  

<p>

These tools are not a complete replacement for the 
<A HREF="http://www3.sco.com/Products/layered/develop/dsdvsrtc.htm">
SCO OpenServer Development System</A>.
If you are in the business of providing commercial products for
SCO systems, you really should have the SCO package.  It includes the
full documentation, the SCO debuggers (dbx, dbxtra, and the Motif
dbXtra) plus the 
<A HREF="http://www3.sco.com/Products/layered/develop/icc.htm">
SCO Optimizing C Compiler</A> that generates thoroughly impressive code.

Using these packages
</H2>
</CENTER>

<li>
	You must have SCO OpenServer Release 5.  These <i>absolutely,
	positively, will not do anything productive </i> on any
	earlier	release.  To help drive this point home, I have 
	provided only ELF binaries.  They will flatly fail to execute
	on earlier releases.


<p>
<li>
	Invoke custom<P>
	Select "Install New" option from the "Software"  menu. <P>
	Follow the prompts to steer custom toward the original
	media you used to install SCO OpenServer 5. <P>
	Select <CODE>Application Development Libraries and
	Linker</CODE>.  Install it all.  This will give you the 
	libraries, headers, and man pages. <P>
	
<li>
	The source distribution is provided as a tar archive named
<code>gds.tar.gz.</code>
	You must extract these in a writeable directory with enough space.  The
files total about 42 MB when uncompressed.  <P>
 <li>
<P>
<code>
	cd <writeable directory>
	gunzip /skunkware/src/Tools/gds/gds.tar.gz | tar xf -

<H2>Using the tools</H2>
</CENTER>
 <P>
	The GNU documentation is provided, and will apply almost
	wholescale to this project.  The following exceptions are
	noted.  All apply to the compiler, gcc. <P>
	
	<code>-B elf</code>
	instructs the compiler to emit ELF.
		The default is to emit COFF. <P>
	<code>-Ansi</code>	
uses ANSI headers and libraries <P>
	<code>-Compat30</code>	
used ODT 3.0 compatible headers and libraries. <P>
	<code>-Posix</code>
uses POSIX headers and libraries. <P>
	<code>-Xpg4</code>	
uses XPG4 headers and libraries. <P>
	<code>-Xpg4plus</code> 
uses XPG4 headers and libraries, with chosen extensions fro the ODT 3.0 environment.  This is the default. <P>

<H2>Rebuilding from source</H2> <P>
</CENTER>
	
	In any package of this flexibility, there are a number of ways
it can be configured.  Some will surely look at my method and find it
obtuse.  The major rationale of it is that it parallels the method I
use at my day job and that of Cygnus.  Since I will typically build
about eight sets of compilers from the same source tree [ two are used
in this project ] having them each in separate directories really is a
necessity. <P> 
The master source is in /skunkware/src/Tools/gds/gds.tar.gz.
<P>
I create two directories.  One is elf, one is coff.  There is some
overlap between the two sets to allow independent builds.  The ELF
release is the more capable of the two.  For example, the 'nm' command
in the ELF tree knows about COFF, but the 'nm' in the COFF tree does
not know about ELF. <P>

<H4>To make both COFF and ELF releases:</H4> <P>
<code>
		make all
</code>

<H4>To make the COFF release:</H4> <P>
<code>
		make coff
</code>


<H4>To make the ELF release:</h4> <P>

<code>
		make elf
</code>
 <P>
It is important that the make install of the ELF tree be done after
that of the COFF release.  While some things are redundant (i.e.,
'make' doesn't know anything about the object file format) the only
tools that know about both are those in the ELF tree. <P>

The binaries are provided with no debugging, but are not stripped.
This is likely to be a problem only if you are debugging the tools
themselves.  If this is the case, you know how to make your own set
with debugging and unstripped.   <P>

Also, to simplify the naming somewhat (and allow reasonable use of the '-b elf' flag), I suggest making /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/elf a symlink to /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/i486-unknown-sco3.2v5.0.0elf.

Hopefully, this will help me judge if anyone appreciates this work
enough to continue to maintain it.  

<P> If you find it *really* useful, I wouldn't
decline a care package from a local microbrewery along with a short
description of the wares produced there. :-)

<H2>Known limitations</H2> <P>
</CENTER>
	C++ is provided, but untested. <P>
	Compatibility with SCO supplied debuggers is untested.  GDB
could probably be trained to play nice with these programs if it
doesn't already.  Passing the -gstabs flag to gcc would probably
increase the chances of it working. <P>

<H2>Without Whom Department</H2>
</CENTER>

Of course, any project like this is the results of the work of many.
However, some in particular stand out.

<LI> Larry Philps <email>larryp@sco.com</email> twisted my arm into
doing this with one sentence.  (grumble, grumble.  Tell me I'm not
guru enough....)  Larry also provided much testing, some
documentation, and many quick answers about the SCO provided tools
that we have to interface with. <P>

<LI> John R. MacMillan <email>john@sco.com</email> was very patient
with my questions ranging from the undocumented to the blatantly
documented.  He unraveled the mysteries of the .notes section and many
geeky details on the linker internals. <P>

<li>

Many SCO employees that actively monitor Usenet including Bela Lubkin
and Dion Johnson for listening to the feedback about the need of
freely available libraries, headers, etc. and helping to make it
happen by passing that feedback on. <P>

<li>
Of course, the GNU project must be thanked for providing us with such
a solid code base to work from.  Support them any way you can!
