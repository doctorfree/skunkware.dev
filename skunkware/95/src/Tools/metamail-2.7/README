This directory contains source trees for metamail, a program that can
be used to work with MIME-compliant multimedia email, and a tree of
contributed source related to metamail.

For SCO, the contributed Bourne shell versions of various scripts are
used in place of the stock metamail csh versions, due to differences
between csh on SCO and whatever metamail was developed on.  The csh
scripts can be found in the src/csh-scripts directory.  The csh script
"mailserver" has no Bourne shell version, and is not installed by
default.

For more details on metamail, see src/README.
