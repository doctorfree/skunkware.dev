<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
Gnucpio is a reimplemention of UNIX cpio by the Free
Software Foundation.  It is backwards compatible with
the standard cpio.  It also supports a number of
additional archive formats, provides a crc checksum
mode, and supports filesystems with more than 64K
inodes.

<DT><B>Productivity</B>
<DD>The above extra features are not available in SCO cpio,
and are sometimes indispensable.  In particular, SCO
cpio can't deal with the SVR4 cpio format which is
used in many distribution tapes shipped by USL and
Novell.

<DT><B>Safety</B>
<DD>Used it.  Reports more warnings than SCO cpio.

<DT><B>Work Planned</B>
<DD>This version is not compiled with support for remote
tape drives; current versions of the SCO UNIX tape
drivers do not include many of the required features.
If and when SCO ships a conformant rmt program, it
would be useful to enable these features.
