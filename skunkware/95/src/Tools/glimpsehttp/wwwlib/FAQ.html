<DT>Q: I configured GlimpseHTTP correctly just like it was described
in the manual. When I run search using Glimpse by hand, it returns search results OK.
But when I use the search form (script) of GlimpseHTTP, it gives
no matches. What's wrong ?
<DD>A: There may be several reasons:
<OL>
<LI>There is a following line in /cgi-bin/aglimpse:
<PRE>
next unless $file =~ s|^$indexdir||o;
</PRE>
It filters out all lines that don't belong to a given hierarchy,
and is given for security reasons. However, it may cause some problems.
</OL>
