<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
Archive manager keeps track of various resources associated with
an archive, and facilitates indexing (both Glimpse indexing
and automatic directory overview generation).

<P>
"Archive" is our name for a file hierarchy, indexed by
the Glimpse indexing tool (glimpseindex). If the archive is to be searched
by the Mosaic server gateway, it has to be in a server
document space (accessible from DocumentRoot of your
server - see your HTTP server documentation. Symbolic links
are often used to incorparate the directory into the document
space).
<P>
Associated with an archive are the following resources:
<OL>
<LI>Disk path - location of the archive on the disk.
<LI>URL path - top archive directory location relative to DocumentRoot.
<LI>Archive title - appears as archive HTML top page title.
<LI>Search script ID - unique ID which identifies particular archive
for the search program. Normally, you shouldn't worry about this
field at all.
<LI>Archive server - URL address of your server. You may operate
several servers on the same host, and single archive manager
can be used to control archive resources on for all of the
servers. (Archives on different servers will be distinguished
by your URL address).
<LI>File per block flag. This flag when set to "yes" tells GlimpseHTTP
to build bigger index for faster search. (Speedup is about 2-5 times,
and the index is about 10-15% of the text. See Glimpse
documentation for further details). Default is "yes".
<LI>Number indexing flag. Set to "yes" if you want to index the numbers
in the text. Index can be much bigger, but you can search
for numbers quickly. Usually it's not used, and the default is "no".
</OL>
