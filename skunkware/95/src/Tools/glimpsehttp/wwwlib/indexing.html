<H1>GlimpseHTTP HTML indexer</H1>

<H2>Description</H2>
  <A HREF="index.html">GlimpseHTTP</A>
  includes automatic HTML indexer. Its primary
  goal is to generate some hypertext structure which
  supports combination of information browsing and searching.
  Searching is based on ArchiveGlimpse (aglimpse) search program, which
  is in turn a gateway between HTTP server and Glimpse
  search tool. <A HREF="http://glimpse.cs.arizona.edu:1994/">
  Glimpse</A> uses compact indices and allows 
  approximate searching, Boolean searching, and more.
<P>
  In essence, GlimpseHTTP indexer traverses
  the directory tree and builds an HTML index in each directory
  (ghindex.html by default). For example, if you have a running
  FTP site and want to make the files accessible via HTTP,
  you can use the indexer to generate HTML index for each directory.
  After that, HTTP users will be able to traverse your file
  tree by following hypertext links. In contrast with on-the-fly
  indices generated by HTTP server (for example, httpd 1.2),
  GlimpseHTTP indices will include files and directory
  descriptions if you provide it. If the description file
  .description is missing from the current directory,
  or if .description doesn't have description of some
  file/directory, default description is generated.
  Default description includes file/directory name and
  number of files in the directory (for directories), or file
  size (for regular files).
<BR>
  Generated indices can as well be used as a basis for hypertext structure
  of your server - edit them if you need fine tuning.
  Of course, you should have HTTP server running
  on your host in order to made information available via HTTP.
<P>
  Index in a given directory is obtained by combining
  the index template file (see below) with the description of the directory.

<H2>Template File</H2>
  A sample template file is included in a distribution
  as <A HREF="template.bd">wwwlib/template.bd</A>
  usually it should require no modifications.
  (Setting your e-mail address so that users
  could mail you with questions is now done automatically
  at installation time by <I>configure</I> script).

<H2>Description File</H2>
  Description file (.description by default) in every directory
  has certain information that depends on the directory.
  It has two types of lines:
  <OL>
  <LI>lines beginning with @ are normally copied in the beginning
  of generated index; they contain information pertinent to
  this directory.
  <LI>Lines beginning with filename separated from the rest of
  the line by &lt;TAB&gt; are the description of each file
  (directory). The description after the &lt;TAB&gt; will be used
  as a text in the hyperlink and, if it is a sub-directory, as a title
  for the index of that sub-directory.
  </OL>

<H2>Invocation</H2>
  <I>Index</I> is just one of the
  <A HREF="amgr.html">Archive Manager</A> options. You invoke it
  by typing <I>I &lt;archive-number&gt;</I>
