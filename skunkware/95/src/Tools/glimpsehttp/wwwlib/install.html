<H1>GlimpseHTTP installation.</H1>

This document contains directions for installing GlimpseHTTP
on your system. We assume that you have a running HTTP server
and that you understand how to install CGI scripts on it.
Also, since GlimpseHTTP is an add-on to 
<A HREF="http://glimpse.cs.arizona.edu:1994">Glimpse</A>, we assume
that you already installed Glimpse and supporting tools
somewhere in your system.
<P>
Current version was tested under httpd 1.2 from NCSA,
but it can be easily tailored to any HTTP server which supports
CGI scripts.

<H2>Distribution files</H2>

GlimpseHTTP is distributed as an add-on to Glimpse search tool.
Actually, it is a collection of gateway programs which serves
as a gateway between Glimpse and HTTP server.
<BR>

The distribution tar-file includes the following directories:
<DL>
<DT>cgi-bin
<DD>CGI scripts. You should install them in your HTTP script directory;
  see documentation on your HTTP server.
<DT>news
<DD>Tools that perform news archiving and indexing. If you don't
want the news archiving features, don't install this directory. 
If this feature is enabled, news archives will be stored in subdirectories
of this directory.
<DT>wwwlib
<DD>Auxillary tools and files, documentation.
</DL>
Normally, GlimpseHTTP files are stored in the directory
where your HTTP server stuff is located (this directory
is given by the variable HTTP_HOME in configure script).
By changing this variable, you can give an alternate location for it.

<H2>Installation.</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Copy distribution archive to a chosen directory.
<LI>Go to that directory.
<LI>Un-tar the files:
	<PRE>tar xvf glimpseHTTP.src.tar</PRE>
   You should get directories 'cgi-bin', 'wwwlib' and 'news'.
<LI>Edit the configuration script 'wwwlib/configure'
   Change the variables HTTP_HOME and HTTP_NEWSHOME to whatever
   location your server stuff is located in and where
   you want your news archive to be located (if you are not
   planning to use this feature, ignore it).
   From now on, we will refer to these paths as
   <I>HTTP_HOME</I> and <I>HTTP_NEWSHOME</I>, respectively.
   Configuration script uses Perl. Make sure
   variable PERL reflect its location (or
   they are in your search PATH).
   <BR>
   Also make variables GLIMPSE_LOC and GLIMPSEIDX_LOC point
   to where you installed Glimpse and Glimpseindex.
   If you want any default options for glimpseindex,
   change the variable GLIMPSEIDX_OPT to these options.
   Note that options that you set here cannot be overriden by Archive
   Manager. So normally, this variable should be left empty
   and all options are set in Archive Manager for each archive individually.
<LI>Run the configuration script 'wwwlib/configure'
   This will edit all the distribution files and
   set configurable variables in them, and also
   compile the C-programs for your system.
<LI>Move files from directories 'wwwlib' and 'cgi-bin'
   into directories <I>HTTP_HOME</I>/wwwlib and <I>HTTP_HOME</I>/cgi-bin
   if you performed the previous steps in a directory different
   from <I>HTTP_HOME</I>.
<LI>Move files from directory 'news' to <I>HTTP_NEWSHOME</I>
   directory, or delete 'news' directory if you don't want
   to install news archive.
<LI>Make sure you configured directory <I>HTTP_HOME</I>/cgi-bin as a script
   directory on your server. For httpd 1.2, this requires adding line
   <PRE>ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ <I>HTTP_HOME</I>/cgi-bin/</PRE>
   in your resource file (usually srm.conf)
<LI>Configure the archives using
   <A HREF="amgr.html">Archive Manager</A>,
   which is located in <I>HTTP_HOME</I>/wwwlib/amgr.
   <BR><B>NOTE:</B>
   Archive Manager generates HTML file
   (ghindex.html by default) in each of the directories of your
   archive(s), which may overwrite your existing HTML files.
   So before executing "Index" command of the archive
   manager, make sure you understand what you are doing.
<LI>Now you can use HTML forms interface to aglimpse.
   <A HREF="sample-form.html">Sample form</A>
   is located in file <I>HTTP_HOME</I>/wwwlib/sample-form.html
<LI>If you already have HTML indices describing your directories,
   you can add hyperlinks
<PRE>
http://your.host/cgi-bin/aglimpse/&lt;archive-id&gt;/&lt;archive-path&gt;?query
</PRE>
   which, when followed, will search archive <I>archive-id</I>
   in files matching <I>arhive-path</I> within given archive for
   <I>query</I> and return the list of matches.
   Using search in files whose name matches some pattern allows
   you to implement combination of browsing and searching.
   <BR>
   If you don't have HTML indices, you can use "Index" option
   of <A HREF="amgr.html">Archive Manager</A>
   to generate HTML indices and, by request,
   build Glimpse indices. To generate indices,
   indexer combines single HTML template file and per-directory
   description file to build HTML indices in each directory.
   (see <A HREF="indexing.html"><I>Indexing Notes</I></A> for details)
   Using this indexer automatically allows users of your system
   to use combination of browsing and searching.
<LI>You may wish to take a look at our
   <a href="http://glimpse.cs.arizona.edu:1994/archive">
   Demo Archive</a> to see how does <I>GlimpseHTTP</I> looks at work.

<H2>Important tips and tricks</H2>
   All the distribution files should be world readable in order
   for them to work. Scripts in cgi-bin/ and wwwlib/
   should be world executable. The reason is that most
   HTTP servers execute CGI scripts under user 'nobody'.
