<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
This program installs programs from the directory in which
they were compiled into system directories.  It is similar
to /etc/install, but conforms to the syntax of the BSD version
of /etc/install, and calls the System V version to do its work.

<DT><B>Productivity</B>
<DD>Makes it easier to compile and run programs that come from
a BSD heritage since the install lines in the Makefiles do
not need to be changed

<DT><B>Safety</B>
<DD>Examined code

<DT><B>Work Planned</B>
<DD>None

<DT><B>Verification</B>
<DD>Read the BSD man page for install(8), then try installing
something.
