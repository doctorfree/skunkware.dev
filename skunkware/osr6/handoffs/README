This download area, ftp://ftp2.sco.com/pub/skunkware/osr6/handoffs/
contains packaging and dist trees used to create the custom installable 
media images. These files are likely only useful to developers, vendors,
ISV's, or resellers who wish to modify and create new packages. Most folks
will just want to download the already packaged media images in
ftp://ftp2.sco.com/pub/skunkware/osr6/vols/
