This download area, ftp://ftp2.sco.com/pub/skunkware/osr6/vols/
contains open source packages ported and packaged for SCO OpenServer 6.
These packages are not officially supported and many are still in
an alpha or beta release phase. If you find problems with a package
or would like to make a suggestion/comment, email skunkware@sco.com.

These files are cpio archives of media images suitable for installation
with the SCO Software Manager (/etc/custom).

Media images for a product may be installed as follows:

After downloading the component-version-VOLS.cpio file, login to your system
as the root user, extract the VOLS.cpio archive into an empty directory
(say, for example, the directory /tmp/foobar) and run the "custom" command.
Select the menu items "Software" -> "Install New". Select your host and,
when prompted for the Media Device, select "Media Images" and "Continue".
When prompted for the Image Directory, type in "/tmp/foobar or whatever
is the name of the directory containing the extracted VOLS.cpio media images.
Select Ok and proceed.
