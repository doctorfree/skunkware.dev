OpenOffice 2.0
==============

OpenOffice is a free office suite compatible with all other major office
suites. The download is a tar archive of media images suitable for
installation with the SCO Software Manager (/etc/custom) and is
approximately 175 MB in size.

Requirements: OpenServer 6 with Maintenance Pack 3

Dependencies: KDE 3.5.6 and extshells from Maintenance Pack 3

Installation:
          Download and extract the tar archive of media images for
          OpenOffice (oo-2.0.3Si-VOLS.tar) into an empty directory.
          For example:

          # mkdir /u/tmp/oo
          # cd /u/tmp/oo

          Establish an anonymous FTP connection to ftp2.sco.com and
          download /pub/skunkware/osr6/vols/oo-2.0.3Si-VOLS.tar
          Alternatively, use a command-line tool like lynx or wget to download:
          # lynx -dump \
              ftp://ftp2.sco.com/pub/skunkware/osr6/vols/oo-2.0.3Si-VOLS.tar \
              > oo-2.0.3Si-VOLS.tar
          or
          # wget ftp://ftp2.sco.com/pub/skunkware/osr6/vols/oo-2.0.3Si-VOLS.tar 

          # tar xvf oo-2.0.3Si-VOLS.tar

          Using the SCO Software Manager (/etc/custom), select
          Software -> Install New -> From <your system>
          Select "Media Images" for the Media Device and "Continue"
          Enter the directory where the OpenOffice media images were
          extracted (in above example, /u/tmp/oo) for the Image
          Directory and press "OK". 

Execution:
          The installation of OpenOffice on OpenServer 6 will create
          menu entries in the KDE desktop "K Menu" under "Office".
          Alternatively, OpenOffice can be run from a UNIX shell via
          one of the convenience scripts placed in the /usr/bin directory.
          For example, the OpenOffice frontend can be run with the command
                         # /usr/bin/ooffice

Setup:    Java         
          ====
          OpenOffice 2.0.3 is currently restricted to use Java 1.4.2.
          Java 1.4.2.13 or later must be installed (1.4.2.16 will be 
          installed with Maintenance Pack 3). In order for OpenOffice
          to see the Java 1.4.2 automatically, /usr/java should be
          symbolically linked to point to /opt/java2-1.4.2

          If you have chosen to have /usr/java linked to /opt/java2-1.5.0,
          each user of OpenOffice will need to configure Java as follows:

               Tools => Options => Java => Add

          and set the path to /opt/java2-1.4.2

          Later releases of OpenOffice will be configured to work with J2SE 5.0

          Printing
          ========
          OpenOffice, when run under KDE, will query KDE's concept of
          configured printers. KDE works best with CUPS. That is,
          it is currently unable to detect UNIX printers configured
          with SCO Admin. To configure printing for OpenOffice, first
          configure CUPS then run:
              "KDE Kontrol Center" -> "Peripherals" -> "printers"

Notes:    The Letter, Fax and Agenda Wizards will cause 
          OpenOffice to abort. Attempting to initiate any of these 
          wizards will result in the abrupt termination of OpenOffice. 
          This is a known OpenOffice issue, # 35454 "crash by finishing 
          any wizard", fixed in a later Open Office release.
