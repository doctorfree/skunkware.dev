===========================================
Media images suitable for installation with the SCO Software Manager
(/etc/custom) are available in the "vols" subdirectory.

Media images for a product may be installed as follows:

After downloading the component-version-VOLS.cpio file, login to your system
as the root user, extract the VOLS.cpio archive into an empty directory
(say, for example, the directory /tmp/foobar) and run the "custom" command.
Select the menu items "Software" -> "Install New". Select your host and,
when prompted for the Media Device, select "Media Images" and "Continue".
When prompted for the Image Directory, type in "/tmp/foobar or whatever
is the name of the directory containing the extracted VOLS.cpio media images.
Select Ok and proceed.

ftp://ftp2.sco.com/pub/skunkware/osr6/src/
===========================================
Source code archives and patches used to compile these packages are
available in the "src" subdirectory.

ftp://ftp2.sco.com/pub/skunkware/osr6/handoffs/
===============================================
Packaging and dist trees used to create the custom installable media

ISV's, or resellers who wish to modify and create new packages. Most folks
will just want to download the already packaged media images in
