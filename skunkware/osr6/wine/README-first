This is a Developer release of Wine.
I have tested this release on OpenServer 6.

IMPORTANT:
After installing, in order to run Wine you must first
add /usr/local/bin to your PATH and /usr/local/lib/wine to your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. For example, in the Bourne, Korn, or Bash shells:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib/wine
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
export PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH
