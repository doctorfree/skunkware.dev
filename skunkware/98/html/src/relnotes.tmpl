<DD>
Many of the components of SCO Skunkware may be viewed as productivity and
development tools to be taken seriously. Don't let its whimsical nature
fool you. Examples of serious tools on Skunkware 98 include:
<UL>
<LI>The GNU C Compilation system
<LI>Mtools - DOS filesystem manipulation tools
<LI>Scripting languages (Tcl, Tk, Python, Expect)
<LI>Internet/Network tools (apache, squid, xdir, ldap, many more)
<LI>Editors and text processing tools (xcoral, xemacs, ghostscript, vim, xhtml)
<LI>Many many more
</UL>
<DT><A NAME="fun"></A>
<DD>
Of course, Skunkware also contains fun stuff. Gotta have something to keep
the polecats entertained thru the night. Examples include:
<UL>
<LI>Games (xdoom, xgalaga, xboing, xpool)
<LI>Graphics (mathematical recreations, animation viewers, image manipulators)
<LI>Audio (audio players and editors, mixers, CD players, games with sound)
<LI>Stuff (view astrology charts, graphical fish tank, lots more)
</UL>
<DT><A NAME="experimental"></A>
<DD>
Several of the components on this CD should be considered experimental.
Consider Skunkware a research tool. Examples:
<UL>
<LI>Egcs, the Experimental GNU Compilation System from Cygnus.
<LI>Alpha or pre-release versions of window managers and graphical tools
<LI>A variety of Java classes and applications from Acme Laboratories
<LI>VRwave, a Java based VRML 2.0 browser
<LI>Endo, a tool for exploring dynamical systems in the plane
</UL>

<LI><A NAME="mounting">Mounting the Skunkware 98 CD-ROM</A>
<P>
[Note that it is not necessary to mount the Skunkware 98 CD-ROM
in order to install the custom installable packages. See the section
below on <A HREF="#installing">installing the Skunkware 98 software</A>.]
<P>
To mount the Skunkware 98 CD-ROM on an SCO UnixWare system, use the command:
<PRE>
    # mount -r -f cdfs /dev/cdrom/c1b0t0l0 /<I>mount-point</I>
</PRE>
where <I>mount-point</I> refers to the full pathname of the directory on
which you wish to mount the CD-ROM (e.g. /mnt).
Note also that the CD-ROM device name may vary from system to system
(the exact name for the cdrom device is usually the only entry in /dev/cdrom).
<P>
On an SCO OpenServer Release 5 system issue the command:
<PRE>
    # mount -r /dev/cd0 /<I>mount-point</I>
</PRE>
<P>
<LI><A NAME="moving">Making room for the Skunkware 98 software</A>
<P>
The installation of all the Skunkware 98 components requires about 500 MB 
of free space on the root partition (/opt/K/SKUNK98). If your root partition
does not have sufficient space, or you wish to utilize an alternate filesystem
for the Skunkware 98 components, prior to installing Skunkware 98 create
a symbolic link in /opt/K as follows:
<PRE>
        # mkdir /u/skunk98
        # cd /opt/K
        # ln -s /u/skunk98 SKUNK98
</PRE>
The above commands assume a separate /u filesystem with sufficient disk space.
The exact name of the alternate filesystem mount point is system dependent.
<P>
You may also wish to place your /usr/local file hierarchy on a separate
filesystem. To do so, create the appropriate symbolic link - e.g.
<PRE>
    # ln -s /u/local /usr/local
</PRE>
<P>
<LI><A NAME="inst">Installing the Skunkware 98 Software</A>
<P>
The installation of all the Skunkware 98 components requires about 500 MB 
of free space on the root partition for OpenServer (/opt/K/SKUNK98). 
<P>
<A NAME="part">
After mounting the Skunkware 98 CD (mount -r /dev/cd0 /mnt), as root run
the command:</A>
<PRE>
    # /<I>mount-point</I>/INSTALL
</PRE>
The Skunkware INSTALL script
will allow you to select from a menu of Skunkware "software sets" including
All Components, Development Tools, Shells, Audio/Video Components, etc.
The INSTALL script acts as a front-end for a non-interactive installation
using the Software Manager (/etc/custom).
<P>
Alternatively, an interactive graphical installation can be performed by 
running the Software Manager (/etc/custom) as root. 
Select "Software" -> "Install New".
If your Skunkware CD is inserted in the local CD-ROM drive, install from the
local host and select the appropriate CD-ROM drive as the Media Device.
<P>
After the Software Manager has read the Skunkware product database, you can
select which components you wish to install or choose to install the full
product (see <A HREF="#moving">notes above on disk space considerations</A>).
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> <I>A full installation of SCO Skunkware 98 will consume over
500 Megabytes of disk space and take a couple of hours</I>.
<P>
<A NAME="indi">
To install an individual package, execute the command:</A>
<PRE>
    # custom -p SKUNK98:default:Package -i -m /dev/rcd0
</PRE>
where "Package" is the name of the desired component. See the file
<A HREF="osr5/COMPONENTS.html">
/<I>mount-point</I>/osr5/COMPONENTS</A> for the list of available components.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="audi">Installing the Open Sound System audio drivers</A>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> You should remove any audio drivers you currently have
   installed.  The important thing is that you remove
   them from the kernel.  If you have an older copy of the
   OSS drivers installed, you may be able to remove them
   from the kernel by running "/usr/lib/oss/Remove".  On
   a different note, the SCO PnP driver should be enabled.
   If you had an older version of the OSS drivers, the SCO
   PnP driver might have been disabled.  The file
   "/etc/conf/sdevice.d/PnP" should contain a line like
   so (with "Y" in the second field):
<PRE>
	PnP	Y	1	0	etc. etc....
</PRE>
   while /etc/conf/sdevice.d/pnp should have "N" in the
   second field, if that file exists.  If not, make the
   appropriate changes, rebuild the kernel with:
<PRE>
	/etc/conf/bin/idbuild
</PRE>
   and reboot.

<LI> Run "scoadmin isa" or "/etc/pnp" (should be the same thing)
   to do plug-and-play configuration if your card is plug-and-play.
   If you don't know whether your card is plug-and-play, you
   can find out by running this command.  If you see your card
   listed, it's plug-and-play.  If not, it's not.  If it is
   plug-and-play, make sure it is configured and make note of
   the resources it is configured to use.  At this point, the
   resources must be re-entered manually in the audioconfig
   utility.

<LI> Run "/usr/lib/audio/audioconfig/audioconfig".  Choose the
   "add card" button.  Choose your card or, for plug-and-play,
   choose "autodetect".  Enter the appropriate resources
   for your card, and press okay.

<LI> If you have problems, email <A HREF="mailto:skunkware@sco.com">
     skunkware@sco.com</A>.  Otherwise, reboot and
   test the soundcard.  One way to do that is to re-run the
   audioconfig program and use the "test" button.  Alternatively,
   find a .au file and "cat myaufile.au > /dev/audio".
</OL>
<P>
NOTES:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> This is an early availability release of the OSS audio drivers.
     For subsequent releases, check
     <A HREF="http://www.sco.com/download/">http://www.sco.com/download/</A>.
<LI> You must do the plug and play configuration as a separate step
   before running audioconfig, as described above (if you have
   a PnP card, that is).

<LI> Once the soundcard is configured, it is not active until you
   reboot.  So, for example, don't bother clicking the "test"
   button until you reboot.  :)

<LI> The audioconfig utility will display some stuff in the xterm
   while it is running.  This is for debugging purposes and will
   help me figure out what is wrong if you run into trouble.
</OL>
<P>
<LI><A NAME="conf">Configuring your system for use with Skunkware 98</A>
<P>
If, as root, you are running the X.Desktop, then you can configure your
system to mount the SCO Skunkware 98 CD-ROM by double-clicking the System
Administration folder -&gt; Filesystems -&gt; Filesystem Manager. Alternatively,
at a root shell prompt, type "scoadmin f" to bring up the Filesystem Manager.
Next select Mount -&gt; Add Mount Configuration -&gt; Local and enter /dev/cd0 for 
the device and a mount point. Change the "Can Users Mount" 
to Yes and uncheck the "At System Startup" mount. After completing this 
operation, you should be able to mount and unmount the SCO Skunkware 98 CD-ROM 
by typing "mnt <I>mount-point</I> and "umnt <I>mount-point</I> as any user.
<P>
<P>
After completing the installation of the Skunkware 98 components you desire,
you may wish to add /usr/local/bin to your PATH and /usr/local/man to your
MANPATH. You may also wish to add /usr/local/java to your CLASSPATH. It should
not be necessary to add /usr/local/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH as the
Skunkware 98 shared libraries have been built with the appropriate flags.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="browsing">Browsing the Skunkware 98 HTML Documents</A>
<P>
For an introductory tour, point a web browser at 
<A HREF="index.html">
/<I>mount-point</I>/index.html</A>
<PRE>
    # /usr/bin/X11/netscape file:/<I>mount-point</I>/index.html
</PRE>
If you do not have Netscape Navigator installed, download a trial copy from
<A HREF="http://www2.sco.com">http://www2.sco.com</A> 
or (for OpenServer) install NCSA Mosaic off of this CD:
<PRE>
    # custom -p SKUNK98:default:Mosaic -i -m /dev/rcd0
</PRE>
or use any browser that supports tables and open the URL file:/<I>mount-point</I>/index.html
(assuming you mounted the CD on /<I>mount-point</I>).
<P>
If you do not have or want a graphical browser, you can install Lynx 2.7.1
(a character browser) off of this CD (OpenServer only, if you are running
UnixWare 7 then Lynx is included by default).
<PRE>
    # custom -p SKUNK98:default:Lynx -i -m /dev/rcd0
</PRE>
Then execute the command:
<PRE>
    # lynx file:/<I>mount-point</I>/index.html
</PRE>
<P>
SCO Skunkware 98 contains files suitable for installation on
SCO OpenServer systems with the Software Manager facility (/etc/custom). 
In addition, there are compressed archives of pre-compiled utilities
which can be extraced manually. Finally, there are 
<A HREF="src/">hundreds of source archives</A>
(almost everything on the CD is accompanied by the source used to build it).
<P>
<LI><A NAME="removing">Removing the Skunkware 98 software</A>
<P>
On SCO OpenServer systems, use the Software Manager (/etc/custom) to remove
Skunkware 98 components. This can be done interactively by running custom and
selecting the component(s) you wish to remove, or non-interactively by
issuing a command like the following:
<PRE>
    # custom -p SKUNK98:default -r &lt;package-list&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="other"><B>Accessing the CD on other platforms</B></A>
<P>
On any other system, after mounting or otherwise making the High-Sierra
Rockridge CD-ROM filesystem accessible, point your WWW browser to
<I>mount-point</I>/index.html where <I>mount-point</I> indicates
the UNIX directory or Windows drive representing the CD-ROM.
<P>
<A NAME="source"><B>Source Code Distribution</B></A>
<P>
In almost all cases, source code is also provided, so you can rebuild 
for earlier SCO releases or other platforms. A full source archive for
this and previous Skunkware releases is available at either
<A HREF="http://www.sco.com/skunkware/src/">
http://www.sco.com/skunkware/src/</A>
or
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/src/">
ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/src/</A>.
<P>
Source code is provided in the <A HREF="src/CONTENTS.html">src directory</A>.  
In some cases, source code is provided but no
compiled binaries. The source distributions are in gzip-compressed
tar or cpio format. In order to extract these, use the command:

<PRE>
    $ gzcat /<I>mount-point</I>/src/&lt;directory&gt;/&lt;package&gt;.tar.gz | tar xf -
</PRE>

or, in the case of a compressed cpio archive:

<PRE>
    $ gzcat /<I>mount-point</I>/src/&lt;directory&gt;/&lt;package&gt;.cpio.gz | cpio -icdu
</PRE>

Where &lt;directory&gt; refers to the top-level source directory
and &lt;package&gt; is the package name (e.g. gzip-1.2.4).
<P>
If you do not have gzcat installed (part of the gzip package), you can
install it off of the SCO Skunkware 98 CD via the command:

<PRE>
        (OpenServer systems)
        # custom -p SKUNK98:default:GZIP -i -m /dev/rcd0

        (UnixWare 7 systems)
        # pkgadd -d /<I>mount-point</I>/uw7/gzip.pkg

        (UnixWare 2.x systems)

<A NAME="config"><B>Default Package Configurations</B></A>
<P>
Many of the Skunkware packages contain configuration files. In order to
avoid excessive user interaction during installation and to provide a
consistent and well integrated set of configurations, the Skunkware 98
packages have been pre-configured (with the exception of xmcd which will
prompt you for your CD-ROM make and model; and inn which may prompt for a
"news" user password).
<P>
Generally, you will not need to alter the default configurations but you
may choose to do so. Some of the package pre-configurations are as follows:
<UL>
<LI><A NAME="apache">
The Apache web server is configured to run on port 8080</A>. If you are not
going to use Squid as an httpd accelerator, you may wish to run the Apache
web server on port 80. To do so, modify /usr/local/lib/apache/etc/httpd.conf.
Further, the default document directory for the Apache web server is set to
/usr/local/lib/apache/share/htdocs. If you wish to serve your HTML documents out
of a different location, modify /usr/local/lib/apache/etc/srm.conf and
/usr/local/lib/apache/etc/access.conf
<LI><A NAME="squid">
The Squid Internet Object Cache is configured to run on port 80</A> and to 
act as an httpd accelerator for the server running on port 8080 (by default,
the Apache web server). If you wish to use this default configuration,
remember to stop/disable any other server running on port 80. In particular,
the Netscape FastTrack server is usually configured to run on port 80.
<LI><A NAME="gcc">
Skunkware 98 contains a custom installable integrated GNU compilation system.
This includes both the Free Software Foundation's GNU C Compiler and Cygnus' 
experimental GNU C Compiler (EGCS).
The file /etc/default/gcc can be used to specify which is the default
preferred compiler. The entries in this file set the system-wide default.
An individual user can override this default by setting and exporting the
PREFERRED_GCC environment variable. This variable must be set to either
/usr/local/lib/front-fsf or /usr/local/lib/front-egcs. If set incorrectly,
the system will revert to the preference specified in /etc/default/gcc.
<LI><A NAME="htmlman">
Several packages install documentation, manuals, tutorials and other</A>
introductory and informative matter as HTML documents in /usr/local/man/html.
During the installation of these packages, a symbolic link is created in
the default Apache web server document root. Thus, the documentation for
these packages can be accessed via a browser. For instance, the HTML documents
describing the Xcoral editor are installed in /usr/local/man/html/xcoral.
A symbolic link pointing to this location is installed as
/usr/local/lib/apache/htdocs/docs/xcoral. Thus, to access the Xcoral HTML 
documentation, you need only open the URL http://your.server.name/docs/xcoral/
These convenience links are provided for Count, SmallEiffel, addressbook,
crossfire, gd, giftrans, gimp, git, gv, GNU history, Hypermail, jasmin,
klassmaster, lxrun, mathrec, msql, mutt, mysql, nedit, omniORB, php,
GNU readline, sox, squid, tcsh, vrwave, wget, wwwtar, xacc, xcoral, xtar, 
xtide and xv.
<LI><A NAME="sw98mount">
If you mount the CD-ROM under your default document root, </A>
you will be able to serve up the Skunkware 98 HTML documents
with your web server. For instance, after installing the apache and squid
packages, if you mounted the Skunkware 98 CD-ROM on 
/usr/local/lib/apache/share/htdocs/skunkware, then opening the URL
http://your.server.name/skunkware/ would allow you to browse the contents
of the Skunkware 98 CD-ROM from any browser that could access your server.
<LI><A NAME="inn">
The INN installation is configured to install many of its files owned </A>
by the user "news" and group "news". During the inn package installation,
this user/group is created if it doesn't already exist. If the installation
creates a "news" user, you will be prompted for a password during installation.
<LI><A NAME="xmcd">
The Xmcd (Motif audio CD player) package will prompt you for the CD drive </A>
configuration during the installation. If you wish to configure Xmcd during
the installation, you should know the make and model number of your CD drive(s).
<LI><A NAME="netpbm">
The Netpbm suite of graphical file conversion utilities</A>
are in the Glib package. In order to install these utilities, issue the command:
<PRE>
    # custom -p SKUNK98:default:Glib -i -m /dev/rcd0
</PRE>
They are installed in /usr/local/bin. The Glib package is installed either
during a full installation of Skunkware 98 or as part of the "Development
Tools" software set.
<LI><A NAME="perlmod">Additional Perl modules</A> will be available via 
<A HREF="http://www.sco.com/skunkware/osr5/interp/perl/">
http://www.sco.com/skunkware/osr5/interp/perl/</A>. These include various
database interfaces, ImageMagick enhancements and more.
<LI><A NAME="perl505">Perl 5.005 installation</A> -
Skunkware 98 contains a custom installable Perl 5.004_04 distribution as
well as a gzip'd tar archive of a Perl 5.005 binary distribution. In order
to install Perl 5.005, insert the Skunkware 98 CD in the CD-ROM drive and
execute the following (as root):
<PRE>
    # custom -p SKUNK98:default:Perl -r
    # mount -r /dev/rcd0 /mnt
    # cd /
    # gzcat /mnt/osr5/interp/perl-5.005/perl-5.005.tar.gz | tar xf -
    # umount /mnt
</PRE>
You may also wish to create a link from /usr/local/bin/perl to /usr/bin/perl.
Note that gzcat is in /usr/local/bin.
<LI><A NAME="wmconf">Alternate window managers' default configurations</A>
are those provided in the source distributions and will need to be tailored
for use on OpenServer 5. That is, the rc startup files for fvwm, fvwm95,
AfterStep and WindowMaker may need system-specific
configuration. The Skunkware team plans on making OpenServer specific
window manager configuration files available via the Skunkware web site at
<A HREF="http://www.sco.com/skunkware/x11/winman/">
http://www.sco.com/skunkware/x11/winman/</A>.
<LI><A NAME="wmaker">Individual account configuration of WindowMaker</A>
must be done prior to using the WindowMaker window manager. To do so,
login as the user who desires to use WindowMaker and run the WindowMaker
configuration script:
<PRE>
    $ /usr/local/bin/wmaker.inst
</PRE>
When prompted for the name of the initialization file to use, enter
<I>.startxrc</I>
<LI><A NAME="xbuffy">XBuffy default mailboxes</A> are set in the file
<I>/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XBuffy</I>. In order to get xbuffy to monitor
your personal mailboxes, you will need to add a line similar to the following
to your $HOME/.Xdefaults :
<PRE>
*mailboxes:     /usr/spool/mail/wfp:/home/wfp/.mailbox:/home/wfp/nsmail/Inbox
</PRE>
replacing the user name wfp with your own.

<LI> <A NAME="disk5">A full installation of the SCO Skunkware 98 </A>
  media images for SCO OpenServer
  requires approximately 500 Mb of disk space. If your system's root filesystem
  does not contain sufficient disk space (a check is performed at the
  beginning of the installation), then you may wish to perform the following
  workaround (rather than removing files from the root partition):
<PRE>
      # cd /opt/K
      # ln -s /u/local local
</PRE>
  Where /u/local resides on an additional disk with sufficient space.

<P>
</LI><LI><A NAME="xgrab">Some programs - including the
xfishtank animated background and the xgrabsc command - may need a 
PseudoColor visual</A>.
Before attempting to run either xfishtank or xgrab, 
the front-end for xgrabsc, 
you may need to configure your X server to run in 256 color mode. Sorry.

<P>
</LI><LI><A NAME="vartmp">On OpenServer 5.0.4 and earlier</A>
there may be no /var/tmp directory. Some Skunkware components (e.g. nvi)
may attempt to use this directory for temporary files. A /var/tmp directory
can be created as follows:
<PRE>
    # ln -s /usr/tmp /var/tmp
</PRE>
</LI><LI><A NAME="winman">Alternate window managers</A> - The Skunkware 98
window managers (Fvwm 2, AfterStep, WindowMaker, Kde) should be considered
experimental. Of the four, Fvwm 2 is the most stable and well tested.
Some color-intensive X clients may not be able to allocate sufficient
color cells, particularly with WindowMaker. Additional window managers
and updated versions of these will be available at the 
<A HREF="http://www.sco.com/skunkware/x11/winman/">Skunkware web site</A>.

<P>
</LI><LI><A NAME="kde">The K Desktop Environment (KDE)</A>, release 1.0,
was added to Skunkware 98 at the last minute. KDE installs in the
/usr/local/kde directory. Very little testing of kde was possible.
Documentation for KDE can be found at 
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org/documentation/index.html">the KDE web site</A>
and in the Skunkware 98 installation of KDE at http://localhost/docs/kde
(assuming you have installed KDE, Apache and Squid).
<P>
Source for KDE can be retrieved either from the KDE ftp site at

It is hoped that this remarkable new desktop environment will please the
graphical Skunkware 98 user.

The gimp command has been wrappered with a shell script which does this for you.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="man5">
  The SCO OpenServer 5 man command</A> expects the man pages to be in
  directories named man.suffix and cat.suffix. Many public domain
  packages place their manual pages in directories like man1, man8,
  cat1, cat8 and so on. Further, these directories are usually located
  in /usr/local/man rather than /usr/man. To remedy this, add /usr/local/man
  to your MANPATH (see /etc/default/man) and create symbolic links from
  mann to man.n, catn to cat.n and so on.

<P>
</LI><LI><A NAME="audio">Xdoom needs -nosound argument if no audio</A>.
If the OSS audio driver is not installed, in order to run the Xdoom
video game you will need to invoke it with the "-nosound" argument. For
instance:

<LI><A NAME="osr5g++">
  On OpenServer, if you use g++ to link an ELF binary, libg++ and libstdc++</A>
  will be linked in automatically, regardless of whether they are
  actually used by your program.  Such binaries will not run on
  machines that do not have the libg++ and libstdc++ shared
  libraries installed.  If you know your program does not need
  these libraries, you can link it using gcc and they will not be
  included.  In programs that do use libg++ or libstdc++, you can
  maintain portability by using the "-static" flag which makes a
  statically-linked binary.

<P>
</LI><LI><A NAME="endo">Endo default window sizes</A> may appear too small.
Although the pre-configured scripts in /usr/local/mathrec/endo do create
correct window sizes, invoking the endo program with no arguments may
create windows with a minimum height. If this is the case, simply enlarge
the window(s) by clicking on and dragging the window border(s).

<P>
</LI><LI><A NAME="xlincity">
  Apparently xlincity needs a pseudo-color visual</A>. That is, if you have
  configured your video for use with more than 256 colors, xlincity fails
  with "Major opcode of failed request:  89 (X_StoreColors)". If you find
  you can run xlincity in TrueColor mode, let us know.
