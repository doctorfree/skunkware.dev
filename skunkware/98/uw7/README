Skunkware 98 contains only those UnixWare 7 Skunkware packages
which are either updates or new since the release of Skunkware 7.

UnixWare 7 ships with the Skunkware 7 CD-ROM which was specifically
architected for installation on UnixWare 7 systems. If you have received
a UnixWare 7 system but for some reason did not get a Skunkware 7 CD-ROM,
please e-mail skunkware@sco.com or download the desired software components
from either :
    http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/uw7/ 
or 
    ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/uw7/
