This is a special SCO Skunkware release of the Open Sound System
(OSS) drivers for _Soundblaster_compatible_soundcards_only_ for
SCO OpenServer (5.0.x), SCO UnixWare (2.1.1 and 2.1.2), and
SCO UnixWare 7.  These drivers have been licensed to SCO from 
4Front Technologies.

    These drivers should replace the old Voxware drivers (from
tls566).  The OSS drivers include many new features, including a
curses-based configuration utility, autodetection of many types
of cards, and support for newer Plug & Play audio cards.

    If you do not have a Soundblaster-compatible audio card,
these drivers will not work for you.  You can purchase drivers
for other audio cards at the 4Front Technologies web site:

                  http://www.4front-tech.com/

    To install the OSS drivers, unpack the appropriate archive
(oss.osr5.tar.gz for OpenServer 5.0.x, oss.uw.tar.gz for Unixware 2.1.x,
oss.uw7.tar.gz for UnixWare 7) into /usr/lib.  This will create the directory
/usr/lib/oss.  Read /usr/lib/oss/Readme for further instructions.

NOTE:  Unlike the old Voxware drivers, you must run the
/usr/lib/oss/soundon utility after each reboot to activate the
audio driver.

NOTE:  These drivers do not support the Emu8000 synth chip found
in some of the higher-end Soundblaster cards.  If your audio
card has the Emu chip, you can still use these drivers to play
samples, however, MIDI synthesis will not work.  A special
package that supports the Emu8000 chip can be purchased at the
4Front Technologies web site.
