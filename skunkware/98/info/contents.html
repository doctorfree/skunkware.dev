Description:
HERMES is a library designed to convert a source buffer with a specified

On top of that, HERMES provides fast surface clearing, stretching and some
dithering. Supported platforms are basically all that have an ANSI C
compiler as there is no platform specific code but those are supported: DOS,
Win32 (Visual C), Linux, FreeBSD (IRIX, Solaris are on hold at the moment)

AfterStep's Wharf or on a workspace dock, a 'clip' which extends the
application dock's usefulness.

You should install the WindowMaker package if you use Window Maker as
your window manager or if you'd like to try using it. If you do
install the WindowMaker package, you may also want to install the
AfterStep-APPS package, which includes applets that will work with
both AfterStep and Window Maker window managers.
