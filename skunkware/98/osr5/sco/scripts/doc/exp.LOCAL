          eeeexxxxpppp processes an expenses file.  The expenses file consists
          of records describing expenses which were payed for by
          certain parties and which are owed for by some other set of
          parties.  eeeexxxxpppp uses information on who payed for each expense
          and who the parties to the expense were to calculate, for
          each party, a net amount of money owed by or to a
          coordinator.  For simplicity, all balances are calculated
          relative to the coordinator.  A net amount owed by a party
          is shown as a positive amount owed by that party to the
          coordinator; a net amount owed to a party is shown as a
          negative amount owed by that party to the coordinator.
          After the file has been processed, the amounts owed are
          printed.  The only users reported on are those who are
          currently in the AAAAllllllll set (see below) and those who have an
          outstanding balance whose absolute value is greater than or
          equal to the minimum report balance, by default $0.02.  This
          can be changed with the -M option.

              Process only records that match one of the comma-
              separated types in <payment-type>.  Payment types
              consist of one character from _b_t and/or one from _p_n.  _b
              and _t select records which include any of the parties
              given with -p in the owed-by or owed-to field
              respectively; they should only be used if -p is given.
              If a party is in both the owed-by and owed-to fields, _b
              will select the record if the party represents a larger
              fraction of the owed-by field than the owed-to field,
              while _t will do the opposite of this.  If the party
              represents the same fraction of both fields, it is not
              selected in either case.  _p and _n select records which
              have a positive or negative amount respectively.  If
              both a character from _b_t and a character from _p_n are
              given in one payment type (e.g.  _b_p), both of the
              conditions specified must be true for a record to match
              that payment-type specifier.  If more than one payment-
              type is given (e.g.  _b,_t_n), a record will be selected if
              it matches any of the payment types.  A payment type of
              _P is short for _b_p,_t_n which selects records that specify
              a net positive amount owed by one of the -p parties; _N
              is short for the opposite of this.

              part of the expense system is printed, in various units
              (days, weeks, months, and years).  This is derived from
              the assignments to AAAAllllllll, so every AAAAllllllll assignment must
              have a date in order for this option to be used.  This
              is followed by a breakdown of expenses that the party
              was party to, by expense type.  For each expense type,
              the total amount is printed, along with the average by
              day, week, month, and year.  The expense types are the
              same as those described for the -P option, and
              conglomerations of them.  The expense types are:

                   field, and vice versa.

                   and which resulted in a net credit to the party

          separated by commas.  It may also specify that some parties
          are to be subtracted, e.g. AAAAllllllll----FFFFoooooooo is a list of parties that

          it is not used.  The default field separator <sep> is one or
          more tabs or spaces, except that the separator immediately
          before the comment field must be a tab so that spaces in the
          comment won't cause the first word of the comment field to
          be interpreted as the optional PPPPUUUURRRRCCCCHHHHAAAASSSSEEEERRRRSSSS field (by default,
          only the comment field can contain spaces).  If the field
          separator is changed, none of this special behaviour
          applies.

          Lines of the form vvvvaaaarrrr=vvvvaaaalllluuuueeee assign values to variables.
          Variable assignments may be preceded by a date.  This can
          make it easier to sort the file.  However, the date of an
          assignment is used only for assignments to the AAAAllllllll variable
          (see below).  The value of the variable YYYYeeeeaaaarrrr is used for
          lines that do not include a year in the date. YYYYeeeeaaaarrrr need not
          be assigned a value if all dates include a year or if the ----pppp
          and ----VVVV options will not be used.  The variable SSSSeeeepppp can be
          used to define a field separator.  It should be a regular
          expression in the manner of aaaawwwwkkkk.  For example, to make the
          field separator be one or more tabs, use
          Sep=\t+
          If the variable OwedBy is set, expenses lines should not
          included a PARTIES field.  All expenses will be charged to
          the party specified by the OwedBy variable.  If the variable
          OwedTo is set, expenses lines should not included a
          PURCHASERS field, and the separator before the comment field
          need not be a tab.  All expenses will be charged to the
          party specified by the OwedTo variable.  Any other variable
          assignments define aliases which may be used whereever
          parties are.  The value part should have the form:
          name,name,name...  Aliases may reference other aliases but
          there must not be any loops.  Aliases may be redefined
          throughout the file.  Aliases that are defined before any
          expense records are printed before the column header is
          printed.

          The special alias AAAAllllllll must be set before any expense records
          occur.  Any names that occur either directly or in other
          aliases must exist in AAAAllllllll; it determines what names are
          valid.  The first name on the right hand side of the first
          definition of AAAAllllllll is that of the coordinator, with respect
          to whom all balances are calculated.  All names are case-
          insensitive.  The first instance of a name determines the
          case with which it is printed.  Assigments to AAAAllllllll should
          generally include a date, because the ----VVVV (verbose) option
          uses the period in which each party was a member of AAAAllllllll to
          determine the amount of time that the party was part of the
          expenses system, so that averages by time may be calculated.
          If any AAAAllllllll assignment does not include a date, the ----VVVV option
