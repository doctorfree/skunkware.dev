"$0: concatenate lines into records.
Usage: $0 [filename ...]
$0 reads files consisting of records, concatenates each record
into a single line, and writes each line onto the standard output.
Records consist of lines.  A record is continued onto the next line by
ending it with a \, optionally followed by spaces or tabs.
The continuatation \, along with any following spaces and tabs,
is converted into a space in the output."

# Read a line.  
# If the line is continued 
# (it ends with a \, possibly followed by spaces and tabs),
# then append the next line of input, replace the \, spaces, tabs, and
# embedded newline with a space, and branch to the beginning of the
# script without writing anything.
# If the line is not continued, the take the default sed action 
# (write the pattern space, delete it, read the next line, and go to
# the beginning of the script).
