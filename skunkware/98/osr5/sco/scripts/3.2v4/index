scripts/3.2v4/
Interpreted programs for 3.2v4, mostly ksh and gawk scripts.
These were created for SCO UNIX 3.2v4 or earlier and either don't work or are
no longer needed under 3.2v5.  Most should be portable to other flavors of UNIX
without too much trouble.  If you don't have ksh for the #!/bin/ksh scripts,
try pd-ksh, bash, or zsh.  For the gawk scripts, use version 2.15.5 or later. 
A gawk 3.0.0 binary for SCO 5.0 can be found in the scobins/3.2v4/ directory.
