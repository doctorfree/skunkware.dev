1) Introduction
---------------

1.1)  Conventions

 - Direct quotations begin with an attribution in a standard format,
   and are indented by four spaces.
 
 
 - Pointers to resources available via the Internet, such as references
   to FTPable goodies, appear in WWW URL format.  URLs beginning with
   "ftp:" refer to FTP sites.  For example:
 
   ftp://domain.name/path/to/package
 
   Those with FTP access, but without WWW access, may treat such
   references as follows:
 
   1. Log into host domain.name using anonymous FTP
   2. Look for /path/to/package
 
   An FTP reference usually lists only the distribution site; please
   try your nearest FTP archive first.  Archie may be of some help
   here.
 
   Here is a brief summary of URL prefixes:

   http:        refers to a WWW server
   gopher:      refers to a gopher server
   ftp:         refers to an anonymous FTP server
   mailto:      refers to an Internet e-mail address
   news:        refers to a USENET news group
 
   Internet browsing tools, such as Mosaic, know about URLs.
 
 
 - You'll occasionally see text in braces, like this.
 
   { Here is some example meta-text. }
 
   Sometimes, this indicates a place where information is missing, or
   where the information may be unreliable, or where major changes are
   planned in the near future.  You can ignore these if you're just
   looking for information.  But if you can help fill in the gaps, and
   you want to achieve fame, fortune, and your name at the bottom of
   this FAQ, please send e-mail to the maintainer.

1.2)  Where can I get the MMDF FAQ?


 - It is posted approximately monthly to the MMDF2 mailing list
   (mailto:mmdf2-request@a.cs.okstate.edu) and to the USENET
   newsgroup comp.mail.misc.

   Unfortunately, there is presently no FTP-able archive source
   for old MMDF2 list messages.

 
 - Many sites archive news.answers postings, including these:
   
   ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/news.answers/mail/mmdf-faq/
   ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet-by-group/news.answers/mail/mmdf-faq/
   
   If possible, please try to find a closer site; for example, by
   asking archie for "mmdf-faq".  Alternatively, use WWW search
   engines to look for the MMDF FAQ.
   
 
 - If you are reading this FAQ via some fixed medium such as hardcopy
   or CD-ROM, please try to obtain the latest edition from the net
   instead.

2) What is MMDF?
----------------

MMDF is the Multi-channel Memo Distribution Facility, a popular mail
transport agent (MTA) for UNIX.

Strong points of MMDF include:

  - Native user-level mail delivery control (".maildelivery").
  - Ability to turn up and down logging/debugging levels on the fly.
  - Authentication and permission checking.
  - Mail blocking based on from whom it came, how it got there,
        and to whom it is going.
  - Modularity: it's relatively easy to add new transport and
        translation channels for special e-mail gateways.
  - High capacity: it's designed to process very large message flows
        and can efficiently handle very large message queues.
  
MMDF may have special appeal to persons in the UK, in that MMDF knows
how to handle mail addresses in the UK-endian order, 
e.g. "edu.okstate.cs.a", as well as in the more widespread format,
e.g. "a.cs.okstate.edu".

MMDF is the standard mail system on at least one UNIX implementation,
SCO UNIX.  However, MMDF does not enjoy deployment as widespread as
some other MTAs, such as sendmail.  This is partly because, as
Marshall Rose says in his book, _The Internet Message_, MMDF suffers
from a tyranny of complexity: it requires configurations of many
different files and daemons.  In contrast, sendmail uses one daemon
and one central configuration file.

Sendmail, on the other hand, has its own set of disadvantages, and in
many (if not most) implementations sendmail is not nearly as correct,
secure, modular, or robust a message transfer agent as is MMDF.
Sendmail was once compared by one old Internet hand to "those killer
bees that escaped from the laboratory--and now they're everywhere and
you can't get rid of 'em".  Sendmail is still widely disparaged by
experienced mail system administrators, although perhaps less
deservedly so now than in the past.

--

2.1)  How MMDF is used

MMDF works on the principle of passing messages between incoming and
outgoing communications channels.

In MMDF, a channel is typically implemented as a program for accepting
messages from a Mail User Agent, say, via SMTP, or for delivering
messages to a local mailbox file or to another host.  (In sendmail
parlance, these are called "mailers".)

MMDF is typically run by starting up a set of persistent daemons named
"deliver", each daemon managing delivery to a different channel, or to
a set of channels.  Other daemons are also involved, such as "smtpd",
which monitors the SMTP port, and arranges for submissions and
deliveries via SMTP.

Here is a UNIX "ps" snapshot of MMDF processes running at a relatively
simply-configured Internet site, including SMTP, POP, "delay",
"local", and "list" channels, as well as one local relay channel named
"laurel":

 UID   PID  PPID  C    STIME TTY TIME COMMAND
mmdf  8306     1  0  Jan 16  ?   0:07 lib/deliver -b -T120 -clocal
mmdf   154     1  0  Dec  8  ?   0:11 lib/deliver -b -T120 -csmtp
mmdf   155     1  0  Dec  8  ?   2:34 lib/deliver -b -T120 -cpop
mmdf   156     1  0  Dec  8  ?   0:13 lib/deliver -b -T120 -clist
mmdf   157     1  0  Dec  8  ?   0:10 lib/deliver -b -T120 -claurel
mmdf  8338     1  0  Jan 16  ?   0:02 lib/deliver -b -T300 -cdelay
root   152     1  0  Dec  8  ?   0:44 chans/smtpd -n 16 chans/smtpsrvr smtp,local

Channels are managed by a set of configuration files, aka "tables",
one or more per channel.  Address rewriting is done according to a set
of compiled-in rules, configured by each channel's table.  The table
formats themselves are relatively simple; understanding their effects
may not be so simple.

Because MMDF's documentation was written when the Internet DNS was
brand-new, it is somewhat vague or diffuse on the subject of specific
configurations for typical modern Internet e-mail sites.  The closest
match to a typical Internet site's configuration in the MMDF 2.43
source release is in the samples/bbn directory.

The current MMDF source release is otherwise tragically short of
working configuration examples for use in today's Internet, in which
DNS lookups may time out or provide bad information, maildrops may
exist on temporarily unavailable NFS-mounted directories, and other
gotchas may provide general interference in the smooth operation of
your mail system.  This FAQ is one place to find help.  Appeals
to the MMDF2 list can also yield helpful information.

Your best bet for understanding how to set up MMDF is to look at the
sample configurations and an already-running configuration.  Reading
all of the available documentation is also a must (see the doc/
subdirectory in the MMDF source distribution).

2.2)  Where to get MMDF

The most recent release of MMDF is available here:

        ftp://a.cs.okstate.edu:/pub/mmdf-2.43.tar.Z

This is the core version of MMDF, presently maintained by 
Mark J. Vasoll, Senior Software Specialist, Oklahoma State
University.

The current offical version of MMDF is 2.43.


A mailing list for MMDF discussion is here:

2.3)  A brief history of MMDF

{ Contributed by Dave Crocker <dcrocker@brandenburg.com> 21-Jan-1996;
  cruelly simplified, edited, and dehydrated by the FAQ maintainer
  from Dave's much juicier version, which may be reconstituted here
  at some future date. }
    
1976: Early morning on the ARPANET.  Dave Farber and Dave Crocker
      work at RAND (the think tank) on "MS", a PDP-11 UNIX e-mail
      system project.   This inspires Bruce Borden to create MH,
      the popular mail user agent.
    
1978: Dave Farber and Dave Crocker go to the University of Delaware
      (UDel) as professor and grad student.  Grad student Ed
      Szurkowski writes phonenet protocol for telephone-based
      link-level transfer.  Crocker develops MMDF to provide ARPANET
      e-mail connectivity over phonenet, using RAND as a relay.

1979: Experimental deployment of MMDF/phonenet by Army Materiel
      Command; there are claimed to be instances still running today.
      IBM provides some additional funding for MMDF.
    
1980: NSF funds creation of CSNet.  MMDF I is used to link members,
      using UDel and RAND as relays.  Others get involved: Doug
      Kingston (Ballistic Research Labs) and Steve Kille (University
      College London).
    
1981: Ira Winston (University of Pennsylvania) recodes MMDF I in
      Pascal to create PMDF running under VAX/VMS.  

1982: Crocker finishes alpha version of MMDF II, which adds TCP/IP
      and DNS support, among other things.  Mark Laubach propagates
      PMDF to Hewlett-Packard.  Ned Freed commercializes PMDF.

1984: Kingston, Kille, Dan Long (BBN), and Craig Partridge (BBN)
      complete MMDF II and release it.

1985: Kille uses MMDF as a base for the PP X.400 system.

3) User-Level Questions
-----------------------

3.1) How can I achieve the same effect as the sendmail .forward file?

Invoke the MMDF resend program in your $HOME/.maildelivery file.  
See also the resend(1) man page.

Here is an example .maildelivery file entry using resend:

  default - | A "/usr/local/mmdf/bin/resend metoo@host.domain"

Beware of resend's .signature file format expectations (see question
3.5).

If you're an MH user, you might want to invoke the rcvdist program in
your $HOME/.maildelivery file instead.  See also the mhook(1) man
page.

Example:

  default - | A "/usr/local/lib/mh/rcvdist metoo@host.domain"

The rcvdist program is somewhat finicky about header formats, and
may reject a message if improperly formed Date or recipient address
fields are present.

--

3.2) Is there a more powerful .maildelivery-like mechanism with
     Boolean operators and such?

Yes, there are several such programs that you might invoke as a "*" or
a "default" case in your .maildelivery file.

Some examples (from the comp.mail.misc "UNIX Email Software Survey FAQ"):

What:           mailagent
Where:          ftp://ftp.univ-lyon1.fr/pub/unix/mail/tools/mailagent-3.0.tar.gz
Comments:       A set of programs to perform various e-mail sorting functions.
See also:       news:comp.mail.misc
                "UNIX Email Software Survey FAQ [Part 3 of 3]"


What:           majordomo
Where:          ftp://ftp.greatcircle.com/pub/majordomo/
Comments:       Majordomo is a perl-based program for automated
                mailing list maintenance.

    [ Andy Powell <ccsap@bath.ac.uk> - 23-Jan-1996 ]

    I believe that there is also a patch required for the sendmail
    replacement if you want to use majordomo with MMDF.  The patch
    is only required if you want to use majordomo's 'resend'
    script to process list messages.  We run majordomo and MMDF
    here but use the normal MMDF list channel to process list
    messages - in doing so we lose some of the functionality of
    majordomo, for example moderated lists, but bypass the
    sendmail problem and, arguably, get better performance with
    large lists.

    There may also be more information available from the archives of the
    majordomo-users@greatcircle.com and majordomo-workers@greatcircle.com
    lists.  In both cases send the word "help" (no quotes, put it in the
    body rather than the subject) to majordomo@greatcircle.com to start
    the process.

    [ Gunther Anderson <gunther@world.std.com> 5-Aug-1994 ]

    In getting Majordomo to work properly, I discovered a bug in [MMDF's]
    sendmail, as found in uip/other/sendmail.c.  Basically, the real
    sendmail handles the -f{sender} flag differently.  In standard
    sendmail, the -f flag changes the "From " header (the envelope From,
    and the Mail From: command in SMTP), and doesn't touch the "From:"
    header, the message From:.  In RFC822 messages, these can indeed be
    very different from each other, and Majordomo uses them to separate
    ends.  MMDF's sendmail stub deliberately chooses to use the -f
    parameter as both the envelope From and the message From:, rewriting
    the message From: as it goes.  I removed the automatic From: rewriting
    from my version, and things like Majordomo are much happier.

    [ Gunther W Anderson <gunther@world.std.com> 24-Jan-1996 ]

    I posted instructions and a couple of patches to majordomo-workers
    year before last.  These were for Majordomo 1.92, and were
    specifically designed to get Majordomo to work on SCO Unix.  As a side
    effect, it also patched MMDF II 43b (the current version) to work
    properly.  Check out the archives, and you'll find the data.

3.3) How can I debug my .maildelivery file?

    [ Craig Partridge <craig@aland.bbn.com> 24-Jan-1996 ]

    I used to debug it by running the local channel by hand with
    "deliver -w -clocal" and watched the output to see what
    .maildelivery did.

--

3.4) Why doesn't my .maildelivery file work?

MMDF is finicky about ownerships and permissions.  Make sure that
your .maildelivery file is (a) in your home directory, (b) owned
by you, and (c) not writeable by anyone except you (e.g. chmod 644).

--

3.5) Why does "resend" bounce with the error "No valid author
     specification present"?

This is caused by "resend" rejecting your .signature file.  If you use
"resend", then your .signature file must conform to its expectations.

Unfortunately, the MMDF "resend" program has a different idea about
.signature files than USENET news and most other things.  Resend
assumes that the .signature file contains exactly one text line, which
is information to be placed in the outgoing message's From: field's
full name area.

----

4) Administrator-Level Questions
--------------------------------

4.1) How can I arrange for a "hidden-host" effect, e.g. that outgoing
     "From" addresses of the form user@<host>.<domain> are rewritten
     simply as "user@<domain>"?

    [ Mark Vasoll <vasoll@a.cs.okstate.edu> - 22-Jan-1996 ]

    Answer #1: use the MLOCMACHINE feature (see section 5.4.1 of
    "Installing and Operating MMDF II").
    
    Answer #2: use the POP channel to create a sort of "virtual host"
    where pop users don't need to have accounts on the MMDF host.

    We are doing both on the okstate campus, I'd be happy to send
    along config examples.

Depending on how the MTA itself modifies message headers, it may not
be possible to hide the originating host without reconfiguration of
the MTA.

If you use MH, some experimentation with the mtstailor file may also
be required, specifically, with the "servers:" entry in the mtstailor
file, or MH may have to be compiled with the DUMB configuration option.

--

4.2) How can I deliver mail to a POP mailbox?

You need to set up the POP channel and an alias for each user that
directs the mail to an address of the form "<popuser>@POP".

Users with local non-POP maildrops may also do this for themselves by
re-sending to their own POP addresses from their .maildelivery files.

{ Specific tailor, channel, and alias file examples might be
  useful here. }

--

4.3) Is there a way to make MMDF look up local hosts if DNS name
     service fails?

    [ Mark Vasoll <vasoll@a.cs.okstate.edu> - 22-Jan-1996 ]

    Create a channel running the 'smtp' channel program, but
    using a file style table.  Then put IP addresses in it.

--

4.4) How can I avoid generating source-routed envelope addresses,
     such as @foo,bar:zot.edu?

This may occur when some SMTP implementations see a different host
named in the HELO command than is actually submitting the e-mail.

Fixing this may require a two-pronged approach: configuring your
"local" channel table properly { ...any specific advice for a typical
Internet site? }  and configuring your mail user agent to submit
mail to a host listed in the "local" channel table.  For MH, the
latter may require a "servers:" entry in the mtstailor file.

{ This needs more specific, more accurate advice. }

--

4.5) Why do I get duplicate mail sent to a mailing list?
  
    [ Dave Barr <barr@math.psu.edu> ]
    
    MMDF 2.43's list channel verifies the validity of the whole mailing
    list before returning from the Submit call.  The thing calling Submit
    may time out and close, while leaving Submit itself running.
    
    The calling routine may believe that the message has failed in its
    delivery, when in fact the still-running Submit process may eventually
    succeed. The calling process tries again some time later, thus
    creating a duplicate.
    
    The larger the list gets, the more addresses there are to verify
    (verification just being a DNS search on the target machine name),
    and the more likely, under load, that the message duplicates.
    
    One solution is to use a different channel for submission and
    delivery, one which deliberately doesn't verify the addresses before
    accepting a job.  Use the list-processor channel to check that the
    listname-request name is set properly (because list-processor insists
    on making listname-request the envelope "From " header name).
    
    Duplicate mail on Linux may be caused by the broken flock()
    implementation under some (<1.3.x?) versions of Linux.  
    Avoid flock().

--

4.6) How do I gate a list to and/or from a newsgroup?

{ Any examples? I know that UCI has come up with a pretty good way
  to do this. }

----

5) Miscellaneous Questions and Gotchas
--------------------------------------

5.1) What new features are planned for the next release of MMDF?

    [ Mark Vasoll <vasoll@a.cs.okstate.edu> - 22-Jan-1996 ]

    - Full RFC 1123 compliance  (existing deviations are very minor).
        { RFC 1123: "Requirements for Internet hosts - application
          and support".  ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1123.txt }
    - MIME encapsulation of error/warning messages and citations.
    - Completely revamped #ifdef structure on a "per OS feature" basis
        (no more BSD vs Sys5, since they don't really exist anymore).
    - Completely new example configurations based on "current" systems
        (I have Sequent Dynix/PTX, Sun SunOS, Sun Solaris, IBM RS6000 AIX,
         Novell Unixware and Linux in house).
    - GDBM support for tables
    
    The time table for any new release is not known.  This is an unfunded
    spare time project for me.  What remains to be done is mailing the
    #ifdef revisions in the user interfaces (the core code is complete)
    and a revision of the "building" section of the documentation.


5.2) MMDF sendmail-replacement gotchas

    [ Andy Powell <ccsap@bath.ac.uk> - 23-Jan-1996 ]

    The sendmail supplied with MMDF is slightly defective in that it
    doesn't correctly hide Bcc: fields (if given a -t option).  This
    can cause a problem for non-MMDF UAs (for example, Pine) if they
    are configured to send mail out using sendmail.
    
    In the case of Pine I suspect that this can be worked round by
    configuring it to talk directly to the MMDF smtpd running on
    localhost (assuming that you are running one).

on brief entries that are provided in the existing entry format, but
it's fair simply to offer corrections or updated information.

PP is a large-scale X.400/SMTP mailer and gateway.  The last
non-commercial version was PP 6.0 (ca. 1992), which is still available
for downloading from some Internet sites; one is listed above.  PP has
since been folded into a commercial software suite from the ISODE
Consortium; see the entry for "ISODE Consortium MTA", below.

7.2)  Commercial Software

This section is for listings of commercial software based on MMDF,
or that provides enhancements to MMDF.

Contributions to this section may be made by anyone, including the
firms offering the packages.  The FAQ maintainers look with favor on
_brief_ entries, preferably as non-hypeful as possible, that are
provided in the existing entry format, but it's fair simply to offer
corrections, updated information, or unbiased consumer-oriented
comments.  Send new or updated entries to the address
"mmdf-faq@irvine.com"; posting to the MMDF2 list isn't necessarily
sufficient.

    { This entry has been brutally edited from the much longer version
      originally contributed to the comp.mail.mime FAQ. }

    The ISODE Consortium MTA is an X.400 and SMTP mailer, and a gateway
    between these, so  you can communicate with "both worlds".  This
    product is based on the older public domain PP MTA, but now includes
    many enhancements and features.
    
    The ISODE Consortium product is a source release.  Binary Products
    based on the technology are available from commercial vendors who are
    members of the ISODE Consortium.

8) Authorship
-------------

The MMDF FAQ was boilerplated partially from the comp.mail.mime FAQ,
originally by Ed Vielmetti.  The cast of contributors to that FAQ is
credited therein.

Some MMDF-specific text was cribbed from these sources:

Where:          news:comp.mail.misc
Source Subject: UNIX Email Software Survey FAQ [Part 3 of 3]
From:           clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca (Chris Lewis)
Section:        MMDF
                from a review by I.Sparry@gdt.bath.ac.uk

Where:          news:comp.mail.misc
Source Subject: Majordomo Frequently Asked Questions
From:           barr@math.psu.edu (Dave Barr)
Section:        WHY DO I GET DUPLICATE MAIL SENT TO THE LIST?
                by Gunther Anderson

The MMDF FAQ's current maintainer is Jerry Sweet <mmdf-faq@irvine.com>.

Please note:

  Questions about MMDF and related issues, if not already answered in
  the FAQ, should be posted to comp.mail.misc or to the mmdf2 mailing
  list (see section 2.2 for its request address).

  Correspondence sent to the MMDF FAQ maintainer primarily should
  address information in the MMDF FAQ---corrections, additions, or
  suggestions for improvement.
