# This program produces as its output a mapchan file which lets you configure
# any tty (console/serial/whatever) to translate the sequence
# control-B x x
# where x is a hex-char 0-9a-f into the character whose 8-bit value is xx.
# Because you can only map 255 compose-key/dead-key sequences, it only works
# with the hex chars given in lower case.  Also, ^B00 is not mapped because you
# cannot map to a null char.  I mapped hex sequences rather than decimal
# sequences because you can only have one compose character and it can only be
# followed by 2 characters.  Change the "2" after compose to some other value
# to set the compose character to something other than ^B.  Note that this uses
# up the compose character/dead key mapping space, so if you are currently
# using mapchan for input with a compose character or dead key you cannot use
# this unless you reduce the number of sequences mapped.  You might change the
# loop to
# (i = 128; ...
# to only map the high-bit characters.
