# @(#) ProcArgs 1.11 96/12/08
# 92/02/29 john h. dubois iii (john@armory.com)
# 93/07/18 Added "#" arg type
# 93/09/26 Do not count -h against MinArgs
# 94/01/01 Stop scanning at first non-option arg.  Added ">" option type.
#          Removed meaning of "+" or "-" by itself.
# 94/03/08 Added & option and *()< option types.
# 94/04/02 Added NoRCopt to Opts()
# 94/06/11 Mark numeric variables as such.
# 94/07/08 Opts(): Do not require any args if h option is given.
# 95/01/22 Record options given more than once.  Record option num in argv.
# 95/06/08 Added ExclusiveOptions().
# 96/01/20 Let rcfiles be a colon-separated list of filenames.
#          Expand $VARNAME at the start of its filenames.
#          Let varname=0 and -option- turn off an option.
# 96/05/05 Changed meaning of 7th arg to Opts; now can specify exactly how many
#          of the vars should be searched for in the environment.
#          Check for duplicate rcfiles.
# 96/05/13 Return more specific error values.  Note: ProcArgs() and InitOpts()
#          now return various negatives values on error, not just -1, and
#          Opts() may set Err to various positive values, not just 1.
#          Added AllowUnrecOpt.
# 96/05/23 Check type given for & option
# 96/06/15 Re-port to awk
# 96/10/01 Moved file-reading code into ReadConfFile(), so that it can be
#          used by other functions.
# 96/10/15 Added OptChars
# 96/11/01 Added exOpts arg to Opts()
# 96/11/16 Added ; type
# 96/12/08 Added Opt2Set() & Opt2Sets()
# 96/12/27 Added CmdLineOpt()

# optlist is a string which contains all of the possible command line options.
# A character followed by certain characters indicates that the option takes
# an argument, with type as follows:
# :	String argument
# ;	Non-empty string argument
# *	Floating point argument
# (	Non-negative floating point argument
# )	Positive floating point argument
# #	Integer argument
# <	Non-negative integer argument
# >	Positive integer argument
# The only difference the type of argument makes is in the runtime argument
# error checking that is done.

# The & option is a special case used to get numeric options without the
# user having to give an option character.  It is shorthand for [-+.0-9].
# If & is included in optlist and an option string that begins with one of
# these characters is seen, the value given to "&" will include the first
# char of the option.  & must be followed by a type character other than ":"
# or ";".
# Note that if e.g. &> is given, an option of -.5 will produce an error.

# Strings in argv[] which begin with "-" or "+" are taken to be
# strings of options, except that a string which consists solely of "-"
# or "+" is taken to be a non-option string; like other non-option strings,
# it stops the scanning of argv and is left in argv[].
# An argument of "--" or "++" also stops the scanning of argv[] but is removed.
# If an option takes an argument, the argument may either immediately
# follow it or be given separately.
# "-" and "+" options are treated the same.  "+" is allowed because most awks
# take any -options to be arguments to themselves.  gawk 2.15 was enhanced to
# stop scanning when it encounters an unrecognized option, though until 2.15.5
# this feature had a flaw that caused problems in some cases.  See the OptChars
# parameter to explicitly set the option-specifier characters.

# If an option that does not take an argument is given,
# an index with its name is created in Options and its value is set to the
# number of times it occurs in argv[].

# If an option that does take an argument is given, an index with its name is
# created in Options and its value is set to the value of the argument given
# for it, and Options[option-name,"count"] is (initially) set to the 1.
# If an option that takes an argument is given more than once,
# Options[option-name,"count"] is incremented, and the value is assigned to
# the index (option-name,instance) where instance is 2 for the second occurance
# of the option, etc.
# In other words, the first time an option with a value is encountered, the
# value is assigned to an index consisting only of its name; for any further
# occurances of the option, the value index has an extra (count) dimension.

# The sequence number for each option found in argv[] is stored in
# Options[option-name,"num",instance], where instance is 1 for the first
# occurance of the option, etc.  The sequence number starts at 1 and is
# incremented for each option, both those that have a value and those that
# do not.  Options set from a config file have a value of 0 assigned to this.

# Options and their arguments are deleted from argv.
# Note that this means that there may be gaps left in the indices of argv[].
# If compress is nonzero, argv[] is packed by moving its elements so that
# they have contiguous integer indices starting with 0.
# Option processing will stop with the first unrecognized option, just as
# though -- was given except that unlike -- the unrecognized option will not be
# removed from ARGV[].  Normally, an error value is returned in this case.
# If AllowUnrecOpt is true, it is not an error for an unrecognized option to
# be found, so the number of remaining arguments is returned instead.
# If OptChars is not a null string, it is the set of characters that indicate
# that an argument is an option string if the string begins with one of the
# characters.  A string consisting solely of two of the same option-indicator
# characters stops the scanning of argv[].  The default is "-+".
# argv[0] is not examined.
# The number of arguments left in argc is returned.
# If an error occurs, the global string OptErr is set to an error message
# and a negative value is returned.
# Current error values:
# -1: option that required an argument did not get it.
# -2: argument of incorrect type supplied for an option.
# -3: unrecognized (invalid) option.

# Note: only the above functions are needed by ProcArgs.

# option-processing stuff.

# Opts: Process command line arguments.
# Opts processes command line arguments using ProcArgs()
# and checks for errors.  If an error occurs, a message is printed
# and the program is exited.
#
# Input variables:
# Name is the name of the program, for error messages.
# Usage is a usage message, for error messages.
# OptList the option description string, as used by ProcArgs().
# MinArgs is the minimum number of non-option arguments that this
# program should have, non including ARGV[0] and +h.
# If the program does not require any non-option arguments,
# MinArgs should be omitted or given as 0.
# rcFiles, if given, is a colon-seprated list of filenames to read for
# variable initialization.  If a filename begins with ~/, the ~ is replaced
# by the value of the environment variable HOME.  If a filename begins with
# $, the part from the character after the $ up until (but not including)
# the first character not in [a-zA-Z0-9_] will be searched for in the
# environment; if found its value will be substituted, if not the filename will
# be discarded.
# rcfiles are read in the order given.
# Values given in them will not override values given on the command line,
# and values given in later files will not override those set in earlier
# files, because AssignVal() will store each with a different instance index.
# The first instance of each variable, either on the command line or in an
# rcfile, will be stored with no instance index, and this is the value
# normally used by programs that call this function.
# VarNames is a comma-separated list of variable names to map to options,
# in the same order as the options are given in OptList.
# If EnvSearch is given and nonzero, the first EnvSearch variables will also be
# searched for in the environment.  If set to -1, all values will be searched
# for in the environment.  Values given in the environment will override
# those given in the rcfiles but not those given on the command line.
# NoRCopt, if given, is an additional letter option that if given on the
# command line prevents the rcfiles from being read.
# See ProcArgs() for a description of AllowUnRecOpt and optChars, and
# ExclusiveOptions() for a description of exOpts.
# Special options:
# If x is made an option and is given, some debugging info is output.
# h is assumed to be the help option.

# Global variables:
# The command line arguments are taken from ARGV[].
# The arguments that are option specifiers and values are removed from
# ARGV[], leaving only ARGV[0] and the non-option arguments.
# The number of elements in ARGV[] should be in ARGC.
# After processing, ARGC is set to the number of elements left in ARGV[].
# The option values are put in Options[].
# On error, Err is set to a positive integer value so it can be checked for in
# an END block.
# Return value: The number of elements left in ARGV is returned.
# Must keep OptErr global since it may be set by InitOpts().
