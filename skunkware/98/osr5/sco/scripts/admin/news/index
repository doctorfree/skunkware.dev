Usenet News utilities.  These were written to help maintain a C-News system
running under SCO 3.2v4.  Some of them are useful for other news systems than
C-News.  Most should be portable to other flavors of UNIX without too much
trouble.  If you don't have ksh for the #!/bin/ksh scripts, try pd-ksh, bash,
or zsh.  Many of them require gawk, version 2.15.5 or later.  Some require
gawk 3.0.0 or later.  A gawk 3.0.0 binary for SCO 5.0 can be found in the
scobins/ directory.
