scripts/mail/
Utilities for dealing with mail, mostly ksh and gawk scripts.  These
were written for SCO XENIX and SCO UNIX, but most should be portable to other
flavors of UNIX without too much trouble.  If you don't have ksh for the
#!/bin/ksh scripts, try pd-ksh, bash, or zsh.  For the gawk scripts, use
version 2.15.5 or later. A gawk 3.0.0 binary for SCO 5.0 can be found in the
scobins/ directory.
Many of these programs are specific to the MMDF mail transport agent.  For
example, they may expect MMDF style message separators (each message preceded
and followed by a line consisting of four control-A characters), or may depend
on the existence of programs that are part of the MMDF system (execmail,
checkque, etc.)  In some cases, porting the utility to a different MTA will be
fairly straightforward, assuming you know the language the utility is written
in.
