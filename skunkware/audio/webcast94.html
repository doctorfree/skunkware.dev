On August 23rd, 1994 SCO broadcast a live music concert from
the Cowell Courtyard at the University of California in
Santa Cruz. This event, part of SCO Forum 1994, was the first
time a live musical performance was broadcast over the Internet
utilizing the emerging World Wide Web.
<P>
The band was Deth Specula, a group composed of SCO employees,
and the first song ever broadcast over the Internet was a
parody of the <A HREF="http://www.grandfunkrailroad.com">Grand Funk Railroad</A>
song "We're An American Band".
Deth Specula sang "We Are An Internet Band" with lyrics like:
<PRE>
    "We're comin' to your town
     To bring your network down
     We are an Internet band."
</PRE>
Today, SCO continues in that tradition by sponsoring and producing
a series of live Internet webcasts from the popular Santa Cruz night 
club <A HREF="http://www.sco.com/palookaville">Palookaville.</A> 
These webcasts demonstrate the use of UnixWare 7 
as a real-time audio and video webcasting server utilizing the 
RealAudio and RealVideo technologies from <A HREF="http://www.real.com">
RealNetworks</A>.
