      <p> <b><a name="q0a">What is SCO Skunkware?</a></b> 
      <p> SCO Skunkware is a collection of useful and entertaining software for 
        use on SCO platforms. The CD-ROM contains many public domain or freely 
        distributable programs including the GNU C Compiler, GNU utilities, audio 
        drivers, Technical Library Supplements, graphics libraries, games, audio 
        and video tools, graphics utilities, and much much more. 
      <p> There is a <a href="/skunkware/intro/">slide presentation</a> on Skunkware, 
        it's history, contents, etc which Ronald Joe Record presented at <a href="http://www.sco.com/forum98/conference/grid.html">SCO 
        Forum 98</a> 
      <p> The <a href="/skunkware">current release of SCO Skunkware</a> is intended 
        for use on SCO OpenServer and SCO UnixWare. <a href="/skunkware/index.html"> 
        Previous releases of SCO Skunkware </a> provided tools ported to SCO ODT, 
        SCO UNIX 3.2v4, and even SCO Xenix. 
      <p> <a href="#top"> [top]</a> 
      <p> <b><a name="q0">How do I order the SCO Skunkware CD-ROM?</a></b> 
      <p> The currently shipping SCO Skunkware CD-ROM may be ordered from <a href="http://www.sco.com/offers"> 
        our on-line ordering system</a> which has been updated to include SCO 
        Skunkware 98. There is no additional media, shipping or handling charge 
        for SCO Skunkware when ordered in conjunction with any of the other SCO 
        "free" product offerings. 
      <p> Previous releases of SCO Skunkware are no longer available on CD-ROM, 
        but may be downloaded from our <a href="/skunkware/index.html"> 
        previous release web/ftp site</a>. 
      <p> <a href="#top"> [top]</a> 
      <p> <b><a name="q1">How do I locate a particular SCO Skunkware component?</a></b> 
      <p> To download a particular component you first have to locate the download 
        directory for that component. The SCO Skunkware team has tried to provide 
        intuitive categories of components. For instance, if you were looking 
        for Vim, the improved visual text editor, you could click on <a href=/skunkware/editors/index.html>Editors</a> 
        from the <a href=/skunkware/index.html>Category Selection</a> page. 
      <p> Similarly, the SCO Skunkware ftp hierarchy has been organized by functional 
        category within operating system platform. For instance, to find the SCO 
        OpenServer "vim" distribution via ftp, you would establish an anonymous 
        ftp connection to <a href="ftp://ftp.sco.com">ftp.sco.com</a> and look 
        in the directory <a href="ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/osr5/editors/"> 
        /skunkware/osr5/editors</a>. There you would find a subdirectory called 
        vim. To locate the SCO UnixWare vim distribution, you would look in the 
        directory <a href="ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/uw2/editors/"> /skunkware/uw2/editors</a>. 
      <p> You can also locate a Skunkware component by <a href="http://search.sco.com/">searching 
        the HTML documents on www.sco.com</a>. 
      <p> <a href="#top"> [top]</a> 
      <p> <b><a name="q2">How do I download "xyz" for SCO OpenServer?</a></b> 
      <p> Make sure to download files in binary mode when using ftp. To download 
        with your web browser, simply hold the shift key down while clicking on 
        the desired file. The OpenServer Skunkware distribution is available via 
        http and ftp at either : 
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/osr5/"> http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/osr5</a> 
        <li><a href="ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/osr5/"> ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/osr5</a> 
      </ul>
      <p> After locating a component's download directory (see <a href="#q1">the 
        previous answer</a>), the typical OpenServer Skunkware distribution will 
        contain several files. These include : 
      <dl> 
        <dt>Media images installable with the SCO Software Manager (custom) 
        <dd>This is the file "VOLS.tar", a tar archive of custom installable media 
          images. This is the preferred and recommended downloadable and installable 
          component format. 
        <dt>A gzip'd tar or cpio archive 
        <dd>This file is typically named component-release.tar.gz or component-release.cpio.gz 
          where "component-release" stands for the name and release of the component 
          (e.g. vim-4.6). This is an alternate distribution format which is intended 
          for those people who dislike using the SCO Software Manager (custom) 
          or for components which have not yet been packaged for use with custom. 
          <p> This file contains a binary distribution which can be extracted 
            by hand as the root user from / on the target system. If a VOLS.tar 
            file exists for this component, it is recommended to download that 
            and install using custom. 
        <dt>Source for the component 
        <dd>There should always be a gzip'd tar archive of the source used to 
          build a particular Skunkware component as well as a pointer back to 
          the original source (often they are identical). This source archive 
          is usually stored in the "src" subdirectory of the download directory 
          for a component. For instance, the source to vim is in the directory 
          <a href="ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/osr5/editors/vim/src/"> /skunkware/osr5/editors/vim/src</a>. 
          This directory (and the one at <a href="ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/uw2/editors/vim/src/"> 
          /skunkware/uw2/editors/vim/src</a>) is a symbolic link to the single 
          source directory that contains the source archives for all platforms. 
          For instance, the vim source is actually located at <a href="ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/src/editors/vim/"> 
          /skunkware/src/editors/vim</a>) and is linked into the osr5 and uw2 
          trees.

      <p> <b><a name="q3">How do I download "xyz" for SCO UnixWare?</a></b> 
      <p> Make sure to download files in binary mode when using ftp. To download 
        with your web browser, simply hold the shift key down while clicking on 
        the desired file. The UnixWare Skunkware distribution is available via 
        http and ftp at either :

      </ul>
      In addition, there is a Skunkware distribution intended specifically for 
      the SVR5 based UnixWare 7. This distribution can be accessed via either 
      http or ftp at : 
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/uw7/"> http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/uw7</a>

        <dt>A "package" file installable with the pkgadd facility on UnixWare 
        <dd>This is the file "component.pkg", where "component" stands for the 
          name of the Skunkware component (e.g. vim.pkg). This is the preferred 
          and recommended downloadable and installable component format.

        ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/osr5/shellutil/gzip/gzip-1.2.4-VOLS.tar</a> 
      <p> These are custom installable media images. To install, extract the tar 
        archive into an empty directory somewhere (say /tmp/gzip) and run 
      <pre>
    # custom -p SKUNK98:GZIP -i -z /tmp/gzip

      <p> This is a pkgadd installable data stream. Install by running 
      <pre>

        or <br>
        <a href="ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/uw2/shellutil/gzip/gzip.pkg"> ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/uw2/shellutil/gzip/gzip.pkg</a>

      <p> <b><a name="q5b">What now? Where is the application I just installed?</a></b> 
      <p> Basically, we've tried to confine the Skunkware applications and their 
        associated data files, libraries, and such to /usr/local. The binary executables 
        get put in /usr/local/bin, the man pages in /usr/local/man, the libraries 
        in /usr/local/lib, the header files in /usr/local/include, the info documentation in /usr/local/info and so on (with 
        some exceptions). 
      <p> So, to be able to execute something like, say, gzip, you would either 
        need to : 
      <pre>
    $ /usr/local/bin/gzip ...
</pre>
      or, preferably : 
      <pre>
    $ PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
    $ export PATH
    $ gzip ...
</pre>
      You can add /usr/local/bin to your shell PATH variable by editing your $HOME/.profile 
      (this variable is called path for csh users and can be set in the $HOME/.login). 
      <p> For Bourne and Korn shell users (sh and ksh), add the following lines 
        to your .profile : 
      <pre>
    PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
    export PATH
</pre>
      For C-shell users (csh), add the following to your .login : 
      <pre>
    set path = ($path $home/bin /usr/local/bin .)
</pre>
      You can also add /usr/local/man to your MANPATH variable in a similar manner. 
      <p> After setting up your PATH (and MANPATH) as described above, you can 
        then execute binaries that live in /usr/local/bin by just typing their 
        name (e.g. gzip). If you setup your MANPATH as well, you can read man 
        pages that live in /usr/local/man by simply typing "man command" where 
        "command" is a command like gcc or whatever. 
      <p> <a href="#top"> [top]</a> 
      <p> <b><a name="gcc">Can i use GCC without the SCO Development System?</a></b> 
      <p> The GCC package for OpenServer requires system libraries and headers. 
        Even if you do not have a licensed SCO development system, you are licensed 
        to use these at no cost and they are available on your installation media. 
        Install them thusly: 
      <ul>
        <li> Invoke custom 
        <li> Select "Install New" option from the "Software" menu. 
        <li> Follow the prompts to steer custom toward the original media you 
          used to install OpenServer 5. 
        <li> Select Application Development Libraries and Linker. Install it all. 
          This will give you the libraries, headers, and man pages.

      <p> <b><a name="q5d">Is Skunkware Y2K compliant?</a></b> 
      <p> The SCO Skunkware components are officially unsupported. As such, there 
        is no SCO Y2K warranty on any of the Skunkware components. This is changing 
        as some of these packages move from Skunkware into the standard product. 
      <p> Any Y2K compliance statements for Skunkware components would be issued 
        by the maintainers of that package. For instance, see <a href=http://www.apache.org/foundation/Y2K.html> 
        http://www.apache.org/foundation/Y2K.html</a> for a statement on the Apache 
        web server Y2K compliance. 
      <p> You will have to do something like this with each of the Skunkware components 
        you wish to "warranty" against Y2K compliance. I use the Skunkware web 
        site as a navigational aid in finding the home page of various Skunkware 
        packages. For instance, if you wanted to know about Y2K and Python, you 
        could go to skunkware.dev/skunkware, click on Interpreters, click on Python 
        and go to the Python home page at www.python.org. There, you would find 
        a typical Y2K statement along the lines of "There are no known Y2K problems 
        ... We think Pyton is Y2K compliant ... If there's a problem, we will 
        fix it". 
      <p> We've found the Open Source developer community quite adept at identifying 
        and fixing problems rapidly. This model functions well only with an active 
        participatory user community. If you find a Y2K problem with any Skunkware 
        component, please e-mail an in-depth description of that problem to skunkware@ronrecord.com 
        and we will work with the package maintainers to remedy the problem as 
        soon as possible.

      <p> <b><a name="q10">Can I charge money for SCO Skunkware?</a></b> 
      <p> The answer depends on the license terms of the Skunkware components. 
        The owners of some components do not permit commercial resale, so you 
        cannot charge for copying those components, and therefore you cannot sell 
        or resell the Skunkware CD. 
      <p> However, most components, including all components licensed under the

      <p> <b> <a name="q12c">Are the free Open Sound System audio drivers crippled?</a></b> 
      <p> The reason 4Front is still charging $40 for copies of the driver is 
        that they are selling the non-SoundBlaster drivers. SCO only licensed 
        the drivers for true SB and 100%-compatible cards. 
      <p> Note that there are some cards that call themselves "SoundBlaster compatible" 
        but aren't. These cards have an 8-bit SB-lookalike mode, but it takes 
        special instructions to put the card in SB compatability mode. These cards 
        are not supported by the drivers SCO licensed, but are supported by other 
        drivers from 4Front. 
      <p> Also, some of the more advanced SB cards (like the AWE64) come with 
        an Emu8000 synthesis chip. These also require a special driver from 4Front. 
      <p> The drivers that SCO licensed for inclusion in the OS (and that were 
        on Skunkware) will do the following: 
      <ul>
        <li> DSP synthesis and sampling at 8 or 16 bit depths (used for playing 
          and recording .wav, .au, .mp3, etc.) 
        <li> OPL3 MIDI synthesis (used when the card generates its "own" wave 
          forms). This is replaced with the Emu chip on the more expensive SB 
          cards. 
        <li> MIDI signal generation (through the joystick port, to drive external 
          synthesizers) 
        <li> Mixer control (for changing relative levels of various devices, recording 
          source, balance, equalization, etc.) 
        <li> Activation of Plug & Play devices. I won't go into exactly how PnP 
          works, but an unactivated card is unusable by the system, and an activated 
          card looks just like a generic (non-PnP) SB card. The activation can 
          be carried out either by a driver or by the Plug & Play BIOS (if present 
          on the motherboard). 
      </ul>
      Each of the above bullets corresponds to a separate driver. (If you have 
      an OSR5 system with the 4Front drivers from Skunkware installed, you can 
      look in /usr/lib/oss/modules and see the individual drivers.) 
      <p> Anyway, there's no such thing as a driver that's crippled so that "PnP 
        cards don't work". Even with the old Voxware drivers, you can use a PnP 
        sound card if you have a Plug & Play BIOS to activate the card.
