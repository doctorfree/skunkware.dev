This directory contains the source hierarchies used to build the
principle components of the Non-Stop Open Source E-Commerce Pack.
The file scripts-1.0.tar.gz contains the various scripts used in
packaging and enhancing several components for deployment on a
Non-Stop Cluster (e.g. init.d, keepalive.d and spawndaemon.d scripts).

Many of these Open Source development projects provide anonymous
CVS access to their on-going development trees. See the individual
component web sites for further details on obtaining access to the
latest development snapshots. A useful tool for monitoring anonymous
CVS repositories is available via:

    http://www.sco.com/skunkware/src/devtools/cvsget.gz

You may also wish to download and install additional Open Source
components pre-built and pre-packaged for use on UnixWare 7. See:

    http://www.sco.com/skunkware/

Source code for the several supporting Open Source packages contained
in this release (e.g. gzip, GNU fileutils, GNU shell utils, GNU dbm, ...)
is available via either:

    http://www.sco.com/skunkware/src/
or
    ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/src/
