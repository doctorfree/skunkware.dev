<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> number of 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTML</FONT> pages are special for MiniVend operation. Typically they are used to transmit error messages, status of search or order operations, and other out of boundary conditions.


<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> The distributed demo does not use all of the default values.

<P>
The names of these pages can be set with the <EM>SpecialPage</EM>
directive. The standard pages and their default locations:

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_canceled">canceled (special_pages/canceled.html)</A></STRONG><DD>
The page displayed by MiniVend when an order has been canceled by the user.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_catalog">catalog (special_pages/catalog.html)</A></STRONG><DD>
The main catalog page presented by MiniVend when another page is not
specified.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_failed">failed (special_pages/failed.html)</A></STRONG><DD>
If the sendmail program could not be invoked to email the completed order,
the failed.html page is displayed. (Sadly we don't know if the email was
successfully delivered).

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_flypage">flypage (special_pages/flypage.html)</A></STRONG><DD>
If the catalog page for an item was not found when its <CODE>[item-link]</CODE>
is clicked, this page is used as a template to build an on-the-fly page.
See <EM>On-the-fly Catalog Pages</EM>.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_interact">interact (special_pages/interact.html)</A></STRONG><DD>
Displayed if an unexpected response was received from the browser, such as
not getting expected fields from submitting a form. This would probably
happen from typos in the html pages, but could be a browser bug.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_missing">missing (special_pages/missing.html)</A></STRONG><DD>
This page is displayed if the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>URL</FONT> from the browser specifies a page that does not
have a matching .html file in the pages directory. This can happen if the
customer saved a bookmark to a page that was later removed from the
database, for example, or if there is a defect in the code. 

<P>
Essentially this is the same as a 404 error in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTTP.</FONT> If you want to actually display a 404 error,
just put this in special_pages/missing.html:

<P>
<PRE>    [tag op=header]Status: 404 missing[/tag]
</PRE>
</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_nomatch">nomatch (special_pages/nomatch.html)</A></STRONG><DD>
This page is displayed if the search engine is used, but there is no match
for the search specification and no <A HREF="#item__no_match_">[no-match]</A>
region found on the search page.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_noproduct">noproduct (special_pages/noproduct.html)</A></STRONG><DD>
This page is displayed if the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>URL</FONT> from the browser specifies the ordering of a
product code which is not in the products file.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_order">order (special_pages/order.html)</A></STRONG><DD>
This page is displayed when the customer orders an item. It can contain any
or all of the customer-entered values, but is commonly used as a status
display (or ``shopping basket'').

<P>
It is normal to set this page to something in your user page space:

<P>
<PRE>    SpecialPage   order   ord/basket
</PRE>
</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_search">search (special_pages/search.html)</A></STRONG><DD>
Contains the default output page for the search engine results. Also
required is an input page, which can be the same as search.html or an
additional page.

<P>
By convention MiniVend defines this as the page <CODE>results</CODE>.

<P>
<PRE>    SpecialPage   search   results
</PRE>
</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_violation">violation (pages/violation.html)</A></STRONG><DD>
Displayed if a security violation is noted, such as an attempt to access a
page denied by an <CODE>access_gate</CODE>. See <EM>UserDB</EM>.
