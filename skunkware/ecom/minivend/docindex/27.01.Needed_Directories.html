<P>
The MiniVend program, and its supporting libraries, should all go into one
directory as installed by the installation program.

<P>
User catalog pages, user databases, and user configuration files should all go into their private directories. Because the catalog pages are served through the MiniVend cgi-bin program and contain nonstandard elements, they should not be put into a public 
<FONT SIZE=-1>WWW</FONT> directory, nor do they need to have world-readable file permissions.


<P>
<STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE</STRONG>: Since catalogs are all run under one server, permissions are complex and
very important. Please let the MiniVend configuration program do the work!

<P>
You will want a public 
<FONT SIZE=-1>WWW</FONT> directory for in-line image graphic files. MiniVend does not serve the images, only the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTML</FONT> tags calling them. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> useful convention is to place all buttonbars, backgrounds, and icons in the /images directory, with the catalog items perhaps located in the /images/catalog directory. It is up to you, but remember that you must use an
 <EM>absolute path</EM> -- relative paths will not do. MiniVend 2.0 supports the <EM>ImageDir</EM> directive, which places that as the absolute path in front of all relative 
<FONT SIZE=-1>IMG</FONT> and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>INPUT</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SRC</FONT> specifications.


<P>
You will need a cgi-bin directory in which to put the vlink or tlink
program.
