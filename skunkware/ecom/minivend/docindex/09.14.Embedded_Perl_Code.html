<P>
Perl code can be directly embedded in MiniVend pages. The code is specified
as:

<P>
<PRE>    [perl]
        $name    = $Values-&gt;{name};
        $browser = $Session-&gt;{browser};
        return &quot;Hi, $name! How do you like your $browser?&quot;;
    [/perl]
</PRE>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>ASP</FONT> syntax can be used with:

<P>
<PRE>    [mvasp]
        &lt;%
        $name    = $Values-&gt;{name};
        $browser = $Session-&gt;{browser};
        %&gt;
        Hi, &lt;%= $name %&gt;!
        &lt;%
            HTML &quot;How do you like your $browser?&quot;;
        %&gt;
    [/perl]
</PRE>
<P>
The two snippets above are essentially equivalent.

<P>
The <CODE>[perl]</CODE> tag enforces <EM>Safe.pm</EM> checking, and many standard Perl operators are not available. This is a <CODE>good</CODE> thing, as you would not want users having access to all files and programs
on the system with the MiniVend daemon's permissions! See <EM>GlobalSub</EM> and <EM>UserTag</EM>
for ways to make external files and programs available to MiniVend.

<P>
named attributes:

<P>
<PRE>    [perl tables=&quot;tables-to-open&quot;* subs=1 global=1* no_return=1*]
</PRE>
<P>
Required attributes: none

<P>
Attribute information:

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_global">global</A></STRONG><DD>
When set to <CODE>1</CODE>, and when the catalog is allowed to use global permissions via the <CODE>minivend.cfg</CODE> directive <CODE>AllowGlobal</CODE>, Safe.pm checking is turned off. In this case, the embedded Perl code can do anything that the user 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ID</FONT> running it can! This is not recommended when the same MiniVend server runs for different companies/user ids. Be careful! Security is your responsiblity and should be your concern.


</DD><P><DT><STRONG>subs</STRONG><DD>
When set to <CODE>1</CODE>, any <CODE>GlobalSub</CODE> routines can be accessed by name.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_tables">tables</A></STRONG><DD>
Opens specified MiniVend database tables, preparing them for access inside
the Perl code. 

<P>
When running under <CODE>Safe</CODE>, some database operations are restricted due to inability to create objects. For 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SQL</FONT> there is nothing that can be done -- you must have
 <A HREF="#item_global">global</A> access to use data from 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SQL</FONT> tables. But for MiniVend databases, you can access
them as long as you pre-open them by using an item first.

<P>
Example:

<P>
<PRE>    [perl tables=&quot;products pricing&quot;]
        $key = $Values-&gt;{sku};
        $title = $Tag-&gt;data('products', 'title', $key):
        return &quot;You looked up the title $title&quot;;
    [/perl]
</PRE>
<P>
If the tables=products&gt; was not specified, there would be a syntax error
trap from <CODE>Safe.pm</CODE>.

</DD><P></DL>
<P>
Any MiniVend tag (except ones using 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SQL)</FONT> can be accessed via the <CODE>$Tag</CODE> object. If you need to use 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SQL</FONT> queries inside a Perl element, you will have to have
 <CODE>AllowGlobal</CODE> permissions and set the <CODE>global=1</CODE> parameter.

<P>
Examples:

<P>
<PRE>    # If the item might contain a single quote
    [perl]
    $comments = $Value-&gt;{comments};
    [/perl]
</PRE>
<P>
<STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE:</STRONG> Global subroutines are not subject to the stringent security checking of
the <EM>Safe</EM> module, so almost anything goes there. The subroutine will be able to
modify any variable in MiniVend, and will be able to write to read and
write any file that the MiniVend daemon has permission to write. Though
this gives great power, it should be used with caution. Careful! They are
defined in the main minivend.cfg file, so should be safe from individual
users in a multi-catalog system.

<P>
Global subroutines are defined in <EM>minivend.cfg</EM> with the
<EM>GlobalSub</EM> directive, or in user catalogs which have been enabled via <EM>AllowGlobal</EM>. Global subroutines are much faster than the others as they are
pre-compiled. (Faster still are <EM>UserTag</EM>
definitions.)

<P>
Catalog subroutines are defined in <EM>catalog.cfg</EM>, with the <EM>Sub</EM> directive. They are subject to the stringent <EM>Safe.pm</EM>
security restrictions that are controlled by <EM>SafeUntrap</EM>. 

<P>
The code can be as complex as desired, but cannot use any operators that
modify the file system or use ``unsafe'' operations like ``system'',
``exec'', or backticks. These constraints are enforced with the default
permissions of the standard Perl module <EM>Safe</EM> -- operations may be untrapped on a system-wide basis with the <EM>SafeUntrap</EM> directive.

<P>
The result of the tag will be the result of the last expression evaluated,
just as in a subroutine. If there is a syntax error or other problem with
the code, there will be no output.

<P>
Here is a simple one which does the equivalent of the classic hello.pl
program:

<P>
<PRE>    [perl] my $tmp = &quot;Hello, world!&quot;; $tmp; [/perl]
</PRE>
<P>
Of course you wouldn't need to set the variable -- it is just there to show
the capability.

<P>
To echo the user's browser, but within some 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTML</FONT> tags:

<P>
<PRE>    [perl]
    my $html = '&lt;H5&gt;';
    $html .= $Session-&gt;{'browser'};
    $html .= '&lt;/H5&gt;';
    $html;
    [/perl]
</PRE>
<P>
To show the user their name, and the current time:

<P>
<PRE>    [perl arg=values]
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    my $string = &quot;Hi, &quot; . $Values-&gt;{'name'} &quot;. The time is now &quot;;
    $string .= $Tag-&gt;mvtime();
    $string;
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    [/perl]
</PRE>
