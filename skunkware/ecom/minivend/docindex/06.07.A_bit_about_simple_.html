<P>
The <A HREF="#item_simple">simple</A> catalog really isn't. It is a fairly full-featured demonstration of
MiniVend capabilities, though not nearly all of its features are used
there.

<P>
It uses the <CODE>Variable</CODE> feature extensively to simplify hand page editing. Basically speaking, a <CODE>Variable</CODE> is a <EM>define</EM> that allows you to substitute text for a simple 
<FONT SIZE=-1>__VARIABLE__</FONT> string in your page.

<P>
For example, in the simple demo, this is a complete page with the standard
layout:

<P>
<PRE>    __LOGOBAR__
    __MENUBAR__
    __LEFTSIDE__
 
        This is your content.
 
    __RIGHTSIDE__
    __MENUBOTTOM__
    __COPYRIGHT__
</PRE>
<P>
The way this looks on the page, roughly, is:

<P>
<PRE>    +--------------------------------------------------------+
    |   __LOGOBAR__                                          |
    |--------------------------------------------------------+
    |   __MENUBAR__                                          |
    |--------------+-------------------------+---------------+
    |              |                         |               |
    | __LEFTSIDE__ |   This is your content  | __RIGHTSIDE__ |
    |              |                         |               |
    |              |                         |               |
    +--------------+-------------------------+---------------+
    |   __MENUBOTTOM__                                       |
    |--------------------------------------------------------+
    |   __COPYRIGHT__                                        |
    +--------------------------------------------------------+
</PRE>
<P>
The 
<FONT SIZE=-1>__RIGHTSIDE__</FONT> is simply defined to be empty, closing table 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTML</FONT> in most cases, so it really is this in most pages:


<P>
<PRE>    +--------------------------------------------------------+
    |   __LOGOBAR__                                          |
    |--------------------------------------------------------+
    |   __MENUBAR__                                          |
    |--------------+-----------------------------------------+
    |              |                                         |
    | __LEFTSIDE__ |   This is your content                  |

<P>
The variables are defined in <CODE>catalog.cfg</CODE>, and come from files in the config directory. There are conditional
templates with some different color schemes.

<P>
Once you get used to using this method, it can be quite convenient. But you may certainly choose to use your own method, perhaps one based on an 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTML</FONT> editor. MiniVend can coexist with some editors; ones that have a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>&lt;NOTOUCH&gt;</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>&lt;/NOTOUCH&gt;</FONT> or 
<FONT SIZE=-1>&lt;NOEDIT&gt;</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>&lt;/NOEDIT&gt;</FONT> pair to define areas that should not be ``masterminded'' by the editor are best.


<P>
Bear in mind that this templating method and database layout of the simple
catalog is a loose suggestion on how your catalog might be organized. Many
users decide to do their own database structure for product display. What
you can do is more limited by your imagination than anything.

<P>
Yet most users stick with the userdb and checkout strategies employed in
the catalog. This is because they have been developed over a period of
years and work. Still, these can be customized; you can make it operate
like Amazon or another site if you wish.

<P>
As stated before, MiniVend catalogs are all about the database. The
<A HREF="#item_simple">simple</A> demo has several tables:

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_area">area</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> table designed to implement a dynamic navigation
bar. It is read and parsed to display the areas <CODE>Galleries</CODE>, <CODE>Other Stuff</CODE>, and <CODE>Links</CODE>
as distributed. Simply by changing the contents of the <A HREF="#item_area">area</A> table you can change the left side navigation bar. The value of the field
<A HREF="#item_selector">selector</A> is used to search the <A HREF="#item_cat">cat</A> table to find which categories belong in each area.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_cat">cat</A></STRONG><DD>
The product structure of simple follows a single-level categorization.
Categories are listed in the <A HREF="#item_cat">cat</A> database table. The <A HREF="#item_cat">cat</A> table is designed to allow you to display meta-information about each
category when it is displayed. The fields are:

<DL>
</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_code">code</A></STRONG><DD>
The category code. Must be unique.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG>area</STRONG><DD>
The area this category should be displayed in.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_selector">selector</A></STRONG><DD>
The selector that is used to scan the <A HREF="#item_products">products</A> table for products in the category.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_name">name</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> label to display, so that you don't have to live
with the <A HREF="#item_code">code</A> or <A HREF="#item_selector">selector</A>.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_banner_text">banner_text</A></STRONG><DD>
Text to display in a banner or heading.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_subs">subs</A></STRONG><DD>
Placeholder in the demo; intended to allow selection of certain
subcategories within the category.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_sort">sort</A></STRONG><DD>
The sort order if you don't want alphanumeric on <A HREF="#item_name">name</A>.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_url">url</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>URL</FONT> to link to instead of the default search in the products database.


</DD><P></DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_country">country</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> list of countries; used to build select boxes and
select shipping modes based on countries.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_inventory">inventory</A></STRONG><DD>
Two fields; code and quantity. Minivend's demo will decrement the quantity
based on the sale. That is easy; your method of keeping inventory current
is the hard part. It might make sense to add a field with the usual
shipping time of the product; something like ``ships within 24 hours'', or
``back ordered; allow 2-4 weeks for delivery''.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_pricing">pricing</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> database that works in conjunction with the <CODE>CommonAdjust</CODE> directive to allow quantity pricing, either for one product or for a group
of products (sometimes known as mix-and-match). The fields <CODE>q2,q5,q10,etc.</CODE> are for the quantity levels; the <CODE>price_group</CODE> field selects the mix-and-match category for the product.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG>products</STRONG><DD>
The main product table. This is where you store your product information.
You can add, delete, or ignore fields as you choose. Field by field:

<DL>
</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_sku">sku</A></STRONG><DD>
The unique identifier for the product. Though theoretically it can contain
most any character, you should use only characters of the class 
<CODE>A-Z a-z 0-9 _ -</CODE> if you want to be easily compatible with 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SQL</FONT> databases and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>URL</FONT> encoding. Other characters can cause problems; a slash (
<CODE>/</CODE>) can interfere with URLs and filenames; a colon (<CODE>:</CODE>) can interfere with database representations (or file names on some
operating systems); and there are other possible compatibility situations
with other characters.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_description">description</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> <STRONG>short</STRONG> description for the product, used for displaying in the shopping cart,
receipt, and order report. Keep it short.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_title">title</A></STRONG><DD>
This is somewhat catalog-specific since it applies to art. However, it
would also apply to books, CDs, or other items.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_artist">artist</A></STRONG><DD>
This is somewhat catalog-specific since it applies to art. However, it
would also apply to CDs, or some other items. You can change it to anything
if you remember to change the field names in your catalog pages to match;
to do so look for all occurences of the string ``artist'' in the <A HREF="#item_pages">pages</A>, <CODE>special_pages</CODE>, and <A HREF="#item_etc">etc</A> directories.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_comment">comment</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> long description of the product. If you use the
Minivend internal database, the field size is unlimited; if you use another
type of database then you will be dependent on the field type you select. 

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_display">display</A></STRONG><DD>
Catalog-specific to show the museum the art work is displayed at. You can
use or delete this field as you wish.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG>image</STRONG><DD>
The image filename for the product. Many people add a <CODE>thumb</CODE> field to contain the name of a small image for search list display.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_price">price</A></STRONG><DD>
The quantity-one price of the product.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG>category</STRONG><DD>
The category used for selection in lists. It is possible to place a product
in more than one category, though you will have some display and banner
heading decisions to make based upon this. You can use embedded Perl or
other methods to deal with this.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG>nontaxable</STRONG><DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE>, the product is not taxable and its price will not be used in a salestax
calculation.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG>weight</STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> numeric value of the weight, used for determining
shipping costs. Normally in pounds, but can be anything your shipping
routines will handle.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG>size</STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> comma-separated list of options as used in <CODE>Accessories</CODE>. See the 
<CODE>flypage.html</CODE> and <CODE>ord/basket.html</CODE> pages for examples of how it is used.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_color">color</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> comma-separated list of options as used in <CODE>Accessories</CODE>. See the 
<CODE>flypage.html</CODE> and <CODE>ord/basket.html</CODE> pages for examples of how it is used.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG>related</STRONG><DD>
Used in the demo to display ``upsells'', meaning opportunities to purchase
an additional item when you purchase this one. Contains a list of SKUs to
be offered.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_featured">featured</A></STRONG><DD>
As used in this demo, the only value that means anything is <CODE>front</CODE>. If that is contained in the field, this product will possibly be featured
on the front page via random selection. See the <CODE>index.html</CODE> page for how it integrates with <CODE>[loop search=something random=3]</CODE>.

</DD><P></DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_orderline">orderline</A></STRONG><DD>
Every line item that is actually ordered is detailed in this table. See the
page <CODE>query/check_orders.html</CODE> for how it might be used; see <CODE>etc/report</CODE>
for how it is added to.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_transactions">transactions</A></STRONG><DD>
Each individual customer order is detailed in this table. See the page <CODE>query/check_orders.html</CODE> for how it might be used; see <CODE>etc/report</CODE>
for how it is added to.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_userdb">userdb</A></STRONG><DD>
The user database used for maintaining customer address information,
account information, preferences, and more. See <CODE>UserDB</CODE>.
