<P>
MiniVend can and usually does run multiple catalogs on the same server. If
no <EM>Catalog</EM> directives are present in the main
<EM>minivend.cfg</EM> file, the server will read only a single catalog's information from the one <EM>minivend.cfg</EM> file, just as in early versions of the program.

<P>
You normally call configuration directives with the directive as the first
word on the line, with it's value or values following. Leading whitespace
is stripped from the value.

<P>
You may call additional files with a rudimentary <EM>#include file</EM>
statement. The directives called with includes are always appended at the
end of the main configuration file. Though order is rarely important in the
configuration files, you must define any directory settings in the main
configuration file near the top if they are to be used to base the file
calls of subsequent directives. Files are relative to the catalog directory
(or MiniVend software directory, if in the main minivend.cfg file).

<P>
You can also use a type of ``here document'' to specify MiniVend directives, with the usual 
<FONT SIZE=-1>&lt;&lt;MARKER</FONT> syntax. No semicolon is used to terminate the marker.
