<P>
As of MiniVend 3.11, a flexible chained pricing scheme is available when
the <EM>CommonAdjust</EM> directive is set.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>NOTE:</FONT> For compatibility with older carts, if both
PriceAdjustment and CommonAdjust are set, and CommonAdjust contains a valid
database identifier, the CommonAdjust value is used to set pricing
adjustments based on item attributes. This is not discussed further in this
section; all items below assume <EM>PriceAdjustment</EM> is not in use.

<P>
We talk below about a <EM>CommonAdjust string</EM>; it will be defined in due time.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> few rules about CommonAdjust, all assuming the <EM>PriceField</EM> directive is set to <A HREF="#item_price">price</A>:

<OL>
<LI>
<P>
If <CODE>CommonAdjust</CODE> is set to any value, a valid <EM>CommonAdjust string</EM> or not, extended price adjustments are enabled. It may also hold the
default pricing scheme.

<LI>
<P>
The <A HREF="#item_price">price</A> field may also hold a <EM>CommonAdjust string</EM>. It takes precedence over the default.

<LI>
<P>
If the value of the <CODE>CommonAdjust</CODE> directive is set to a CommonAdjust string, and the <A HREF="#item_price">price</A> field is empty or specifically <EM>0</EM>, then it will be used to set the price of the items.

<LI>
<P>
If PriceBreaks is in use, it's price will take precedence over the value of <CODE>CommonAdjust</CODE>, though it may also contain a CommonAdjust string.

<LI>
<P>
If no CommonAdjust strings are found, then the price will be 0, subject to
any later application of discounts.

<LI>
<P>
If another CommonAdjust string is found as the result of an operation, it
will be re-parsed and the result applied. Chaining is retained; a fallback
may be passed and will take effect.

</OL>
<P>
Prices may be adjusted in several ways, and the individual actions are
referred to below as <EM>atoms</EM>. Price atoms they may be <EM>final</EM>,
<EM>chained</EM>, or <EM>fallback</EM>. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> final price atom is always applied if it does not evaluate to zero. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> chained price atom is subject to further adjustment. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> fallback price atom is skipped if a previous chained price was not zero.


<P>
Atoms are separated by whitespace, and may be quoted (although there should not normally be whitespace in a setting). 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> chained item ends with a comma. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> fallback item has a leading semi-colon. Final atoms have no comma appended or semi-colon prepended.


<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> <EM>settor</EM> is the means by which the price is set. There are There are eight different
types of price settors. All settors can then yield another CommonAdjust
string. 

<P>
It is quite possible to create endless loops, so the maximum number of
initial CommonAdjust strings is set to 16, and there may be only 20
iterations before the price will return zero on an error.

<P>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: Common needs are easily shown but not so easily explained; skip to the
examples if the reference below if your vision starts to blur when reading
the next section. 8-)

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>USAGE:</FONT> Optional items below have asterisks appended.
The asterisk should not be used in the actual string. Optional <STRONG>base</STRONG> or <STRONG>table</STRONG> always defaults to the active <A HREF="#item_products">products</A> database table. The optional <STRONG>key</STRONG>
defaults to the item code except in a special case for the attribute-based
lookup. The <STRONG>field</STRONG> name is not optional except in the case of an attribute lookup.

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_N">N.NN or -N.NN</A></STRONG><DD>
where 
<FONT SIZE=-1>N</FONT> is a digit. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> number which is applied directly; for instance 10 will yield a price of 10. May be a positive or negative number.


</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_N">N.NN%</A></STRONG><DD>
where 
<FONT SIZE=-1>N</FONT> is a digit. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> number which is applied as a percentage of the
 <EM>current</EM> price value. May be a positive or negative number. For example, if the
price is 10 and -8% is applied, the next price value will be 9.20.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_table">table*:column:key*</A></STRONG><DD>
Causes a straight lookup in a database table. The optional <STRONG>table</STRONG> 
defaults to the main products database table for the item (subject of
course to multiple product files). The <STRONG>column</STRONG> must always be present. The optional <STRONG>key</STRONG> defaults to the item code except in a special case for the attribute-based
lookup. The return value is then re-parsed as another price settor.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_table">table*:col1..col5,col10:key*</A></STRONG><DD>
Causes a quantity lookup in database table <STRONG>table</STRONG> (which defaults to the products database), with a set of comma-separated
fields, looked up by the optional <STRONG>key</STRONG>. (Key defaults to the item code, of course). If ranges are specified with
.., each column in the sequence will be used; Therefore

<P>
<PRE>    pricing:p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p10:
</PRE>
<P>
is the same as

<P>
<PRE>    pricing:p1..p5,p10:
</PRE>
<P>
Leading non-digits are stripped, and the item quantity is compared with the
numerical portion of the column name. The price is set to the value of the
database column (numeric portion) that is at least equal to it but doesn't
yet reach the next break.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>WARNING:</FONT> If the field at the appropriate quantity
level is blank, a zero cost will be returned from the atom. It is important
to have all columns populated.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__attribute_table_column_key_">==attribute:table*:column*:key*</A></STRONG><DD>
Does an attribute-based adjustment. The attribute is looked up in the
database <STRONG>table</STRONG>, with the optional <STRONG>column</STRONG> defaulting to the same name as the <EM>value</EM> of the <STRONG>attribute</STRONG>. If the column is not left blank, the <EM>key</EM> is set to the <EM>value</EM> of the <STRONG>attribute</STRONG> if blank.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG>&amp;amp; CODE</STRONG><DD>
The leading <CODE>&amp;</CODE> sign is stripped and the code is passed to the equivalent of a <CODE>[calc]</CODE> tag. No MiniVend tags can be used, but the <CODE>&amp;tag_data</CODE>
routine is available, the current value of the price and quantity are
available as <CODE>$s</CODE>, and the current item (code, quantity, price, and any attributes) are
available as <CODE>$item</CODE>, all forced to the package Vend::Interpolate. That means that in a
UserTag:

<P>
<PRE>  $Vend::Interpolate::item          is the current item
  $Vend::Interpolate::item-&gt;{code}  gives key for current item
  $Vend::Interpolate::item-&gt;{size}  gives size for current item (if there)
  $Vend::Interpolate::item-&gt;{mv_ib} gives database ordered from
</PRE>
</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__valid">[valid minivend tags]</A></STRONG><DD>
If the settor begins with a square bracket (<CODE>[</CODE>) or underscore, it is parsed for MiniVend tags with variable substitution
(but no Locale substitution). You may define a price in a <EM>Variable</EM> in this fashion. The string is re-submitted as an atom, so it may yield yet
another settor.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__">$</A></STRONG><DD>
Tells MiniVend to look in the <CODE>mv_price</CODE> attribute of the shopping cart, and apply that price as the final price, if
it exists. The attribute must be a numerical value.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__word">&gt;&gt;word</A></STRONG><DD>
Tells the routine to return <A HREF="#item_word">word</A> directly as the result. This is not useful in pricing, as it will evaluate
to zero. But when CommonAdjust is used for shipping, it is a way of
re-directing shipping modes.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_word">word</A></STRONG><DD>
The value of <A HREF="#item_word">word</A>, which must not match any of the other settors, is available as a key for
the next lookup (only). If the next settor is a database lookup, and it
contains a dollar sign (<CODE>$</CODE>) the <A HREF="#item_word">word</A>
will be substituted; i.e. <CODE>table:column:$</CODE> becomes <CODE>table:column:word</CODE>.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__">( settor )</A></STRONG><DD>
The value returned by <CODE>settor</CODE> will be used as a key for the next lookup, as above.
