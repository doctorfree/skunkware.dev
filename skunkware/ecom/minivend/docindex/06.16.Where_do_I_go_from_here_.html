MiniVend is very complicated but very powerful. If you have read and
understood the documentation so far, you have a good start on building a
catalog. There are many, many, more features than are shown in the demo,
and mastering the ones you need will take time. Thousands of people have
built MiniVend catalogs -- you can too. If you feel it is beyond you, then
we would suggest engaging a competent consultant. Good luck!
