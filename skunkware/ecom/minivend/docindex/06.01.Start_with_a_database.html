The first thing you must do is develop your product database. This might contain all of the information used to display pages about your products -- or just the product code 
<FONT SIZE=-1>(SKU),</FONT> short description, and price. At the minimum, those three fields are required.


<P>
Some other things you might put in:

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_image">image</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> database field giving the name of an image file to
display the product. Alternatively, you can keep images in files that are
named for the product code -- then display them if they exist (use the
<CODE>[if file file.gif] TAG [/if]</CODE> construct).

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_nontaxable">nontaxable</A></STRONG><DD>
This field should be present if you have items that do not have sales tax
calculated for them.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_size">size</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> comma-separated string containing product size
information, for example:

<P>
<PRE>  Small, Medium, Large, XL
</PRE>
<P>
You can also define any other attribute information in a database field.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_weight">weight</A></STRONG><DD>
The shipping weight of an item is useful for 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UPS</FONT> lookup or other weight-based shipping
calculations.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_category">category</A></STRONG><DD>
If you wish to do one-click category searches to build product directories,
you might use this field to select on.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_related">related</A></STRONG><DD>
Items related to the item in the record. Using MiniVend's <CODE>[loop item]</CODE>
tag, you could build product subclasses and accessory sets.

</DD><P></DL>
<P>
By default, all database source files are located in the in the
<A HREF="#item_products">products</A> subdirectory of the catalog directory. The main products database we
discussed above is in the file <CODE>products/products.txt</CODE>
in the supplied demo catalogs. If you use one of the internal database methods, then any changes that are made to the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ASCII</FONT> source file will be reflected in the database on the next access by a user. If you have a very large database, this may not be what you want -- it can take some time to build a large database. If you have less than a thousand records like the ones shown above in your products database, you normally need not worry -- updates will be almost instantaneous. (See
 <EM>NoImport</EM>
if you wish to stop auto updating.)
