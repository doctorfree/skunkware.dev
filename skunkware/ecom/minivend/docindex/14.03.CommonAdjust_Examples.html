Most examples below use an outboard database table named <STRONG>pricing</STRONG>, but any valid table including the <STRONG>products</STRONG> table can be used. We will refer to this <STRONG>pricing</STRONG> table:

<P>
<PRE>  code    common  q1     q5     q10    XL    S      red
  99-102          10     9      8      1     -0.50  0.75
  00-343                               2
  red      0.75
</PRE>
<P>
The simplest case is a straight lookup on an attribute; <EM>size</EM> in this case. 

<P>
<PRE>  10.00, ==size:pricing
</PRE>
<P>
With this value in the <A HREF="#item_price">price</A> field, a base price of 10.00 will be adjusted with the value of the <EM>size</EM> attribute. If size for the item 99-102 is set to <CODE>XL</CODE> then 1.00 will be added for a total price of 11.00; if it is <CODE>S</CODE> then .50 will be subtracted for a total price of 9.50; for any other value
of <EM>size</EM> no further adjustment would be made. 00-343 would be adjusted up 2.00 only
for <EM>XL</EM>.

<P>
<PRE>  10.00, ==size:pricing, ==color:pricing
</PRE>
<P>
This is the same as above, except both size and color are adjusted for. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> color value of red for item code 99-102 would add
0.75 to the price. For 00-343 it would have no effect.

<P>
<PRE>  10.00, ==size:pricing, ==color:pricing:common
</PRE>
<P>
Here price is set based on a common column, keyed by the value of the color
attribute. Any item with a color value of red would have 0.75 added to the
base price.

<P>
<PRE>  pricing:q1,q5,q10:, ;10.00, ==size:pricing, ==color:pricing:common
</PRE>
<P>
Here is a quantity price lookup, with a fallback price setting. If there is
a valid price found at the quantity of 1, 5, or 10, depending on item
quantity, then it will be used. The fallback of 10.00 only applies if no
non-zero/non-blank price was found at the quantity lookup. In either case,
size/color adjustment is applied.

<P>
<PRE>  pricing:q1,q5,q10:, ;10.00 ==size:pricing, ==color:pricing:common
</PRE>
<P>
Removing the comma from the end of the fallback string stops color/size
lookup if it reaches that point. If a quantity price was found, then size
and color are chained.

<P>
<PRE>  pricing:q1,q5,q10:, ;products:list_price, ==size:pricing, ==color:pricing
</PRE>
<P>
The value of the database column <CODE>list_price</CODE> is used as a fallback instead of the fixed 10.00 value. The above value
might be a nice one to use as the default for a typical retail catalog that
has items with colors and sizes.
