<H2><A NAME="makecat_set_up_a_catalog_from">makecat -- set up a catalog from a template</A></H2>
<P>
The supplied <CODE>makecat</CODE> script, which is in the MiniVend program directory
<CODE>bin</CODE>, is designed to set up a catalog based on your server configuration. It interrogates the user for parameters like the directories to use, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>URL</FONT> to base the catalog in, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTTP</FONT> server definitions, and file ownership. It is self-documenting in that it asks verbose questions and gives relevant examples.


<P>
The <CODE>makecat</CODE> script needs a template catalog to operate on. The
<EM>simple</EM> and <EM>basic</EM> demo templates are distributed with MiniVend. You can also look for older
demo catalogs (mostly for ideas) at <CODE>ftp.minivend.com</CODE>.

<P>
<STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE:</STRONG> You only make a catalog once. All further configuration is done by editing
the files within the <EM>catalog directory</EM>.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> catalog template contains an image of a configured
catalog. The best way to see what the makecat program does is to configure
the simple demo and then run a recursive <CODE>diff</CODE> on the template and configured catalog directories:

<P>
<PRE>  diff -r mvend/simple catalogs/simple
</PRE>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>NOTE:</FONT> <CODE>diff</CODE> is usually only available on 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UNIX.</FONT>

<P>
You will see that the files are mostly the same, except that certain macro
strings have been replaced with the answers you gave to the script. For
example, if you answered <CODE>www.mydomain.com</CODE> at the prompt for server name, then you would see this difference in the
catalog.cfg file:

<P>
<PRE>    # template
    Variable SERVER_NAME  __MVC_SERVERNAME__
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    # configured catalog
    Variable SERVER_NAME  www.mydomain.com
</PRE>
<P>
The macro string 
<FONT SIZE=-1>__MVC_SERVERNAME__</FONT> was substituted with the answer to
the question about server name. In the same way, other variables are
substituted, and include (at least):

<P>
<PRE>    MVC_BASEDIR      MVC_IMAGEDIR
    MVC_CATROOT      MVC_IMAGEURL
    MVC_CATUSER      MVC_MAILORDERTO
    MVC_CGIBASE      MVC_MINIVENDGROUP
    MVC_CGIDIR       MVC_MINIVENDUSER
    MVC_CGIURL       MVC_SAMPLEHTML
    MVC_DEMOTYPE     MVC_SAMPLEURL
    MVC_DOCUMENTROOT MVC_VENDROOT
    MVC_ENCRYPTOR
</PRE>
<P>
(Not all of these are present in the simple or sample templates, and quite a few more may be defined.) In fact, any environment variable that is set and begins with 
<FONT SIZE=-1>MVC_</FONT> will be substituted for by the
 <CODE>makecat</CODE>
script. So if you wanted to set up a configurable parameter to customize the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>COMPANY</FONT> variable in catalog.cfg, you could run a pre-qualifying script that set the environment variable 
<FONT SIZE=-1>MVC_COMPANY</FONT> and then place in the catalog.cfg file:


<P>
<PRE>    Variable   COMPANY   __MVC_COMPANY__
</PRE>
<P>
All files within a template directory are substituted for macros, not just
the catalog.cfg file. There are two special directories named <CODE>html</CODE> and <CODE>images</CODE>. These will be recursively copied to the directories defined as SampleHTML
and ImageDir.

<P>
<STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE:</STRONG> The template directory is located in the MiniVend software directory, i.e.
where <CODE>minivend.cfg</CODE> resides. You normally do not edit files in the template directory. If you
want to try creating your own template, it is recommended that you name it
something besides simple and copy the <A HREF="#item_simple">simple</A> demo directory to it as a starting point. Templates are normally placed in
the MiniVend base directory, but can be located anywhere -- the script will
prompt you for location if it cannot find a template.

<P>
In addition to the standard parameters prompted for by MiniVend, and the
standard catalog creation procedure, you may define four other files in the <A HREF="#item_config">config</A> directory of the template:

<P>
<PRE>    additional_fields  -- file with more parameters for macro substitution
    additional_help    -- extended description for the additional_fields
    precopy_commands   -- commands passed to the system prior to catalog copy
    postcopy_commands  -- commands passed to the system after catalog copy
</PRE>
<P>
All files are paragraph-based; in other words, a blank line (with no
spaces) terminates the individual setting.

<P>
The <EM>additional_fields</EM> file contains:

<P>
<PRE>    PARAM
    The prompt. Set PARAM to?
    The default value of PARAM
</PRE>
<P>
This would cause a question during makecat:

<P>
<PRE>    The prompt. Set PARAM to?.....[The default value of PARAM]
</PRE>
<P>
If the <EM>additional_help</EM> file is present, you can give additional instructions for 
<FONT SIZE=-1>PARAM.</FONT>

<P>
<PRE>    PARAM
    These are additional instructions for PARAM, and they
    may span multiple lines up to the first blank line.
</PRE>
<P>
The prompt would now be:

<P>
<PRE>    These are additional instructions for PARAM, and they
    may span multiple lines up to the first blank line.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    The prompt. Set PARAM to?.....[The default value of PARAM]
</PRE>
<P>
If the file <EM>config/precopy_commands</EM> exists, it will be read as a command followed by the prompt/help value.

<P>
<PRE>    mysqladmin create __MVC_CATALOGNAME__
    We need to create an SQL database for your Minivend
    database tables.
</PRE>
<P>
This will cause the prompt:

<P>
<PRE>    We need to create an SQL database for your Minivend
    database tables.
     
    Run command &quot;mysqladmin create simple&quot;?
</PRE>
<P>
If the response is ``y'' or ``yes'', then the command will be run by passing it through the Perl <CODE>system()</CODE> function. As with any of the additional configuration files, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>MVC_PARAM</FONT> macro substitution is done on the command and help. Obviously you must have proper permissions for the command.


<P>
The file <EM>config/postcopy_commands</EM> is exactly the same as <EM>precopy_commands</EM>
except you are prompted <EM>after</EM> the catalog files are copied and macro substitution is performed on all
files.

<P>
