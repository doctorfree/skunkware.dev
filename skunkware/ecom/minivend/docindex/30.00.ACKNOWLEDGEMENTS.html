First, to Andrew Wilcox for his 1995 Vend, which inspired MiniVend. There
are still a few vestiges of his code in MiniVend, and it would not have
happened without it and him. Thanks, Andrew.

<P>
My wife Jean has shown immense patience with me, especially when 
<FONT SIZE=-1>I</FONT> go into my cave to do a new release. 8-)

<P>
There have been many who contributed to Minivend's development, especially
with testing and feature content. They include:
