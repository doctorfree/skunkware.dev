<P>
MiniVend is normally free of charge, and is distributed under the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>GNU</FONT> general public license. This means that
individuals and organizations, both commercial and non-commercial, may use
MiniVend without charge. If you modify and redistribute it, there are
certain obligations you must fulfill. See the file <STRONG>Copying</STRONG> which came with your MiniVend distribution for the full license.

<P>
MiniVend is not guaranteed to be supported other than by making full source
code available. If it breaks you get to keep both pieces. However, the
author is always looking to improve MiniVend and sometimes answers
questions. The more concise and better-researched your question, the more
likely it is to get an answer. No tutorials will be provided, though. You
have to learn all of this stuff on your own, or use the MiniVend mail list
and hope that someone will help you.
