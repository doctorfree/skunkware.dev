<P>
Obtain, decompress and untar the distribution:

<P>
<PRE>    gzip -dc minivend-4.xx.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</PRE>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>NOTE</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FOR</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>WINDOWS:</FONT> Windows users need to unzip the file WinZip or a similar program or obtain the self-extracting executable.


<P>
Before installing, check the site where you obtained MiniVend for any
patches that might have been issued since the release.

<P>
Change to the created directory, something like:

<P>
<PRE>    cd minivend-4.xx
</PRE>
<P>
On 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UNIX,</FONT> you perform the normal Perl installation method:

<P>
<PRE>    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test &amp;&amp; make install
</PRE>
<P>
Replace the <CODE>perl</CODE> with the proper path to your Perl 5.005 or higher binary.

<P>
You will be asked for the directory where you want to install MiniVend --
any directory will do. The defaults are:

<P>
<PRE>    Installed as root: /usr/local/minivend
    Installed as user: ~/mvend
</PRE>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>NOTE:</FONT> ~ is shorthand for your home directory.

<P>
You must of course have write permission there. This directory is referred
to later in the documentation as <STRONG>VendRoot</STRONG>
or the <STRONG>MiniVend software directory</STRONG>.

<P>
To install the link program, you will eventually need to have write permission on your 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI</FONT> and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTML</FONT> directories. The definition of these are typically part of your 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTTP</FONT> server configuration; In Apache, the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI</FONT> directory is set by
 <STRONG>ScriptAlias</STRONG>; the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTML</FONT> directory is set by <STRONG>DocumentRoot</STRONG>.

<P>
The process should be self-explanatory. If you have trouble answering the
questions asked, <STRONG>look closely</STRONG> at the examples provided. If you still have trouble, you will need to find a tutorial about the World Wide Web -- the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>WWW</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FAQ</FONT> at www.boutell.com would be a good place to look.


<P>
If you discover any problems, refer to the section <EM>If something goes wrong</EM>. Otherwise, MiniVend should be installed at the completion of the script.
It is strongly suggested that you install the demo catalogs as a starting
point for your own catalog -- in fact you will not be able to do anything
useful with MiniVend until you have created a catalog.

<P>
You will want separate directories to hold the catalog pages and databases.
The <CODE>makecat</CODE> program supplied with MiniVend will make those for you.

<P>
<STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE:</STRONG> One point that is to be emphasized --
<EM>only your base html pages go in the document space of your http server.</EM>
Any pages with MiniVend elements/tags go in the directory set by the
<EM>PageDir</EM> directive (the default is <CODE>~/catalogs/catalog_name/pages</CODE>). For the demos supplied with MiniVend, this means that only one or a few pages will be copied to your 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTML</FONT> directory, with the remainder of the pages staying in the directory defined as
 <EM>PageDir</EM>.

<P>
If you are on an 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ISP</FONT> where <STRONG>all</STRONG> of your files are in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTML</FONT> document space, you should disable all access to your MiniVend catalog directory with the proper 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTTP</FONT> access restrictions. Normally that is creating a .htaccess file like this:


<P>
<PRE>  &lt;Limit GET POST&gt;
  order allow,deny
  deny from all
  &lt;/Limit&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
If you are unable to do this, it is recommended that you do not run MiniVend. If you can set file permissions such that files will not be served, it may be 
<FONT SIZE=-1>OK,</FONT> but security will be a problem. Please be careful with your customers' personal information.
