MiniVend is a database access and retrieval system focused on e-commerce.
It allows customers to select items to buy from catalog pages. The program
tracks which products they have selected and the quantity desired. Many
different catalog pages may be visited, and the user ``session'' will be
tracked to build a cumulative list of items. Once selection is finished,
they may complete the ordering process by entering their name and address
along with payment information, if any. Once the order process is
completed, MiniVend submits the order to the system via email or an
external order entry program.

<P>
Though its name begins with ``Mini'', MiniVend is anything but. It is a
high-end, fully customizable, powerful software system with complete
database functionality. It is suitable for many applications besides
shopping carts, though that is its main bent. For example, you can build a
complete database-oriented content display system using MiniVend.

<P>
MiniVend plugs into a system with an 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SSL</FONT> (Secure Sockets Layer) server, allowing encrypted
transmission of sensitive customer data. This capability makes the entry of
credit card numbers practical and secure. In addition, it supports online
payment systems and encryption; no credit card numbers need be stored on
the system ``en clair''.

<P>
Many different catalogs can be run from the same MiniVend server, allowing an 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ISP</FONT> to serve many different customers from one or just a few MiniVend server processes. As many as 2,000 MiniVend catalogs have been run on one machine from the same server process.


<P>
MiniVend is powerful, and correspondingly complex. It can easily handle
catalogs of a million items or more, with excellent performance. It has
completely flexible page display, search, and order entry capability. If
you only have a few items to catalog, MiniVend is probably overkill for
your needs. But if you are willing to spend some up-front learning time, it
can support your simple catalog with unlimited room to grow. To get a fast
start with a simple catalog, start with the simple demo and customize from
there.
