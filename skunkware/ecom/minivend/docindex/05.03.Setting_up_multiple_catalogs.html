<P>
MiniVend has multiple catalog capability, and therefore breaks the
configuration files into two pieces. One is global (<CODE>minivend.cfg</CODE>) and affects every catalog running under it. The other (<CODE>catalog.cfg</CODE>) is specific to an individual catalog, and has no effect on other
catalogs.

<P>
The global <CODE>minivend.cfg</CODE> file is located in the main MiniVend directory, and has only a few
server-wide configuration parameters. The most important is the <EM>Catalog</EM> directive, which defines the catalogs will be created at server startup.
The <EM>Catalog</EM> directive is often set up by the <CODE>makecat</CODE> program, which can be used to configure a catalog.

<P>
Here is an example <EM>Catalog</EM> directive:

<P>
<PRE> Catalog simple /home/catalogs/simple /cgi-bin/simple /secure-bin/simple
</PRE>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>simple</STRONG><DD>
The <EM>catalog identifier</EM>, used as the name of the catalog on command lines. In the supplied demo
configuration this would be <A HREF="#item_simple">simple</A>. The identifier can contain characters from the set [<STRONG>A-Za-z0-9_</STRONG>].

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__home_catalogs_simple">/home/catalogs/simple</A></STRONG><DD>
The directory where the catalog.cfg file may be found, and usually the
directory where pages and databases are kept.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__cgi_bin_simple">/cgi-bin/simple  /secure-bin/simple</A></STRONG><DD>
The script names which, when containing a MiniVend link program, will cause
that catalog to be called. At least one must be supplied, and the same name
may not be used for more than one catalog unless the <EM>FullURL</EM> directive is specified, in which case the parameter may be specified as
www.yourcompany.com/cgi-bin/simple and www.theirs.com/cgi-bin/simple may
call a different catalog.

</DD><P></DL>
<P>
There may also be <EM>SubCatalog</EM> directives:

<P>
<PRE>  SubCatalog easy simple /home/catalogs/simple /cgi-bin/easy
</PRE>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_easy">easy</A></STRONG><DD>
The name of the subcatalog, which also controls the name of the subcatalog
configuration file -- in this case <CODE>easy.cfg</CODE>.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG>simple</STRONG><DD>
The name of the base configuration, which will be the basis for the
catalog. Parameters in the easy.cfg file that are different will override
those in the catalog.cfg file for the base configuration.

</DD><P></DL>
<P>
The remaining parameters are as in the <EM>Catalog</EM> directive.

<P>
Additional minivend.cfg parameters set up administrative parameters that
are catalog wide -- see <EM>Server Configuration File</EM> for details on each of these.

<P>
Each catalog can be completely independent, with different databases -- or
catalogs can share any or all pages, databases, and session files. This
means that several catalogs can share the same information, allowing
``virtual malls''.
