There are several ways that MiniVend can modify the price of a product
during normal catalog operation. Several of them require that the <EM>pricing.asc</EM>
file be present, and that you define a pricing database. You do that by
placing the following directive in <EM>catalog.cfg</EM>:

<P>
<PRE>  Database  pricing pricing.asc 1
</PRE>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>NOTE:</FONT> PriceAdjustment is slightly deprecated by
CommonAdjust, but will remain in use at least through the end of Version 3
of MiniVend.

<P>
Configurable directives and tags with regard to pricing:

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
Quantity price breaks are configured by means of the <EM>PriceBreaks</EM> and
<EM>MixMatch</EM> directives. They require a field named specifically <A HREF="#item_price">price</A>
in the pricing database. The <STRONG>price</STRONG> field contains a space-separated list of prices that correspond to the
quantity levels defined in the
<EM>PriceBreaks</EM> directive. If quantity is to be applied to all items in the shopping cart
(as opposed to quantity of just that item) then the
<EM>MixMatch</EM> directive should be set to <STRONG>Yes</STRONG>.

<LI>
<P>
Individual line-item prices can be adjusted according to the value of their
attributes. See <EM>PriceAdjustment</EM> and <EM>CommonAdjust</EM>. The pricing database <STRONG>must</STRONG> be defined unless you define the <EM>CommonAdjust</EM>
behavior.

<LI>
<P>
Product discounts for individual products, specific product codes, all
products, or the entire order can be configured with the <A HREF="#item__discount_">[discount ...]</A>
tag. Discounts are applied on a per-user basis -- you can gate the discount
based on membership in a club or other arbitrary means. See
<EM>Product Discounts</EM>.

</UL>
<P>
For example, if you decided to adjust the price of T-shirt part number
99-102 up 1.00 when the size is extra large and down 1.00 when the size is
small, you would have the following directives defined in
&lt;catalog.cfg&gt;:

<P>
<PRE>  Database          pricing pricing.asc 1
  UseModifier       size
  PriceAdjustment   size
</PRE>
<P>
To enable automatic modifier handling, you define a size field in
products.txt:

<P>
<PRE>  code    description   price    size
  99-102  T-Shirt       10.00    S=Small, M=Medium, L=Large*, XL=Extra Large
</PRE>
<P>
You would place the proper tag within your <CODE>[item-list]</CODE> on the shopping-basket or order page:

<P>
<PRE>    [item-accessories size]
</PRE>
<P>
In the pricing.asc database source, you would need:

<P>
<PRE>  code      S       XL
  99-102    -1.00   1.00
</PRE>
<P>
As of MiniVend 3.06, if you want to assign a price based on the option,
precede the number with an equals sign:

<P>
<PRE>  code    S       M       L       XL
  99-102  =9.00   =10     =10     =11
</PRE>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>IMPORTANT</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>NOTE:</FONT> Price adjustments occur 
<FONT SIZE=-1>AFTER</FONT> quantity price breaks, so the above would negate anything set with the
 <EM>PriceBreaks</EM> directive/option.

<P>
Numbers that begin with an equals sign (<CODE>=</CODE>) are used as absolute prices and are <EM>interpolated for MiniVend tags first</EM>, so you can use subroutines to set the price. To facilite coordination
with the subroutine, the session variables <CODE>item_code</CODE> and <CODE>item_quantity</CODE> are set to the code and quantity of the item being evaluated. They would be
accessed in a global subroutine with <CODE>$Vend::Session-</CODE>&gt;<CODE>{item_code}</CODE>
and <CODE>$Vend::Session-</CODE>&gt;<CODE>{item_quantity}</CODE>.

<P>
The pricing information must always come from a database because of
security.
