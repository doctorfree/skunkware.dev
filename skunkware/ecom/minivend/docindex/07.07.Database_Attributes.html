<P>
Especially in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SQL</FONT> databases, there are certain things that can be set with additional database attributes. For text import, the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CONTINUE</FONT> extended database import attribute allows additional control over the format of imported text.


<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>NOTE:</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CONTINUE</FONT> applies to all types except 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CSV.</FONT> (You won't want to use 
<FONT SIZE=-1>NOTES</FONT> unless using type 
<FONT SIZE=-1>LINE.)</FONT>


<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_CONTINUE">CONTINUE</A></STRONG><DD>
One of 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UNIX,</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DITTO,</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>LINE,</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>NONE,</FONT> or 
<FONT SIZE=-1>NOTES.</FONT> The default, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>NONE,</FONT> is to simply split the line/record according to the delimiter, with no possible spanning of records. Setting 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CONTINUE</FONT> to 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UNIX</FONT> appends the next line to the current when it encounters a backslash (
<CODE>\</CODE>) at the end of a record, just like many Unix commands and shells.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>DITTO</FONT> is invoked when the key field is blank -- it
adds the contents of following fields to the one above, separated by a
newline character. This allows additional text to be added to a field
beyond the 255 characters available with most spreadsheets and flat-file
databases.

<P>
Example in catalog.cfg:

<P>
<PRE>  Database products products.txt  TAB
  Database products CONTINUE      DITTO
</PRE>
<P>
Products.asc file:

<P>
<PRE>  code     price     description
  00-0011  500000    The Mona Lisa, one of the worlds great masterpieces.
                     Now at a reduced price!
</PRE>
<P>
The description for product 00-0011 will contain the contents of the
<A HREF="#item_description">description</A> field on both lines, separated by a newline.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>NOTE:</FONT> Fields are separated by tabs, formatted for
reading convenience.

<P>
This <EM>will</EM> work for multiple fields in the same record. If the field contains any
non-empty value, it will be appended.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>LINE</FONT> is a special setting so that you can use a multi-line field. Normally, when using the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>LINE</FONT> type, you may have only data on one line separated by one blank line. When using 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CONTINUE</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>LINE,</FONT> you may have some number of fields which are each on a line, while the last one spans multiple lines up until the first blank line.


<P>
Example in catalog.cfg:

<P>
<PRE>  Database products products.txt  LINE
  Database products CONTINUE      LINE

<P>
<STRONG>NOTES</STRONG> reads a Lotus Notes ``structured text'' file. The format is that there are
any number of fields, all except one of which must have a field name
followed by a colon and then the data. There is optional whitespace after
the colon.

<P>
Records are separated by a settable delimiting charater which goes on a line by itself, much like a ``here document''. By default it is a form feed 
<FONT SIZE=-1>(^L)</FONT> character.


<P>
The final field begins at the first blank line and continues to the end of
the record. This final field is named <CODE>notes_field</CODE>
unless you set it as mentioned below.

<P>
MiniVend reads the field names from the first paragraph of the file. The
key field should be first, followed by other fields in any order. If one
(and only one) field name has whitespace, then its name is used for the <CODE>notes_field</CODE> and any characters after a space or 
<FONT SIZE=-1>TAB</FONT> are used as the record delimiter. If there are none, then the delimiter returns to the default form feed 
<FONT SIZE=-1>(^L)</FONT> and the field name reverts to
 <CODE>notes_field</CODE>. The field in question will be discarded, but a second field with
whitespace will cause an import error.

<P>
Following records are then read by name, and only fields with data in them
need be set. Only the <CODE>notes_field</CODE> may contain a newline. It is always the last field in the record, and
begins at the <STRONG>first</STRONG> blank line.

<P>
The following example sets the delimiter to a tilde <CODE>(~)</CODE> and renames the <CODE>notes_field</CODE> to <A HREF="#item_description">description</A>.

<P>
<PRE>  Database products products.txt  LINE

Microsoft Excel is a widely-used tool to maintain MiniVend databases, but
has several problems with its standard TAB-delimited export, like encasing
fields containing commas in quotes, generating extra carriage returns
embedded in records, and not including trailing blank fields. To avoid
problems, use a text-qualifier of <STRONG>none</STRONG>.

<P>
Set the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>EXCEL</FONT> attribute to 1 to fix these problems on import:

<P>

<P>
This is normally used only with TAB-delimited files.
