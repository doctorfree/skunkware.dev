<P>
Determine how users will enter and exit your catalog. There are quite
complex and intelligent conditional schemes possible, especially if you use
the <EM>Cookies</EM> capability, but simplicity should be the aim. No one can buy from you if
they cannot navigate their way around!

<P>
The most important thing to remember is that if you are supporting browsers
which might not accept cookies, you must never send the user to a page that
is not served by MiniVend. If you do, they will lose their session (and
items in their shopping cart). MiniVend will help in this regard, but you
must use its <A HREF="#item_area">area</A> and <A HREF="#item_page">page</A> tags.

<P>
If you are using frames, you must be careful to source all frame panes
containing MiniVend links from an initial page served by MiniVend. If you
do not, then you may find the user has multiple session IDs depending on
which frame the link came from.
