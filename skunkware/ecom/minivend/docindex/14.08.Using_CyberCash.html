<P>
MiniVend will directly interface with Perl libraries provided by CyberCash,
Inc. This allows direct card billing at the time the order is placed. If
using CyberCash 2, the module is called CCLib.pm and its version should be
1.3 or greater. If the library is found at startup, the message ``CyberCash
2 module found'' will be displayed.

<P>
MiniVend 3.11 and above support CyberCash 3; see the section below for
differences when using CyberCash 3.

<P>
To use CyberCash 2, you must first have a CyberCash Secure Merchant Payment Server 
<FONT SIZE=-1>(SMPS)</FONT> running on your system. It must be fully enabled, and should be tested 
<FONT SIZE=-1>OK</FONT> with the CyberCash test suite. This capability has been tested to work with SMPS-2.1.x in
 <CODE>mauthcapture</CODE> and <CODE>mauthonly</CODE>
modes. Any modes supported by CyberCash should work.

<P>
The special mode <CODE>minivend_test</CODE> will cause the transaction to complete successfully and the information
that would have been sent to the CyberCash server to be logged in the
catalog <CODE>error.log</CODE> file.

<P>
The CyberCash Perl library module must be available to MiniVend -- if you
cannot install it in the main Perl library then the Minivend software
directory <EM>lib/</EM> will suffice. If it is found at MiniVend startup, a message will be
displayed.

<P>
MiniVend only will charge CyberCash in the final phase of the order
process, i.e. at the time the receipt and order report are generated. The
full amount as shown by the <CODE>[total-cost]</CODE> tag will be billed -- if you need to do partial charges you will have to
manage multiple shopping carts.

<P>
The process of enabling CyberCash processing is something like this:

<OL>
<LI>
<P>
Turn off CreditCardAuto by setting the catalog directive to No. This would
normally be done right in catalog.cfg, but it also can be done in a
mv_click subroutine if you wish to mix transaction types:

<P>
<PRE>    &lt;INPUT TYPE=checkbox NAME=mv_click VALUE=CyberCash&gt; Use CyberCash
    [set CyberCash]
        [perl]
            $Config-&gt;{CreditCardAuto} = 0;
            $Config-&gt;{CyberCash} = 1;
            return '';
        [/perl]
    mv_cyber_mode=mauthcapture
    [/set]
</PRE>
<LI>
<P>
Enable the CyberCash directive in catalog.cfg (or with the technique
above). Also set the catalog <EM>Variable</EM> value <STRONG>CYBER_SECRET</STRONG> to the ``secret'' for your payment server. If you are not using the default
values of <STRONG>localhost</STRONG> and <STRONG>8000</STRONG> for your server and port, set the Variables <STRONG>CYBER_HOST</STRONG> and <STRONG>CYBER_PORT</STRONG> as well. In the catalog.cfg file it would look like:

<P>
<PRE>    CreditCardAuto   No
    CyberCash        Yes
    Variable         CYBER_SECRET  first-natl
    Variable         CYBER_PORT    8000
    Variable         CYBER_HOST    localhost
</PRE>
<LI>
<P>
Set your final order screen to accept the user form fields
<A HREF="#item_mv_credit_card_number">mv_credit_card_number</A> (contains the actual card number),
<A HREF="#item_mv_credit_card_exp_month">mv_credit_card_exp_month</A> and <A HREF="#item_mv_credit_card_exp_year">mv_credit_card_exp_year</A> (the expiration date month and year), and the fields containing name,
address, city, state, and country. And <STRONG>you must</STRONG> define the form field <CODE>mv_cyber_mode</CODE>  <STRONG>on the submitting form</STRONG> to enable the processing.

<P>
The order mode must be final, either by omitting an order profile entirely
or by defining an order profile that contains &amp;final=yes.

</OL>
<P>
The fields containing name and address information should be the same as on
the standard MiniVend demo order pages:

<P>
<PRE>    b_name       Billing name      takes priority
    name         Shipping name     used if b_name empty
    b_address    Billing address   takes priority
    address      Shipping address  used if b_address empty
    b_city       Billing city      takes priority
    city         Shipping city     used if b_city empty
    b_state      Billing state     takes priority
    state        Shipping state    used if b_state empty
    b_country    Billing country   takes priority
    country      Shipping country  used if b_country empty
</PRE>
<P>
If you must use other values, they can be redefined in catalog.cfg with the <EM>Variable</EM>  <STRONG>CYBER_REMAP</STRONG> like so:

<P>
<PRE>    Variable CYBER_REMAP  name=my_name address=my_address
</PRE>
<P>
or like so:

<P>
<PRE>    Variable &lt;&lt;EOF
    CYBER_REMAP
    b_name   my_bname
    name     my_name
    address  processed_address
    city     parsed_city
    EOF
</PRE>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> As always when using the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>&lt;&lt;EOF</FONT> (here document) capability, the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>EOF</FONT> must be on a line by itself, with no leading or trailing white space. That includes carriage returns, Windows devotees. Upload in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ASCII</FONT> mode!


<P>
If you have defined the directive <EM>EncryptProgram</EM> to be something containing the value <EM>pgp</EM>, then the <EM>CreditCardAuto</EM> method will be used to encrypt the mv_credit_card_number value before it is
wiped from memory. (Errors in that process will be silently ignored.) It
will never be written to the user session, at least by MiniVend itself, so
attempts to recall it on future forms will be in vain.

<P>
If the authorization fails, the special page <EM>failed</EM> will be displayed, and passed the CyberCash error message for display with
the <CODE>[subject]</CODE> tag. The order will not complete, i.e. the cart will still be intact and no
receipt or order report will be generated. The error itself is always
available as <CODE>[data session cybercash_error]</CODE>.

<P>
If successful, the receipt page will be displayed, the order report
emailed, and the cart will be emptied. If you wish to display the order-id
returned from CyberCash on the receipt, it is available in
<CODE>[data session cybercash_id]</CODE>. If the order is successful, but is detected as a ``success-duplicate'', <CODE>[data session cybercash_error]</CODE>
will contain the message returned from CyberCash.
