<H2><A NAME="The_Vend_Concept">The Vend Concept</A></H2>
<P>
MiniVend is a descendent of Vend, originally developed by Andrew Wilcox in
1995. Though the original Vend was much simpler than MiniVend in
implementation, the basic concept remains unchanged. Quite simply, MiniVend
maintains its own set of pages, <EM>outside of regular HTML space</EM>, which contain special tags that are interpreted by MiniVend.

<P>
The tags, which are in <CODE>[square brackets]</CODE>, are interpreted by MiniVend and many different values can be substituted.
Some examples are:

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_User">User form input</A></STRONG><DD>
MiniVend remembers input by a user from form to form, and the value of any
form variable is ``remembered'' and inserted upon finding a <CODE>[value input_field]</CODE>
tag. The <CODE>input_field</CODE> is a normal 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTML</FONT> form field.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Database">Database contents</A></STRONG><DD>
MiniVend can have an unlimited number of attached databases, either in one of its own internal formats or attached via 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SQL/ODBC.</FONT> The contents of a database can be referenced with tags like
 <CODE>[data table=products column=name key=334-12]</CODE>
or <CODE>[query sql=&quot;select * from products where category = 'Clothing'&quot;]</CODE>.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Session">Session parameters</A></STRONG><DD>
Things like where the user originally found your catalog <CODE>[data session referer]</CODE>), domain they are from (<CODE>[data session host]</CODE>), source of hit in a partner program (<CODE>[data session source]</CODE>), the time of their last access (<CODE>[data session time]</CODE>), and many other parameters.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Embedded">Embedded Perl ala ASP</A></STRONG><DD>
MiniVend has a powerful object system that allows direct access to Perl and
external programs. There is an ASP-like syntax which can be used, or the
traditional MiniVend tag approach can be employed.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_File">File contents or program output</A></STRONG><DD>
You can insert the contents of an outboard file with
<CODE>[file directory/file]</CODE> or <CODE>[include directory/file]</CODE>, or the output from an arbitrary program (given proper permission from
your administrator!).

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Searches">Searches of files</A></STRONG><DD>
MiniVend supports different search engines, including <EM>Glimpse</EM>, or you can make your own 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SQL</FONT> database queries and have MiniVend process the
output for you.

</DD><P></DL>
<P>
There are over 80 different distinct tags supporting hundreds of functions.
In addition, the user can easily implement tags fully as powerful as the
standard tags.
