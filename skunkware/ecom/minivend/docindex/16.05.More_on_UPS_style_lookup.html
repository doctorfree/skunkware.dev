<P>
The UPS-style lookup uses two files for its purposes, both of which need to be in a format like 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UPS</FONT> distributes for 
<FONT SIZE=-1>US</FONT> shippers.


<P>
The <EM>zone file</EM> is a file that is usually specific to the originating location. For 
<FONT SIZE=-1>US</FONT> shippers shipping to 
<FONT SIZE=-1>US</FONT> locations, it is named for the first three digits of the originating zip code with a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CSV</FONT> extenstion -- for example,
 <CODE>450.csv</CODE>.

<P>
It has a format similar to:

<P>
<PRE>    low - high, zone,zone,zone,zone
</PRE>
<P>
The <CODE>low</CODE> entry is the low bound of the geographic location -- <CODE>high</CODE>
is the high bound. (By <EM>geographic location</EM> we mean zip code.) If the first digits of the zip code, compared
alphanumerically, fall between the low and high values, that zone is used
as the column name for a lookup in the <EM>rate database</EM>. The weight is used as the row key.

<P>
The first operative row of the zone file (one without leading quotes) is used to determine the zone column name. In the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>US,</FONT> it looks something like
 

<P>
Dest. ZIP,Ground,3 Day Select,2nd Day Air,2nd Day Air A.M.,Next Day Air
Saver,Next Day Air

<P>
MiniVend strips all non-alpha characters and comes up with:

<P>
DestZIP,Ground,3DaySelect,2ndDayAir,2ndDayAirAM,NextDayAirSaver,NextDayAir

<P>
Therefore, the zone column (shipping type) that you would use use for 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UPS</FONT> ground would be ``Ground'', and that is what the
database should be named. To support the above, you would want a <CODE>shipping.asc</CODE> line that reads:

<P>
<PRE>    upsg  UPS Ground  weight  0  150  u Ground [default zip 983]
</PRE>
<P>
and a <CODE>catalog.cfg</CODE> database callout of:

<P>
<PRE>    Database  Ground  Ground.csv  CSV
</PRE>
<P>
You can change these column names as long as they correspond to the <CODE>identifier</CODE> of your rate database.

<P>
The <EM>rate database</EM> is a standard MiniVend database. For 
<FONT SIZE=-1>US</FONT> shippers, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UPS</FONT> distributes their rates in a fairly standard comma-separated value format, with weight being the first (or key) column and the remainder of the columns corresponding to the zone -- which you obtain from the lookup in the zone file.


<P>
To adapt other shipper zone files to MiniVend's lookup, you will need to make it fit the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UPS</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>US</FONT> format. (Most of the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UPS</FONT> international files don't follow the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>US</FONT> format). For example, the 1998 Ohio-US to Canada file begins:


<P>
<PRE>    Canada Standard Zone Charts from Ohio
    Locate the zone by cross-refrencing the first three
    characters of the destination Postal Code in the Postal
    Range column.
 
    Postal Range  Zone
    A0A  A9Z      54
    B0A  B9Z      54
    C0A  C9Z      54
    E0A  E9Z      54
    G0A  G0A      51
    G0B  G0L      54
    G0M  G0S      51
    G0T  G0W      54
</PRE>
<P>
You need to change it to

<P>
<PRE> 
    Destination,canstnd
    A0A-A9Z, 54
    B0A-B9Z, 54
    C0A-C9Z, 54
    E0A-E9Z, 54
    G0A-G0A, 51
    G0B-G0L, 54
    G0M-G0S, 51
    G0T-G0W, 54
</PRE>
<P>
and match it with a <CODE>canstnd</CODE> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CSV</FONT> database that looks like

<P>
<PRE>    Weight,51,52,53,54,55,56
    1,7.00,7.05,7.10,11.40,11.45,11.50
    2,7.55,7.65,7.75,11.95,12.05,12.10
    3,8.10,8.15,8.40,12.60,12.70,12.85
    4,8.65,8.70,9.00,13.20,13.30,13.55
    5,9.20,9.25,9.75,13.85,13.85,14.20
    6,9.70,9.85,10.35,14.45,14.50,14.90
    7,10.25,10.40,11.10,15.15,15.15,15.70
    8,10.80,10.95,11.70,15.70,15.75,16.35
    9,11.35,11.55,12.30,16.40,16.45,17.20
</PRE>
<P>
and is called out in catalog.cfg with:

<P>
<PRE>    Database canstnd canstnd.csv CSV
</PRE>
<P>
With the above, a 4-pound shipment to postal code 
<FONT SIZE=-1>E5C</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>4TL</FONT> would yield a cost of 13.20.
