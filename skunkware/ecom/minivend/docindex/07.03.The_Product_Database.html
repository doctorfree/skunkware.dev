<P>
Each product you are selling should be given a product code: 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> short code that identifies the product on the
ordering page and in the catalog. You can use any combination of letters,
digits, dashes, periods, hash signs, or underscores for the product code.
The
<EM>products.txt</EM> file is a ASCII-delimited list of all the product codes, along with an
arbitrary number of fields which must contain at least the fields <A HREF="#item_description">description</A> and <A HREF="#item_price">price</A> (or whatever you set the PriceField and DescriptionField directives to).
Any additional information you want in the catalog can be placed in any
arbitrary field. See <EM>MiniVend Database Capability</EM>for details on the format.

<P>
Field names are case-sensitive. Unless you have fields with the names
``description'' and ``price'' field, you will have to appropriately set the
<EM>PriceField</EM> and <EM>DescriptionField</EM> directives to use the <CODE>[item-price]</CODE>
and <CODE>[item-description]</CODE> tags.

<P>
The product code must be the first field in the line, and must be unique.
Product codes can contain the characters <STRONG>A-Za-z0-9</STRONG>, along with hyphen (<CODE>-</CODE>), underscore (<CODE>_</CODE>), pound sign/hash mark (<CODE>#</CODE>), slash (<CODE>/</CODE>), and period (<CODE>.</CODE>).

<P>
The words should be separated by one of the approved delimiting schemes 
<FONT SIZE=-1>(TAB,</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>PIPE,</FONT> or 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CSV),</FONT> and are case-sensitive in some cases. If you play with the case of the ``description'' or ``price'' field, you will have to appropriately set the
 <EM>PriceField</EM> and <EM>DescriptionField</EM> directives.

<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CSV</FONT> is not recommended as the scheme for the products database. It is much slower than 
<FONT SIZE=-1>TAB-</FONT> or PIPE-delimited, and dramatically reduces search engine functionality -- no field-specific searches are possible. Don't use it unless you know
 <STRONG>exactly</STRONG> what you are doing -- you will be sorry if you do. Using 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CSV</FONT> for any small database that will not be searched
is fine.

<P>
<STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE:</STRONG> The field names must be on the first line of the
<CODE>products.txt</CODE> file. These field names must match <EM>exactly</EM> the field names of the <CODE>[item-field]</CODE> tags in your catalog pages, or the MiniVend server will not access them
properly. Field names can contain the characters <STRONG>A-Za-z0-9</STRONG>, along with hyphen (<CODE>-</CODE>), underscore (<CODE>_</CODE>), pound sign/hash mark (<CODE>#</CODE>), slash (<CODE>/</CODE>), and period (<CODE>.</CODE>).

<P>
More than one database may be used as a products database. If the catalog
directive <EM>ProductFiles</EM> is set to a space-separated list of valid MiniVend database identifiers,
those databases will be searched (in the order specified) for any items
that are ordered, or for product information (as in the <CODE>[price code]</CODE> and <CODE>[field code]</CODE> tags).


<P>
When the database table source file (i.e. products.txt) changes after import or edit, the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBM</FONT> database is re-built upon the next user access. No restart of the server is necessary.


<P>
If changing the database on the fly, it is recommended that you lock the
file while it is being modified.
