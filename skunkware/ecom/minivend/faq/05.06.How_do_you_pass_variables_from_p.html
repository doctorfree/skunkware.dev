<P>
No effort needed -- MiniVend does this automatically.

<P>
Every user session that is started by MiniVend automatically creates a
variable set for the user. As long as the user session is maintained, and
does not expire, any variables you set on a form will be ``remembered'' in
future sessions.

<P>
Don't use the prefix mv_ for your own variables -- MiniVend treats these
specially and they may not behave as you wish. Use the mv_ variables only
as they are documented.

<P>
Also, because you can set so many variables, MiniVend does not unset
variables it does not find on the current form. That means you can't expect
a checkbox to become unchecked unless you explicitly reset it.
