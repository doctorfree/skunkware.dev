<P>
MiniVend is not just a script. It is a combination of many programs, Perl modules, and links to other subsystems such as 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SQL</FONT> databases, CyberCash, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>PGP,</FONT> and the Glimpse search engine.


<P>
It is so big because it is more than just a shopping cart -- it is a
complete database access and retrieval application. It uses a lot of memory
because the author got a case of feeping creaturitis and added too many
features while attempting to maintain backward compatibility with older
catalogs.

<P>
This means that MiniVend is probably not a good choice for someone who is
going to offer only a few products. It is optimized for catalogs of more
than a hundred items -- catalogs that expect to change and grow over time.
It is suitable for very large catalogs.
