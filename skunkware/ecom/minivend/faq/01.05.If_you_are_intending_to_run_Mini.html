<P>
The great majority of ISPs provide some 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI</FONT> service, and more and more run systems that are compatible with MiniVend. The catalog configurator for MiniVend is designed to figure out many 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ISP</FONT> directory setups.


<P>
Almost any Internet Service Provider 
<FONT SIZE=-1>(ISP)</FONT> system
<EM>should</EM> be able to run MiniVend, but some cannot (or will not) run MiniVend at all. On top of that, many times 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ISP</FONT> personnel are too busy to help, won't help, or don't know enough to help. Some are secretive about details of the setup of their systems.


<P>
MiniVend does require a stable platform underneath it. Many 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ISP</FONT> servers are heavily loaded (especially low-cost
ones). If you run on a server which is constantly running out of memory and
file descriptors, you will not be happy with your results with MiniVend.

<P>
Virtual servers that don't provide shell access are not really usable for MiniVend without direct support from the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ISP</FONT> -- unless you are a CGI/Perl wizard who can figure out how to do it. 8-) It can be done (with a good deal of difficulty) on some virtual servers.


<P>
Iserver.com and others who use an chroot 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTTP</FONT> daemon for each user will require some
source-code twiddling to get the paths for vlink right -- the catalog
configurator will not do the trick. See the mail list archives for the
hack.

<P>
MiniVend does require a lot of memory, and it does run as a daemon. You will find that that vexes a fair number of ISPs. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>I</FONT> have found it difficult to provide power and speed without using memory, so it will have to stay that way for the time being.


<P>
All in all, you can have a fair amount of confidence that your 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ISP</FONT> can run MiniVend. Or, you can get one who will.
