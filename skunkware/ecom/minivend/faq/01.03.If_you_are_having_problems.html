MiniVend is not guaranteed to be supported in any fashion other than to
make full source code of the current version available. However, the author
is interested in making MiniVend as reliable and trouble-free as possible.
Forward bug reports, questions and comments to the mail list, <A
HREF="mailto:minivend-users@minivend.com.">minivend-users@minivend.com.</A>

<P>
MiniVend is powerful and correspondingly complex. If you are looking to
``point-and-click'' your way to a catalog, you probably should look
elsewhere. While MiniMate <EM>can</EM> make administration easier, you should not expect to put up a catalog with
no effort.

<P>
Do understand that any problems answered in this 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FAQ</FONT> or the documentation will likely be ignored. Other
problems will also be ignored if you don't:

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
mention that you have referenced appropriate items in the documentation and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FAQ.</FONT>


<LI>
<P>
include the various version information that is appropriate.

<LI>
<P>
mention what is (or is not) in the error.log files

</UL>
<P>
The official MiniVend web site is:

<P>
<PRE>    <A HREF="http://www.minivend.com/">http://www.minivend.com/</A>
</PRE>
<P>
The latest version of the software, this 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FAQ,</FONT> and the documentation, are available there. Your problem may not be unique -- check the site first. There is a search feature that encompasses the documentation and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FAQ;</FONT> there is also a mail list and an archive for it.


<P>
The most common problem on 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UNIX</FONT> is receiving the ``We're sorry, the MiniVend
server is unavailable...'' message. This almost always means that
permissions are not properly set up, or that the link program is not in the
right location.

<P>
If your provider uses 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI-WRAP</FONT> or 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SUEXEC,</FONT> it will probably error out if you selected 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UNIX</FONT> mode and didn't reply ``Yes'' to the question
 <EM>Do you use CGIWRAP?</EM>. To unset the setuid bit for another try, telnet in and do

<P>
<PRE>    chmod u-s cgi-bin/simple
</PRE>
<P>
where <CODE>cgi-bin</CODE> is the directory that the program is located.

<P>
To reenable it:

<P>
<PRE>    chmod u-s cgi-bin/simple
</PRE>
<P>
If that doesn't work, it usually means you are on a virtual host with
limited command set.

<P>
To verify that this is the problem, try temporarily changing the permission
of the MINIVEND_ROOT/etc/socket file to be read/write by setting in <CODE>minivend.cfg</CODE>:

<P>
<PRE>    SocketPerms 0666
</PRE>
<P>
If MiniVend then works you will have to make sure the user that the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VLINK</FONT> program runs as matches the user who is running
the MiniVend daemon. It is usual to create a special <CODE>mvend</CODE> or <CODE>minivend</CODE> user to run the daemon and the link program. This means the directory listing for your 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI-BIN</FONT> should be something like:


<P>
<PRE>   -rwsr-xr-x   1 minivend users        6312 Dec 30 11:39 cgi-bin/simple
</PRE>
<P>
and for the socket file it should be:

<P>
<PRE>   srw-------   1 minivend users           0 Dec 30 11:41 etc/socket
</PRE>
<P>
See the next section for troubles with running MiniVend on 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ISP</FONT> sites.

<P>
Beyond that, if you are unable to get MiniVend installed you should check
to see if you can run <EM>any</EM> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI</FONT> program from the path it is trying to use. The
next most common problem is the user giving the wrong information to <CODE>makecat</CODE>.

<P>
MiniVend is intended to work on Perl Version 5.005 and higher, but the
author does not have the resources (read time) to regression test all
versions with the different versions of Perl, nor the differing operating
systems that exist. MiniVend will definitely be tested with the last major
release of Perl at the time of package release. As of this writing,
MiniVend's version is 4.0 and Perl's latest release version is 5.005_03.

<P>
<STRONG>Please understand that the first remedy in the case of unknown problems will</STRONG>

<STRONG>be to upgrade Perl to the latest version.</STRONG>
