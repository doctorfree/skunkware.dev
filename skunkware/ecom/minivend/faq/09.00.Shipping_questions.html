<P>
MiniVend has one of the most complete and flexible shipping calculators
found in an ecommerce program. You can do most anything with a global
UserTag, even to the point of looking up a cost at a remote calculator.
(See the <CODE>[ups-query]</CODE> tag in the <CODE>flycat</CODE> or <CODE>usertag</CODE> directories for an example.)

<P>
However, all of this comes at the price of complexity. Many questions have
already been answered on the user list.
