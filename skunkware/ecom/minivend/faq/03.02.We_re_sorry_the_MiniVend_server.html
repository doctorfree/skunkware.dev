<P>
This is the most common problem on 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UNIX</FONT> systems. It almost always means that permissions are not properly set up, or that the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VLINK</FONT> program is not setuid. Try temporarily changing the permission of the MINIVEND_ROOT/etc/socket file to be read/write to all groups (
<CODE>chmod 666 etc/socket</CODE>). This must be done <EM>after</EM> the server is started, as MiniVend deletes and recreates the socket every time it starts. If MiniVend then works you will have to make sure the user that the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VLINK</FONT> program runs as matches the user who is running the MiniVend daemon.


<P>
&lt;
<FONT SIZE=-1>HR&gt;</FONT>
<STRONG>It is not recommended that you install the MiniVend software
as <CODE>root</CODE>.</STRONG> If you are setting MiniVend up for the entire machine, and not just as a
virtual host user, it is usual to create a special <CODE>mvend</CODE> or <CODE>minivend</CODE> user to run the daemon and the link program. This means the directory listing for your 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI-BIN</FONT> should be something like:


<P>
-rwsr-xr-x 1 minivend users 6312 Dec 30 11:39 cgi-bin/simple

<P>
and for the socket file it should be:

<P>
srw------- 1 minivend users 0 Dec 30 11:41 etc/socket

<P>
Once you have set up the software, you can easily install catalogs as root <STRONG>as long as your <CODE>umask</CODE> is set to 2 or 22</STRONG>.

<P>
(The following assumes you have made the MiniVend software owned and run by
the special user <CODE>mvend</CODE> and that each user has a MiniVend catalogs directory <CODE>/home/user/catalogs</CODE>).

<P>
<EM>The following policies should be automatically offered when
installing MiniVend 3.06 or higher.</EM>



<P>
The best way to set permissions on a multi-user system is to make all files
group readable and writable (660 or 664 mode). If you have a system setup
that places each user in their own group, then make
<CODE>mvend</CODE> a member of each user's group and set ownership and permissions with:

<P>
find /home/user/catalogs -print | xargs chown user find /home/user/catalogs
-print | xargs chgrp user find /home/user/catalogs -print | xargs chmod
g+rw

<P>
For best results, make the user's default umask be 2 so that they will by
default create files that have the proper permissions.

<P>
If you have all users in the same group, the above is not secure. You
should put <CODE>mvend</CODE> in a group of which no user is a member (perhaps mvend would be a good
choice) and then make all files owned by the group mvend and all
directories be set to mode 2775:

<P>
find /home/user/catalogs -print | xargs chown user find /home/user/catalogs
-print | xargs chgrp mvend find /home/user/catalogs -print | xargs chmod
g+rw find /home/user/catalogs -type d -print | xargs chmod g+s

<P>
This will make files default to the proper group when created (on most 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UNIX</FONT> versions, anyway). 
<FONT SIZE=-1>&lt;HR&gt;</FONT>


<P>
If you are on a virtual hosting system, the procedure varies. Making the program setuid should work for most systems -- if your setup uses 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI-WRAP</FONT> or another setuid scheme it should still work 
<FONT SIZE=-1>OK,</FONT> though you may have to

<EM>unset</EM> the setuid bit with <CODE>chmod u-s cgi-bin/simple</CODE> or the like. If you have a non-standard 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI</FONT> setup, as some virtual host systems do, you will need to know something about 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UNIX</FONT> and the web -- or engage a consultant -- to properly set the paths up. Usually switching to 
<FONT SIZE=-1>TLINK/INET</FONT> mode is the easiest thing to do, though with
 <STRONG>Iserver</STRONG> and a few others it may take more than that. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>&lt;HR&gt;</FONT>

<P>
If you used the <CODE>makecat</CODE> program to build the catalog, it should warn you if it was not able to make
the link program setuid. To set the program (in the file <CODE>cgi-bin/simple</CODE> in this example) to be setuid, you use the command:

<P>
<PRE>    chmod u+s cgi-bin/simple
</PRE>
<P>
<STRONG>Please understand that the first remedy in the case of unknown problems will
be to upgrade Perl to the latest version.</STRONG>
