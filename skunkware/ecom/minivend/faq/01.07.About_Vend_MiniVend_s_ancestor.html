<P>
Vend was written by Andrew Wilcox in the early part of 1995, and the first released (beta) version was 0.2. Vend 0.2 is the parent of MiniVend, and the first version of MiniVend (called Vend 0.2m7) was totally based on that. It added searching and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBM</FONT> catalog storage. Subsequent versions took parts from Vend 0.3, especially the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>VLINK</FONT> and Server.pm modules, which were adapted to run with MiniVend.


<P>
The first release of MiniVend (0.2m7) was on December 28, 1995, making it over four years old. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> veritable eon in web time!


<P>
Other portions of Vend, notably the database interface from 0.3, were
adopted, but the commonality between the original Vend and MiniVend is
minimal.
