<P>
This is a warning from Perl indicating that an empty value was found where
one is expected. The warning is left in so that you know that something is
missing.

<P>
Whatever it is, it can be found at the specified ``chunk'', or line, of
catalog.cfg -- if you use the #include capability, it would have to be
factored in as well.

<P>
The usual reason is that a file is specified in one of the directives
(usually one of <STRONG>Help SearchProfile OrderProfile Buttonbars UpsZoneFile</STRONG>) and does not exist. See the documentation for the directive on how the
file name should be specified.

<FONT SIZE=-1>&lt;H3&gt;</FONT> Mini-FAQ: Why isn't the error more
enlightening?&lt;/H3&gt;

<P>
Because Perl won't tell us what exactly went wrong -- see <EM>it's</EM>

<FONT SIZE=-1>FAQ</FONT> for why.
