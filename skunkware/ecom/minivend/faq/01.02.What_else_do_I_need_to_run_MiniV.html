<P>
MiniVend is a complex system requiring the services of other complex pieces
of hardware and software. While it can be very easy to install, it is not
always. You must look at the ongoing environment as well as just the
initial installation.

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Perl">Perl</A></STRONG><DD>
First of all, you need a recent Perl. MiniVend 4 will not run on anything
less than Perl 5.005.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG>Perl modules</STRONG><DD>
MiniVend <EM>will</EM> run with a stock Perl, but to use some features of MiniVend (like the MiniMate interface) you will need some extra modules. If you are on 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UNIX</FONT> you can use the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CPAN</FONT> module and run:


<P>
<PRE>    perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Minivend'
</PRE>
<P>
and it should install all of the modules necessary except the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBM/DBI</FONT> ones.

<P>
These modules are strongly recommended:

<P>
<PRE>    MD5
    MIME::Base64
    SQL::Statement
    URI::URL
    Safe::Hole
    GDBM or DB_File (comes with most i386 Perls)
</PRE>
<P>
These are definitely recommended:

<P>
<PRE>    Storable
    Bundle::LWP (contains MIME::Base64 and URI::URL)
</PRE>
<P>
These are nice to have but are not essential:

<P>
<PRE>    Business::UPS (comes with MiniVend)
    Term::ReadLine::Perl
    Term::ReadKey
</PRE>
<P>
You will need the <STRONG>DBI</STRONG> module if using 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SQL,</FONT> along with the appropriate 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBD</FONT> module for your database.


<P>
The recommended packages for ActiveState Perl for Windows are:

<P>
<PRE>    MD5
    MIME::Base64
    LWP
    SQL_Statement
    DB_File
</PRE>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>FUTURE:</FONT> The MiniVend setup program will attempt to use <CODE>ppm.pl</CODE>, the ActivePerl package manager, to install them at installation time.

</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Operating">Operating System</A></STRONG><DD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>UNIX</FONT> is best. The Windows version, while perhaps more than just a toy, is not suitable for high-volume catalog serving. This is mostly due to 
<FONT SIZE=-1>NT</FONT> not fitting the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UNIX</FONT> <CODE>fork()</CODE> model which works so well with MiniVend.


<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> catalog designed on a Windows machine should just move over to a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UNIX</FONT> machine with no changes, so Windows might be a suitable development environment.


<P>
Mac 
<FONT SIZE=-1>OS</FONT> is not supported. If the time comes when it starts to reasonably support normal 
<FONT SIZE=-1>POSIX</FONT> services, then an attempt to port will be made. This is not likely, in my estimation. MiniVend does run fine on 
<FONT SIZE=-1>OS/X.</FONT>


</DD><P><DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Machine">Machine</A></STRONG><DD>
The server should be fast and have lots of memory. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> 200MHz Pentium Pro or equivalent with 
<FONT SIZE=-1>128MB</FONT> of 
<FONT SIZE=-1>RAM</FONT> works well and can serve many catalogs if that is all it does.


<P>
If you are located on a machine with many hundreds of domains, as sometimes
happens with low-cost hosting operations, you can expect some problems. It
is difficult to maintain a stable environment with that many users.

</DD><P></DL>
<P>
MiniVend will run about as well as the platform beneath it. It routinely
runs for months non-stop in a stable environment.
