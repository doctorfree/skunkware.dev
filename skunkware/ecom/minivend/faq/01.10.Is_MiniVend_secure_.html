<P>
Maybe. It has been downloaded over 500,000 times (availability at 50+ 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FTP</FONT> sites means it is unknown how many more times than
that) with no reported <EM>system</EM> security problems. It uses the Perl Safe.pm module for user-embedded Perl
subroutines and conditionals to make use of those pretty carefree.

<P>
However, there are definite potential problems with credit card number
security that can be avoided:

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
<STRONG>Unencrypted credit card numbers stored on disk.</STRONG>



<P>
If you don't use MiniVend's encryption capability for encrypting credit
card numbers, or the real-time payment (CyberCash, etc.) interface, then
there will be unencrypted credit card numbers present in your session
database files.

<P>
If your system is the target of a break in, then these numbers would be available to any user 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ID</FONT> that can read the session files.


<P>
This is the reason MiniVend defaults to read/write permission for the
MiniVend user only.

<LI>
<P>
<STRONG>Unencrypted credit card numbers sent via email.</STRONG>



<P>
The same things apply for orders sent via email. If it is not encrypted with 
<FONT SIZE=-1>PGP,</FONT> then it is at risk.


<P>
The default demos also store the orders in the file etc/tracking.asc, so
you should check there as well if you want to scrub existing credit card
numbers on disk.

<LI>
<P>
Running in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>INET</FONT> mode from another machine.

<P>
If you are using 
<FONT SIZE=-1>INET</FONT> mode, and the transmission is going via the
network to another machine (i.e. not localhost), then you should be
possibly concerned about which wires your SSL-encrypted data is traveling
over. You should be behind a firewall, firewall router, or at least some
sort of spoofing-protected filter.

<LI>
<P>
Running 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SQL</FONT> databases without 
<FONT SIZE=-1>WRITE_CONTROL</FONT> or other permission blocks.
 

<P>
It is possible to enter arbitrary 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SQL</FONT> in some search definitions. Though MiniVend tries to block non-select calls, this is not bulletproof. It is best to have certain tables be read-only for MiniVend, i.e. no insert or update permission. For tables that must be updated (i.e. userdb, transactions, and orderline) should use the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>WRITE_CONTROL</FONT> capability and the NoSearch directive to protect them.


</UL>
<P>
The bottom line is that security needs to be your concern. MiniVend tries
to warn you and provide means for protecting customer data, but it can't
stop you from doing all unwise things. The author stands behind the license
for MiniVend and disclaims all responsibility.
