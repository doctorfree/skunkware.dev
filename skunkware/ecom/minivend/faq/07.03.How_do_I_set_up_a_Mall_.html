MiniVend can share product databases, session files, and any other
databases. It has many features which support mall building.

<P>
You can easily build separate and mostly identical catalogs which you link to via

<P>
But building a mall is as much an exercise in data and process as in
software. Consider the following questions:

<OL>
<LI>
<P>
Who will be clearing payment?

<LI>
<P>
What happens if everyone doesn't have the same tax rate?

<LI>
<P>
How will you clear orders to multiple vendors?

<LI>
<P>
How will you bring together multiple types of shipping?

<LI>
<P>
How will the vendors get product data (including images) to you?

</OL>
<P>
If you cannot answer those questions and then visualize how to build a
mall, then you probably should not try.
