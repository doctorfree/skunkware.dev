<P>
Usually it is for one of the following reasons:

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
It is of the ``It doesn't work. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HEEELLLP!!!''</FONT> variety. Such messages are often ignored
by people on the mail list. (They figure you need help if you are posting a
question.)

<LI>
<P>
The question is posted in 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTML.</FONT> Many people don't have HTML-capable mailers and will not bother to read it. Your message is more likely to be answered if you put it in plain old 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ASCII</FONT> format.


<LI>
<P>
You used the wrong return email address, or you spam-blocked the email
address. Most people will not field the instructions nor bother to re-send
when it bounces.

<LI>
<P>
The subject line is not informative. ``[item-list] tag'' is better than
``It doesn't work''.

<LI>
<P>
Information needed for support is not included or is not intelligible. Version of MiniVend, operating system and/or virtual server type, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTTP</FONT> server (i.e. Apache), and database types in use are all relevant to most questions.


<LI>
<P>
Question is answered in this 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FAQ,</FONT> the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>README,</FONT> or by doing a simple text search (with keywords you mention) in the documentation. Most people won't do manual reading for you -- they expect you to take the time yourself.


<LI>
<P>
The message does not mention what is in all of the error logs, i.e. both the main error.log and your catalog error.log. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTTP</FONT> server error log entries are also nice to know about, though it is understood that many people don't have access to them.


<LI>
<P>
The message does not mention what is 
<FONT SIZE=-1>NOT</FONT> in the error logs. If you don't mention it, it
will be presumed you did not look.

<LI>
<P>
No one knows the answer.
