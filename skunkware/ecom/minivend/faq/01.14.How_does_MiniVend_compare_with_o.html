<P>
MiniVend is a full-featured shopping cart with high-end power. It can and
does maintain databases of hundreds of thousands of items or more, and is
frequently used in catalogs with hundreds or many thousands of items.

<P>
MiniVend is database-based. It has a complex implementation and a fairly
steep learning curve. If all you are ever going to catalog is just a few
items, and/or the items will not frequently change, MiniVend is probably
overkill for your needs. It may make more sense to go with a simpler cart
that embeds the product information in the page and does not require
database setup.

<P>

When to consider a commercial product

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
you want power, but want to interact only through a site building system like 
<FONT SIZE=-1>MS</FONT> FrontPage or Netobjects Fustion


<LI>
<P>
you want to interact only through a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>GUI</FONT> like Windows and not edit files

</UL>
<P>
When comparing MiniVend to commercial products, the comparison is better
drawn to the higher end ones costing thousands of dollars rather than the
low end ones costing hundreds of dollars.

<P>
Subjectively, people have both good and bad experiences with MiniVend.

<P>
<PRE>    After investing tens of thousands of dollars and almost
    a year of effort in commercial software, we switched
    to MiniVend and were operational within weeks.
    -- large corporation
   
        MiniVend is too difficult for the user to configure. There
        are too many things that must be gotten just so.
        -- Small internet service provider
  
    I really like the new site, its laid out well and the
    documentation is so good I've decided to use it even though
    I'm not a programmer.
    -- happy prospective user
  
        Your documentation is awful.
        -- not-so-happy prospective user
  
    Your documentation is some of the best and most comprehensive
    we have seen for a freeware program.
    -- happy user
  
        And the your pages don't have the right information in
        them and that's MY FAULT? How about the fact that your
        configure script acts differently every time it gets run?
        -- not-so-happy user
</PRE>
<P>
(Obviously, mileage varies with the user. Thankfully, the happy ones *seem*
to heavily outnumber the unhappy ones...)

<P>
One user says:

<P>
<PRE>    -- MiniVend is an electronic commerce development environment; 
       *not* a shopping cart.
</PRE>
<P>
This is not far from the truth, though modifying the ``simple'' or
``basic'' demo seems to work for many users.

<P>
Despite being free, MiniVend will require an investment -- either your time
or the money to engage a consultant skilled in the web and in databases. If
given its due, MiniVend can provide power that no other free shopping cart
has.
