There are several ways, but this is a more complex question than it may
seem like it is.

<P>
You will have to deal with bad email addresses, deciding which information to send, showing delivery times, etc. You also have to be very careful with credit card information -- if you have not taken the proper security measures (by enabling 
<FONT SIZE=-1>PGP</FONT> credit card encryption or using CyberCash) you might just mail them their own unencrypted credit card number!


<P>
This is supported in Minivend via a UserTag, [email ...]. See the
``simple'' and ``basic'' demos.
