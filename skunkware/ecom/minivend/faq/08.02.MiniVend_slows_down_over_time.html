<P>
There are many possible reasons for this, but most have to do with memory
or session database size.

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
See the documentation on 
<FONT SIZE=-1>MINIVEND</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ADMINISTRATION</FONT> and learn how to expire your session database. If it gets many megabytes large, then accessing a key will get slow.


<LI>
<P>
Second, if your machine is memory-poor you will find that MiniVend gets
swapped to disk. Unless your system is very fast, this will greatly hurt
performance. MiniVend works best on a machine that rarely if ever swaps to
disk.

<LI>
<P>
Third, this often has nothing to do with MiniVend at all but has to do with your 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTTP</FONT> server. Any long-running daemon has the potential for a memory leak -- try stopping and starting your 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTTP</FONT> server and seeing what happens to performance.


<LI>
<P>
On Windows, you will want to stop and re-start your MiniVend server at
least once per day. You can use a system agent to automate it -- you will
want to stop the server to expire the session database anyway. You need to
do this because MiniVend requires the Unix-specific <CODE>fork()</CODE>
call to spawn multi-tasked servers, and without multi-tasked servers there
is a strong possibility of a memory leak -- especially if you use embedded
Perl or conditional tags.
