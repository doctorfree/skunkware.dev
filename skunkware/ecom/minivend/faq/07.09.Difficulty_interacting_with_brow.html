<P>
There are many possible causes for this error. Using MiniVend 3.08 and
above, the main 3 are:

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
This most common case is where the user bookmarks a shopping cart after
Recalc or bookmarks a checkout page. Those pages are usually the results of
form submissions, and are not really a candidate for a bookmark. You should
make sure you provide links to both of those pages on the <STRONG>interact</STRONG> special page (in special/interact if you have started with the demo).

<LI>
<P>
User hits 
<FONT SIZE=-1>BACK</FONT> with a very small cache. There are quite a few
users who have decided 10Kbytes is enough of a cache, and that won't quite
cut it. 8-) (Actually, they probably assumed the number to enter was in
megabytes.)

<P>
One possible cause is that you must define <STRONG>METHOD=POST</STRONG> in all of your forms, not <STRONG>METHOD=post</STRONG>. The lower case form is not recognized in the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTTP</FONT> spec.

<LI>
<P>
If you are using 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SSL</FONT> and don't have a later 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTTP</FONT> server (released after say September of 1997), there is a bug in earlier versions Microsoft Internet Explorer's version of 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SSL3.</FONT> Stronghold 2.1.1 works around this bug, so if you use Stronghold you should update.


</UL>
<P>
MiniVend also allows you to have forms with 
<FONT SIZE=-1>METHOD=GET.</FONT> To use, set the session 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ID</FONT> in your form


<P>
<PRE>    &lt;INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=mv_session_id VALUE=&quot;[data session id]&quot;&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
You might then try 
<FONT SIZE=-1>METHOD=GET</FONT> on forms that have problems. This may
prevent errors due to one of the causes above.
