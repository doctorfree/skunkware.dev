<P>
We receive many, many requests for this type of thing. The answer is almost
always no, we are not interested. We might be interested if there is a big
check or significant Perl expertise being offered.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Payment">Payment gateways</A></STRONG><DD>
There are literally dozens of different companies doing e-commerce payment
services on the web. We have received inquiries from many of them over
time. The only way we will consider putting in support for a specific
payment gateway is if it is a funded consulting project. This is usually
thousands of dollars and is prohibitive 

<P>
Users have integrated Minivend with many different payment gateways -- we
have done various versions of CyberCash, Signio, and Authorize.net over
time. We support CyberCash directly in MiniVend as the market leader;
Minivend 4 makes it pretty easy to integrate your own gateway.

You may list Minivend in your software directory, but we won't maintain the
listing and we don't want to be on your mail list.

You may distribute MiniVend unchanged on your 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CDROM.</FONT> We like to get a copy if you do, but that is
not strictly required.

<P>
You can't resell Minivend because it is Gnu 
<FONT SIZE=-1>GPL</FONT> licensed; but you can give it away. See the
www.gnu.org website for more information.
