<P>
This used to mean that you were totally out of luck. You probably still
are, but it is at least <EM>possible</EM> to run MiniVend on a virtual server such as 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HWY.NET.</FONT>

<P>
You should be able to use the tlink.pl program and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>INET</FONT> mode to start using MiniVend -- with quite a bit
of work. You will need to hand-edit all of the configuration files, and use
tlink.pl with the appropriate settings. Long term, you should put a
compiled tlink in place.

<P>
You will also have to start the MiniVend daemon via a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI</FONT> program that you write.

<P>
Bottom line: don't try this unless most people call you a wizard. 8-)

<P>
The MiniVend web site has pointers to ISPs who happily host MiniVend.
