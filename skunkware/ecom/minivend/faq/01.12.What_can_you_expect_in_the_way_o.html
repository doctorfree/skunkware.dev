<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>I</FONT> am interested in creating a better MiniVend.
However, it has become pretty popular and you should not expect individual
support.

<P>
What 
<FONT SIZE=-1>I</FONT> will typically do:

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
Follow up on cogent bug reports, usually with fairly quick response. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> bug is not that you cannot install MiniVend -- it is a demonstrated fault in the program logic that can be duplicated. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> cogent bug report is detailed and concise, and includes HTML/code snippets that demonstrate the problem.


<LI>
<P>
Take note of faults in the demo. Any fixes will be discussed on the mailing
list and <EM>may</EM> be fixed in the next release version of MiniVend. The demos are demos --
not a finished application.

<LI>
<P>
Take note of faults in the documentation and update the next release
version of MiniVend. If you provide edited replacement text it is
appreciated. The documentation source is available if you would like to see
how it is maintained.

<LI>
<P>
Try to answer some of the well-presented questions that appear on the
mailing list.

<LI>
<P>
Try to constantly and incrementally improve the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FAQ</FONT> and other supporting information.

</UL>
<P>
All of these are things 
<FONT SIZE=-1>I</FONT> try to do. There is no commitment -- check your license for MiniVend. All are done on a time-available basis. If you don't include all relevant information 
<FONT SIZE=-1>I</FONT> will probably ignore the question. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>I</FONT> answer on the mailing list so that information can get to more people and be archived for posterity.


<P>
What 
<FONT SIZE=-1>I</FONT> will not do:

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
Accept phone calls about MiniVend.

<LI>
<P>
Answer questions that are 
<FONT SIZE=-1>URGENT</FONT> or cry for 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HELLLPPP!!!!</FONT>


<LI>
<P>
Conduct tutorials.

<LI>
<P>
Visit a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>URL</FONT> to look at a problem.

<LI>
<P>
Conduct a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>Q&amp;A</FONT> to extract needed information.
