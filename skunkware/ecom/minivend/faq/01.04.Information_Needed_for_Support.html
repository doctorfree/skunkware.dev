First, check the the official MiniVend web site for information:

<P>
If you are unable to get MiniVend installed, it is almost always a problem
with your answers to its questions or with the the Perl installation.
Common problems include:

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
Your Perl has threading enabled. This may cause problems for MiniVend on
some operating systems. Try building a Perl without threading.

<LI>
<P>
Occupied default port (8786) or interfering firewall during the test. This
causes part of 'make test' to fail while MiniVend might still work just
fine.

<LI>
<P>
Very old machine or a machine with very low memory (less than 
<FONT SIZE=-1>64M).</FONT> The test programs might time out while MiniVend
might still work. It won't work very well; expect very slow performance if
you don't have sufficient memory.

<LI>
<P>
Bad installation of Perl. While not as common as it used to be, since Perl 5 is distributed with so many systems, it does happen. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> proper Perl will need to be installed.


<P>
If MiniVend does a core dump or causes a segmentation fault, this is most
certainly the problem.

<LI>
<P>
Inadequate system privileges or quota restrictions. If you have a virtual
memory quota then MiniVend can easily exceed it.

<LI>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>HPUX</FONT> may not be able to compile vlink.c and tlink.c.
Use tlink.pl as your link program. In addition, Solaris often comes with
either no tools or your path may not point to /usr/ccs/bin where some of
the tools are.

</UL>
<P>
There are many more possible problems. See the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>README</FONT> file for other OS-specific problems.

<P>
Second, double check that you have done the following things:

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
Checked <EM><STRONG>all</STRONG></EM> of the error.log files? There is one for each catalog, and a global one in
the MiniVend software root directory.

<LI>
<P>
Try 
<FONT SIZE=-1>INET</FONT> mode if 
<FONT SIZE=-1>UNIX</FONT> mode fails, and vice-versa.


<LI>
<P>
If you run 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI-WRAP</FONT> or 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SUEXEC,</FONT> have you turned off the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SUID</FONT> bit for vlink with a

<CODE>chmod 755 cgi-bin/simple</CODE> or the like? (The <CODE>makecat</CODE> program does this if you answer its question correctly.)

<LI>
<P>
Have you tried copying the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>INET</FONT> mode link program <CODE>tlink</CODE> over the
<CODE>/cgi-bin/simple</CODE> or <CODE>simple.cgi</CODE> program?

<LI>
<P>
That you have proper permissions on all files that need to be written. This includes the product database 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ASCII</FONT> source files, needed because of locking.


<LI>
<P>
If the function in question is from an external program (such as 
<FONT SIZE=-1>PGP)</FONT> you have tried the command <STRONG>as shown in the directive</STRONG>
from the command line, and as the <STRONG>same user ID as the minivend daemon</STRONG>.

<LI>
<P>
The vlink 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI</FONT> program is being executed on a machine that has
the socket file <EM>etc/socket</EM> on a directly attached disk. UNIX-domain sockets will not work on
NFS-mounted filesystems! That means the server <EM>minivend.pl</EM> and the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI</FONT> program <EM>vlink</EM> must be executing on the same machine. In most cases, you can use 
<FONT SIZE=-1>INET</FONT> mode and the tlink program instead if you must cross 
<FONT SIZE=-1>NFS</FONT> boundaries.


</UL>
<P>
If you have a problem you are not able to correct, and you have taken all
of those steps, you can send email to the MiniVend users list:

<P>
<PRE>    minivend-users@minivend.com
</PRE>
<P>
Please include your <STRONG>operating system name</STRONG> and <STRONG>version</STRONG>, your
<STRONG>Perl version</STRONG>, the <STRONG>DBM library in use</STRONG>, and the contents of 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ALL</FONT> error logs.

<P>
Please see this if you don't get an answer:

<P>
MiniVend is an ambitious and complex program, and is not presented as being <EM>easy to use</EM>, <EM>easy to install</EM>, or <EM>bug-free</EM>. The configuration script was done to try and make a very painful process
only slightly painful. Some people install in one pass. Others never make
it. Determined and thoughtful users almost always make MiniVend work.
