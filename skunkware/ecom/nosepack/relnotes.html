<DT><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A>
<DD>
The Non-Stop Open Source E-Commerce Pack is an integrated vertical
solution stack composed of Open Source software and providing Internet
Commerce capabilities. These packages were formerly provided as part of
SCO Skunkware. This release is has tailored the installation and configuration
toward E-Commerce deployment as well as deployment on a Non-Stop Cluster.
<P>
SCO Skunkware is the generic name for a free collection of Open Source software 
packages prebuilt and prepackaged for SCO systems. This distribution is 
a subset of the SCO Skunkware packages focused on providing a tightly
integrated Internet Commerce Application Suite. In addition, many of the
components in this release have been enhanced for deployment on a 
Non-Stop Cluster system thereby providing additional reliability and
scalability. This distribution is intended for use on the UnixWare 7.1.1 
platform. To obtain SCO Skunkware, see the
<A HREF="http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/">SCO Skunkware Web Site</A> 
or you may wish to
<A HREF="http://www.sco.com/offers/">order the SCO Skunkware CD</A>.
<P>
Distributions are released on CD periodically and a repository of this 
and previous distributions as well as updates and corrections can 
always be found at 
<A HREF="http://skunkware.dev/skunkware">
http://skunkware.dev/skunkware</A>.
<P>
SCO Skunkware contains a wide variety of software ranging from educational
and experimental research tools to commercial grade software suitable for
use on a production server. 
<P>
It is provided for free and is not formally supported by SCO.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="license">Licensing</A>
<DD>
The software on this CD-ROM is licensed under a variety
of terms. Much of it is licensed under the terms of the 
<A HREF="licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</A>.
Some is licensed under the
<A HREF="licenses/lgpl.html">GNU Library General Public License</A>.
Other components are licensed under the
<A HREF="licenses/Artistic">Artistic License</A>. 
A few components are commercial
products which can be used freely for non-commercial purposes (e.g. MySQL).
<P>
To determine the licensing conditions for a particular component, see the
corresponding source in the <I>/usr/local/src</I> source directory or read
the <A HREF=license.html>Non-Stop Open Source E-Commerce Licensing</A> page.
<P>
<DT><A NAME=uw7>Supported UnixWare 7 releases</A>
<DD>
This release of the Non-Stop Open Source E-Commerce Pack is only supported
on UnixWare 7.1.1 or later releases. It has been enhanced to take advantage
of the failover and scaling capabilities of UnixWare 7 Non-Stop Clusters.
<P>
<DT><A NAME=ssl>Exporting/Importing Secure Socket Layer Apache module</A>
<DD>
Some areas of the world may prohibit the importation of the encryption
technology in the Apache SSL module (mod_ssl) and/or OpenSSL. Other areas
may prohibit the exportation of such technologies to particular areas of
the world. You are strongly advised to pay close attention and adhere to any
export/import and/or use laws which apply to you. If it is illegal to use
or import strong encryption in your part of the world, this package can easily
be configured to not use the mod_ssl Apache module - simply comment the
mod_ssl lines out of /usr/local/lib/apache/conf/httpd.conf or start the
Apache web server without the -DSSL argument.
<P>
<DT><A NAME=dbl>MySQL and PostgreSQL licensing</A>
<DD>
Most of the components in this solution pack are pure "Open Source" packages
meaning they can be freely used, modified and redistributed in a commercial
setting. However, some components may require license fees when used in
anything but non-commercial or educational settings. In particular, the 
licenses covering MySQL and PostgreSQL should be examined prior to deploying
in a commercial setting.
<P>
<DT><A NAME=beta>Alpha and Beta quality software components</A>
<DD>
Some of the components in this release may not be production releases.
While these releases have been tested to assure their respective demos
run correctly, it is expected that the production releases will contain
many bug fixes and feature enhancements. It is probably a good idea to
track development of those components you deploy in business critical areas.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="disclaimer">Disclaimer</A>
<DD>
This is freely distributed and <I>unsupported</I> software.
No warranty is made on any of the components. Support and 
assistance with this software is not provided by SCO. In many cases, however, 
an e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:skunkware@ronrecord.com">skunkware@ronrecord.com</A> 
describing any problem you might have may result in a reply/fix/solution.

<P>
<A NAME="starting"><B>Getting Started </B></A>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><A NAME="mounting">Mounting the CD-ROM</A>
<P>
[Note that it is not necessary to mount the CD-ROM
in order to install the pkgadd installable packages. See the section
below on <A HREF="#installing">installing the software</A>.]
<P>
To mount the CD-ROM on an SCO UnixWare system, use the command:
<PRE>
    # mount -r -f cdfs /dev/cdrom/cdrom1 /<I>mount-point</I>
</PRE>
where <I>mount-point</I> refers to the full pathname of the directory on
which you wish to mount the CD-ROM (e.g. /mnt).
Note also that the CD-ROM device name may vary from system to system.
<P>
On an SCO OpenServer Release 5 system issue the command:
<PRE>
    # mount -r /dev/cd0 /<I>mount-point</I>
</PRE>
<P>
<LI><A NAME="moving">Making room for the software</A>
<P>
The installation of all the components will require approximately 250 Megabytes 
of free space on the root partition (/usr/local). If your root partition
does not have sufficient space, or you wish to utilize an alternate filesystem
for the components, prior to installing create
a symbolic link in /usr as follows (using /u as the alternate filesystem):
<PRE>
        # mv /usr/local /u/local
        # ln -s /u/local /usr/local
</PRE>
The above commands assume a separate /u filesystem with sufficient disk space.
The exact name of the alternate filesystem mount point is system dependent.
<P>
<LI><A NAME=cart>Which shopping cart to use</A>
<P>
We have provided two excellent shopping cart applications in this pack -
Enhydra and MiniVend. A third, OpenMerchant, is available for download via
the SCO Skunkware web site. We encourage you to play with all of
them and tell us what features you like or dislike about each. The choice
of which to use is yours.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="browsing">Browsing the HTML Documents</A>
<P>
For an introductory tour, point a web browser at 
<A HREF="index.html">
/<I>mount-point</I>/index.html</A>
<PRE>
    # /usr/bin/X11/netscape file:/<I>mount-point</I>/index.html
</PRE>
If you do not have Netscape Navigator installed, download a trial copy from
<A HREF="http://www2.sco.com">http://www2.sco.com</A> 
or use any browser that supports tables and open the URL file:/<I>mount-point</I>/index.html
(assuming you mounted the CD on /<I>mount-point</I>).
<P>
If you do not have or want a graphical browser, you can use Lynx
(a character browser) which is included as part of the UnixWare 7 installation.
Execute the command:
<PRE>
    # lynx file:/<I>mount-point</I>/index.html
</PRE>
<P>
This release contains files suitable for installation with the pkgadd facility. 
In addition, there are 
<A HREF="/src/">dozens of source archives</A>
(almost everything on the CD is accompanied by the source used to build it).
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="other"><B>Accessing the CD on other platforms</B></A>
<P>
On any other system, after mounting or otherwise making the High-Sierra
Rockridge CD-ROM filesystem accessible, point your WWW browser to
<I>mount-point</I>/index.html where <I>mount-point</I> indicates
the UNIX directory or Windows drive representing the CD-ROM.
<P>
<A NAME="source"><B>Source Code Distribution</B></A>
<P>
Source code is installed in the <I>/usr/local/src</I> directory.  
The source distributions are in gzip compressed
tar or cpio format. In order to extract these, use the command:
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>
$ gzcat /usr/local/src/&lt;package&gt;.tar.gz | tar xf -
</PRE>
</FONT>

or, in the case of a compressed cpio archive:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>
$ gzcat /usr/local/src/&lt;package&gt;.cpio.gz | cpio -icdu
</PRE>
</FONT>

Where &lt;package&gt; is the package name (e.g. gzip-1.2.4).
<P>
A full source archive for this and previous releases is available at either
<A HREF="http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/src/">
http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/src/</A>
or
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/src/">
ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/src/</A>.
<P>
<A NAME="config"><B>Default Package Configurations</B></A>
<P>
Many of the packages contain configuration files. In order to
avoid excessive user interaction during installation and to provide a
consistent and well integrated set of configurations, the 
packages have been pre-configured.
<P>
Generally, you will not need to alter the default configurations but you
may choose to do so. Some of the package pre-configurations are as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><A NAME="password"><B>Default passwords and usernames</B></A>
<BR>
Some components are installed with default passwords and usernames. 
You should change at least the passwords. These are:
<UL>
<LI>MySQL root user
<BR>
User Name: <I>root</I>
<BR>
Password: <I>mysqladmin</I>
<LI>Enhydra Multiserver Administration
<BR>
User Name: <I>admin</I>
<BR>
Password: <I>enhydra</I>
<LI>MiniMate, the MiniVend administrative interface
<BR>
User Name: <I>minivend</I>
<BR>
Password: <I>pass</I>
<LI>Webmin
<BR>
User Name: <I>admin</I>
<BR>
Password: <I>the root user's passord</I>
</UL>
<P>
<LI><A NAME="apache"><B>Apache</B></A>
<BR>
The Apache web server is configured to run on port 80. If you are
going to use Squid as an httpd accelerator or if you are running the
Netscape web server on port 80, you may wish to run the Apache
web server on port 8080. To do so, modify /usr/local/lib/apache/conf/httpd.conf.
Further, the default document directory for the Apache web server is set to
/usr/local/lib/apache/htdocs. If you wish to serve your HTML documents out
of a different location, modify /usr/local/lib/apache/conf/httpd.conf.
<P>
Apache has also been preconfigured to support the dynamic HTML scripting
language PHP, Secure Socket Layer (SSL), server-side Java (jsdk), name
based virtual hosts, and more.
<P>
<A NAME="webtop">
This release of Apache for UnixWare 7 has been preconfigured
to act as the server for the SCO Webtop. If the SCO Webtop is installed, you
can use a Java capable browser on any platform to open the URL
http://your.server.name/webtop to access the SCO Webtop login screen.
<P>
Finally, this release of Apache has been optimized for use on an SCO
Non-Stop Cluster. The default configuration, when enabled, will start a
separate instance of the Apache web server on each node. Each instance will
bind to ports 80 and 443. The round-robin load balancing provided by the
cluster will distribute HTTP requests across the cluster. This configuration
should provide both reliability (failover) and scalability.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="squid"><B>Squid</B></A>
<BR>
The Squid Internet Object Cache is configured to run on port 3128 and to 
act as a caching proxy server. Clients can configure their browsers to use
this proxy server for HTTP and FTP requests thus eliminating the need to
fetch unchanged pages from the Internet while serving these pages up from
a local memory cache. Squid can also be deployed as a proxy server providing
a single point of transfer across a firewall to increase security.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="enhydra"><B>Enhydra</B></A>
<BR>
The Enhydra Java and XML application server has been preconfigured to
run on port 9050. When enabled (/etc/enhydra enable), the Enhydra demonstration
is available via http://your.server.name:9050/ while the Enhydra administrative
interface is available via http://your.server.name:9050/admin with username
<I>admin</I> and password <I>enhydra</I>.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="minivend"><B>MiniVend</B></A>
<BR>
The MiniVend Internet Commerce application provides a shopping cart as well
as secure credit card transactions, shipping forms, on-line transaction
interface and database management systems. This sophisticated E-Commerce
application has been preconfigured to display the "simple" Art Store 
demonstration. To enable this demonstration, run "/etc/mvendrc enable". To
start the store demo right away, run "/etc/mvendrc start". Visit the store
by opening the URL http://your.server.name/simple.
<P>
MiniMate, the MiniVend administrative interface, is available via the URL
http://your.server.name/cgi-bin/simple/config/menu with username 
<I>minivend</I> and password <I>pass</I>.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="openmerchant"><B>OpenMerchant</B></A>
<BR>
The OpenMerchant Internet Commerce application is provided as a web/ftp
downloadable alternative to Enhydra and MiniVend. Download the pkgadd
installable datastream for OpenMerchant at:
<PRE><A HREF=http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/uw7/net/openmerchant/>
   http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/uw7/net/openmerchant/</A>
</PRE>
OpenMerchant has been preconfigured to display the
"Presents.com" on-line store. To visit this demonstration you will need to
configure a Virtual Host in your Apache configuration file httpd.conf as well
as register this domain with the Internic
(see <A HREF=http://www.internic.net>http://www.internic.net</A>).
<P>
Once registered and setup as a Virtual Host, visit the OpenMerchant demo by
opening the URL http://your.virtual.host/ and the OpenMerchant administrative 
interface by visiting http://your.virtual.host/cgi-bin/om/admin/login.cgi
with username <I>admin</I> and password <I>opensales</I>.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="webmin"><B>Webmin</B></A>
<BR>
The Webmin web-based interface for system administration has been preconfigured
to run on port 10000. When enabled (/etc/webmin enable), the Webmin GUI
is available via https://your.server.name:10000/
with username <I>admin</I> and the root password. Note that Webmin is
configured to use SSL to ensure passwords and other sensitive information
is secure. Because Webmin uses SSL for encryption only, the certificate
it uses is not signed by one of the recognized CAs such as
Verisign. When you first connect to the Webmin server, your
browser will ask you if you want to accept the certificate
presented, as it does not recognize the CA. Say yes.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="htmlman"><B>HTML Documentation</B></A>
<BR>
Several packages install documentation, manuals, tutorials and other
introductory and informative matter as HTML documents in /usr/local/man/html.
During the installation of these packages, a symbolic link is created in
the default Apache web server document root. Thus, the documentation for
these packages can be accessed via a browser. For instance, the HTML documents
describing the MySQL database server are installed in 
/usr/local/man/html/mysql.
A symbolic link pointing to this location is installed as
/usr/local/lib/apache/htdocs/docs/mysql. Thus, to access the Xcoral HTML 
documentation, you need only open the URL http://your.server.name/docs/mysql/
<P>
<LI><A NAME="sw98mount"><B>Web hosting the CD</B></A>
<BR>
If you mount the CD-ROM under your default document root,
you will be able to serve up the HTML documents
with your web server. For instance, after installing the apache and squid
packages, if you mounted the CD-ROM on 
/usr/local/lib/apache/htdocs/skunkware, then opening the URL
http://your.server.name/skunkware/ would allow you to browse the contents
of the CD-ROM from any browser that could access your server.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="perlmod"><B>Perl Modules</B></A>
<BR>
The Perl package on this release contains many useful
Perl modules including the MySQL, mSQL and PostgreSQL DBI/DBD interfaces. 
Additional Perl modules will be available via 
<A HREF="http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/osr5/interp/perl/">
http://skunkware.dev/skunkware/osr5/interp/perl/</A>. These include various
database interfaces, ImageMagick enhancements and more.
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="limits"><B>Known Limitations and Problems</B></A>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><A NAME=socket><B>MiniVend startup failure</B></A>
<BR>
Occasionally the MiniVend server encounters a problem on startup which
is reported in the MiniVend error log (/usr/local/minivend/error.log) as:
<P>
"socket: Invalid argument at /usr/local/minivend/lib/Vend/Server.pm line 920."
<P>
If this happens, restart MiniVend as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Remove the MiniVend PID file: 
<PRE>
    # rm -f /usr/local/minivend/etc/minivend.pid
</PRE>
<LI>Unregister MiniVend with spawndaemon: 
<PRE>
    # /etc/mvendrc stop
</PRE>
<LI>Kill any remaining MiniVend process: 
<PRE>
    # ps -ef | grep minivend
    # kill PID
</PRE>
Where PID indicates the process id of any MiniVend process from the ps command.
<LI>Restart and re-register MiniVend with the spawndaemon: 
<PRE>
    # /etc/mvendrc start
</PRE>
<LI>Verify that MiniVend started properly by checking the error log: 
<PRE>
    # tail /usr/local/minivend/error.log
</PRE>
</UL>
<P>
<LI><A NAME=reload><B>Hitting "reload" while viewing your shopping cart</B></A>
<BR>
Some users have reported getting dupliate shopping cart entries when
hitting the "reload" button in their browser while viewing the shopping
cart contents. This behaviour was reported with both OpenMerchant and
MiniVend. If duplicate entries appear in your shopping cart: 
<UL>
<LI>MiniVend - set the quantity of one of them to zero and press "Recalculate"
<LI>OpenMerchant - reduce the quantity by one and press "update"
</UL>
With any shopping cart application it is always a good idea to review your
calculated purchase quantities prior to submitting the purchase request.
</LI>
<P>
<LI> <A NAME="disk5"><B>Disk Space</B></A>
<BR>
  A full installation will require approximately 250 Megabytes of disk space. 
  If your system's root filesystem does not contain sufficient disk space,
  then you may wish to perform the following
  workaround (rather than removing files from the root partition):
<PRE>
      # mv /usr/local /u/local
      # ln -s /u/local /usr/local
</PRE>
  Where /u/local resides on an additional disk with sufficient space.

<P>
</LI>
<P>
<LI><A NAME="memfs"><B>The /tmp or /var/tmp memory filesystem too small</B></A>
<BR>
Installation of the package may fail due to insufficient space in
/var/tmp. If this happens, simply unmount /var/tmp with the command:
<PRE>
    # umount /var/tmp
</PRE>
and re-run pkgadd. After successfully installing, you can remount /var/tmp.
</LI>
<P>
<LI><A NAME="webmin"><B>Changing a user's password with Webmin</B></A>
<BR>
There may be problems with changing a user's password using the Webmin
system administration interface. Webmin can successfully create a user
and that user's password but has been reported to fail when attempting
to change the user's password. We are investigating but were unable to
either verify or fix this in time for this release.
