<H1>Thin Client Deployment at The City of Largo</H1>
<P>
<A HREF=mailto:drichard@largo.com>Dave Richards</A> of the City of Largo, 
Florida gave an interesting
presentation at SCO Forum 1999 on how the city has deployed a thin
client, server-centric solution. This has enabled the City of Largo
to operate more efficiently at a greatly reduced cost and with much
lower maintenance and support overhead.
<P>
The City is upgrading from a rack of SCO OpenServer servers to UnixWare 7.
In addition, they are converting their thin client desktops from XDT3 to
KDE (the K Desktop Environment). The City of Largo is an excellent example
of server-centric thin client computing deployed mixing commercial and 
<A HREF=/skunkware>Open Source</A> software.
<P>
Both the 
<A HREF=/skunkware/kde/>SCO OpenServer and UnixWare 7 releases of KDE 1.1.2</A>
contain alternate kpanel binaries  and configuration files. These are tailored 
for use in environments where KDE is pushed out to thin clients from SCO 
servers. Often in this situation the thin clients will utilize a local window 
manager to reduce network traffic. It's also common that these clients will be 
diskless and/or wireless. For these reasons, the kpanel functionality has been
configured alternately for use with thin clients. To use the thin client
kpanel, simply replace the <I>/usr/local/kde/bin/kpanel</I> binary with 
<I>/usr/local/kde/bin/kpanel_nc</I> and 
<I>/usr/local/kde/share/config/kpanelrc</I> with
<I>/usr/local/kde/share/config/kpanelrc_nc</I>. You will also need to add 
appropriate lines to <I>/usr/local/kde/bin/nc_logout</I> to logout a thin 
client user.

Here is <A HREF=html>Dave's Slide Show</A>. Click on any thumbnail to
view the full image. Click on the 1st thumbnail to start the show. The first
slide provides an overview of the architecture - 6 SCO OpenServer 5 servers
(recently upgraded to UnixWare 7 servers), 1 RedHat Linux server, 1 SGI Irix 
server,
1 NT Windows Terminal Server supporting a variety of thin clients and X 
terminals over a variety of connection mechanisms and application servers
including <A HREF=http://tarantella.sco.com>Tarantella</A>. Subsequent slides 
are simply pictures of the client hardware and screen shots.
<P>
Here's a brief description of each of the slides:
