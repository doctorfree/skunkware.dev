<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction (from the SANE <a href="http://www.mostang.com/sane">home
page</a>)</h1>
SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application programming
interface (API) that provides standardized access to any raster image scanner
hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner, video- and still-cameras,
frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE API is public domain and its discussion
and development is open to everybody. The current source code is written
for UNIX (including GNU/Linux) and is available under the GNU General Public
License (the SANE API is available to proprietary applications and backends
as well, however).
<p>SANE is a universal scanner interface. The value of such a universal
interface is that it allows writing just one driver per image acquisition
device rather than one driver for each device and application. So, if you
have three applications and four devices, traditionally you'd have had
to write 12 different programs. With SANE, this number is reduced to seven:
the three applications plus the four drivers. Of course, the savings get
even bigger as more and more drivers and/or applications are added.
<p>Not only does SANE reduce development time and code duplication, it
also raises the level at which applications can work. As such, it will
enable applications that were previously unheard of in the UNIX world.
While SANE is primarily targeted at a UNIX environment, the standard has
been carefully designed to make it possible to implement the API on virtually
any hardware or operating system.
<p>While SANE is an acronym for ``Scanner Access Now Easy'' the hope is
of course that SANE is indeed sane in the sense that it will allow easy
implementation of the API while accommodating all features required by
today's scanner hardware and applications. Specifically, SANE should be
broad enough to accommodate devices such as scanners, digital still and
video cameras, as well as virtual devices like image file filters.
<p>If you're familiar with TWAIN, you may wonder why there is a need for
SANE. Simply put, TWAIN does not separate the user-interface from the driver
of a device. This, unfortunately, makes it difficult, if not impossible,
to provide network transparent access to image acquisition devices (which
is useful if you have a LAN full of machines, but scanners connected to
only one or two machines; it's obviously also useful for remote-controlled
cameras and such). It also means that any particular TWAIN driver is pretty
much married to a particular GUI API (be it Win32 or the Mac API). In contrast,
SANE cleanly separates device controls from their representation in a user-interface.
As a result, SANE has no difficulty supporting command-line driven interfaces
or network-transparent scanning. For these reasons, it is unlikely that
there will ever be a SANE backend that can talk to a TWAIN driver. The
converse is no problem though: it would be pretty straight forward to access
SANE devices through a TWAIN source. In summary, if TWAIN had been just
a little better designed, there would have been no reason for SANE to exist,
but things being the way they are, TWAIN simply isn't SANE.

<a NAME="System Requirements"></a>System Requirements</h1>

<ul>
<li>
A UW7.1.x workstation. SANE uses the SCSI passthrough interface which is
part of the core OS since UW7.1.0</li>

<li>
The following pkgadd'able software packages (available from <a href="ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/uw7/Packages">here</a>):</li>

<ul>
<li>
<tt>sane-1.0.1.pkg </tt>(contains the SANE binaries, libraries, header,
doc etc.)</li>

<li>
<tt>glibs-2.0.3.pkg</tt> (or newer)</li>

<li>
<tt>gimp-1.0.4.pkg</tt> (The <a href="http://www.gimp.org">GNU Image Manipulator
Program</a>, this installation of this package is optional)</li>

<li>
<tt>xsane-0.50.pkg</tt> (optional, see details below, the current version
is 0.50)</li>
</ul>

<li>
A SCSI scanner (the current version of SANE for UW7.1.x doesn't support
parallel port or USB scanners). SANE contains drivers for the most common
scanners, like HP, UMAX, Epson, Canon etc. Click here for a full list.</li>
</ul>

<h1>
<a NAME="Installation"></a>Installation</h1>
Before you can install SANE you have to pkgadd the glibs package:
<blockquote><b>pkgadd -d `pwd`/glibs-2.0.3.pkg</b></blockquote>
Then pkgadd the SANE package:
<ul><b>pkgadd -d `pwd`/sane-1.0.1.pkg</b></ul>
This will install the binaries, librabries, header files, man pages etc.
in <tt>/usr/local</tt>. Make sure you've got <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> in
your $PATH. The installation of XSANE and The Gimp is optional but recommended.
XSANE offers a number of features xscanimage doesn't provide (xscanimage
is part of the SANE package). The Gimp is probably the best open source
image viewer and editor that is currently available.
<h1>
Configuration</h1>

<h1>
<a NAME="The SCOadmin Scanner Manager"></a>The SCOadmin Scanner Manager</h1>
Before you can use any of the applications, i.e. scanimage/xscanimage/xcam/xsane
you have to configure the scanner. The easiest way to do so is to use the
SCOadmin Scanner Manager. Start the client either via the SCOadmin launcher
or directly from the command line (as root):
<blockquote># <tt>scoadmin scanner</tt></blockquote>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>Note:</b> The GUI doesn't support the configuration of QuickCam cameras
yet. The devices have to configured manually by editing the appropriate
configuration files in <tt>/usr/local/etc/sane.d</tt>.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><img SRC="scannergui.jpg" height=390 width=662>
<br>&nbsp;
<h1>
<a NAME="Manual Configuration"></a>Manual Configuration</h1>
Edit the drivers configuration file as root and specify the scanner's SCSI
address or the address of the parallel port the QuickCam camera is connected
to. The configuration files are located in <tt>/usr/local/etc/sane.d</tt>,
e.g. <tt>hp.conf</tt>. Create an entry like:
<ul>/dev/passthru0:0,0,6,0</ul>
to reflect your configuration. The syntax is
<ul>/dev/passthru0:&lt;bus>,&lt;controller>,&lt;id>,&lt;lun></ul>
It is also necessary to edit <tt>/usr/local/etc/sane.d/dll.conf</tt> to
enable the backend that is needed to drive the scanner, e.g. <tt>hp</tt>.
Backends are disabled if the name of the backend is prefixed with a hash,
e.g. <tt>#hp</tt>. See also <a href="#Debugging">Debugging</a>. Only the
backends that are not commented out are loaded.
<h1>
SANE Applications</h1>

<h1>
<a NAME="scanimage"></a>scanimage</h1>
scanimage is a command line interface that if invoked without any options
reads the data from the scanner and prints the raw data to the screen.
<p>The command scanimage -L lists the devices that are available, e.g.
<ul><b>device `hp:/dev/passthru0:0,1,6,0' is a Hewlett-Packard C6270A flatbed
scanner</b></ul>
The simplest command to scan an image is:
<ul><b>scanimage > /tmp/out.pnm</b></ul>
There's a number of parameters that can be used in addition to control
the scanner (set the brighness, contrast, resolution etc.), e.g.
<ul><b>scanimage --resolution=300 --brightness=20 > out.pnm</b></ul>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>Note:</b> Not all scanners support the same set of options. The UMAX
S6E for example doesn't support the 'brighntess' and the 'contrast' parameters.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>Note:</b> There seems to be a bug in the hp backend. The value for
the resolution will be ignored if the resolution parameter is specified
before the mode parameter, and the mode is set to 'color', i.e.:
<ul><b>scanimage --resolution=100 --mode=color > /tmp/out.pnm</b></ul>
The scanners default value for the resolution (e.g. 300) will be used instead.
The problem won't occur if you specify the mode first.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h1>
<a NAME="xscanimage"></a>xscanimage</h1>
xscanimage is a graphical frontend to SANE.
<h1>
<a NAME="xsane"></a>xsane</h1>
xsane is another graphical frontend to SANE, but it provides more features
than xscanimage and is constantly being improved.
<h1>
<a NAME="xcam"></a>xcam</h1>
xcam is an application that provides streaming video from a Connectix QuickCam
camera. The application is not very stable. It is also not possible to
write the images continuously to the disk, i.e. record to disk. The other
SANE frontends can be used to aquire images from QuickCam cameras, too,
comparable to a snapshot camera.
<h1>
<a NAME="Debugging"></a>Debugging</h1>
There are a number of environment variables that can be set for debugging
purposes. The numeric value specifies the debug level. The smaller the
number, the less information is produced, e.g. a value of 1 will only bring
up important messages such as errors. For example:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>export SANE_DEBUG_DLL=1</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>export SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI=64</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>export SANE_DEBUG_HP=128</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>export SANE_DEBUG_UMAX=2</tt></li>

<li>
and so on</li>
</ul>
The value can range between 0 (for no output) and 128 (very verbose).

<h1>
<a NAME="Known problems"></a>Known problems</h1>
There appears to be a bug in the HP&nbsp;driver. If the user puts a sheet
of paper into the document feeder and changes the scan mode to something
else than 'color', the scan geometry gets corrupted. The 'Top-left' slider
is at maximum but still holds a value of zero. The will cause xscanimage
to exit with an assertion error. The document feeder works fine if the
scan mode is set to 'color'.
<p>Not all scanner identify themselves as scanners (SCSI class 3). Some
scanners vendors, like HP&nbsp;and Epson chose to report their devices
as 'Processing Devices' (SCSI class 6). These scanners are not autodetected
by the SCOadmin Scanner Manager.
