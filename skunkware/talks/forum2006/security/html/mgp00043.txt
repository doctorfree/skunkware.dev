Anonymous FTP

The anonymous FTP root directory and its subdirectories should not be owned by the ftp account or be in the same group as the ftp account. This is a common configuration problem.  

There is a risk to operating an anonymous FTP service that permits users to store files. CERT(R) strongly recommends that sites do not automatically create a "drop off" directory unless thought has been given to the possible risks of having such a service.

If your site is planning to offer a "drop off" service, it may be desirable to limit the amount of data transferred.  If possible, dedicate a disk drive and mount it as ~ftp/incoming.  The system administrator should monitor this directory on a continuing basis to ensure that it is not being misused.
