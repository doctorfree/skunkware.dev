Security Overview


"In the early days of corporate security, firewalls and proxies were considered a sufficient tool to protect an organization on the Internet. For both the corporate entity and hackers, an Internet connection was expensive, computing equipment was fairly expensive and firewall technology was new and not very well understood.

Those days are over and have been over for a long time. Internet connections are now fast and cheap. Security exploits of all operating systems and security software are available for free on the Internet, and in many cases these are extremely well documented. 

The expensive corporate security suite that you spend thousands of dollars on is available in it's cracked format from numerous download sites. A skilled hacker will be well versed in the use of your security tool. In some cases this individual will have a test lab, where he or she will test techniques such as Firewalking -a method of discovering devices behind a firewall, Session hijacking- a method of hijacking a TCP/IP connection, to name but a very few, before testing their findings and skills against your system."
