Enabling IPsec


IPsec is disabled by default. Note that it is important to configure IPsec as soon as it is enabled. If IPsec is enabled without being setup (or if it is setup incorrectly), overall system throughput will most likely be reduced due to the extra processing in the kernel required for IPsec.

To enable IPsec:

   1. Edit the file /etc/conf/pack.d/inet/space.c
   2. Change the line reading:
   ipsec_enable = 0
      to read as follows:
   ipsec_enable = 1
      Save the file.
   3. Rebuild the inet driver:
   idbuild -M inet
   4. Reboot the system:
   shutdown -i6 -g0 -y
   5. Once the system comes back up, log in as root to configure IPsec.
