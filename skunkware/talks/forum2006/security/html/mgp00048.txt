Setting Up and Using Secure IP


The IPsec (secure IP) protocol suite and associated tools provides the ability to encrypt and authenticate IP packets transmitted between cooperating hosts or subnets. IPsec is available for UnixWare and Legend.

When IPsec is configured for a given communication path between hosts or subnets, most of the IP header and the entire data portion of each packet sent over the network is encrypted by the sending host, and decrypted by the receiving host. 

This is in contrast to non-IPsec packets, which are not encrypted.

In addition to encrypting IP packets, IPsec can authenticate each packet using the information in the expanded header supported by this protocol. Authentication can also be provided using private keys and signed certificates.
