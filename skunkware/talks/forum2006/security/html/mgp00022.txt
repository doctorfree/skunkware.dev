Network Services


/etc/inetd.conf
/etc/tcp (OpenServer)

Disable any services which you do not require
Use tcp_wrappers or ipfilter to provide greater access and logging on any enabled network services
Check what services are running by using netstat and a network sniffer like netcat
Check what rpc services are running using rpcinfo
