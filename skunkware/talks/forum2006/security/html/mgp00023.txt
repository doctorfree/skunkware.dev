Best practices securing DNS 


Overview

Domain name system (DNS) servers translate names suitable for use by people (such as www.example.com) into network addresses (e.g., 192.168.4.22) suitable for use by computers. 

Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND), produced by the Internet Software Consortium (http://www.isc.org), is the most widely deployed name server package.
