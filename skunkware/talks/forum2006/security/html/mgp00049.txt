Setting Up and Using Secure IP (continued)


One of the uses of IPsec is to implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN). In a VPN, a non-secure communication path (such as an Internet connection) is used for the transmission of encrypted and authenticated packets between hosts that have been set up to use that path and only provide IPsec packets over the path.

A VPN is really a set of security associations established on each host that requires secure IP communications, along with a security policy established for each "subnet" in the VPN. Thus, a corporate VPN might be defined by a gateway router that allows a number of remote systems (or other gateways) to connect over public transmission facilities (phone lines, cable modem, wireless), and access the corporate network. A properly configured IPsec facility on the gateways and the various remote systems prevents the kind of security threats inherent in public transmission systems, such as spoofing, masquerading, denial of service, and others.
