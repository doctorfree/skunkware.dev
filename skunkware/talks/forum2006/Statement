SCO Statement on Open Source

Some Open Source technologies introduced to the market in recent years have
greatly benefited the information technology industry. As one of the
leading providers of UNIX-based solutions, SCO has added some of these
supplemental Open Source technologies as optional, value added components
within our UNIX operating system products for use by our customers. This
includes such technologies as SAMBA file & print services, the Apache Web
server, Mozilla browser and others.

A common value SCO shares with the Open Source community is in providing
choice to customers. We believe end users should have factual information
about the pros & cons of using Open Source and/or proprietary software,
including the level of risk, indemnification, support, rights, licensing,
and any other information that helps end-users best manage the lifecycle of
their software.

We continue to include some optional Open Source components that do not, as
far as we know, contain improper code based on SCO's or others'
intellectual property. As we determine that an Open Source product contains
misappropriated intellectual property, we stop all new shipments, and wind
down any customer support for such product, consistent with existing
contractual obligations to customers.
