Eliminate single points of failure 

To combat denial of service attacks and prevent accidental service outages, it is necessary to eliminate single points of failure.  Ensure that you have multiple physical paths to your network. 

Some common pitfalls to avoid are placing all of your name servers:

     On a single subnet
     Behind a single router
     Behind a single leased line
     Within a single autonomous system
