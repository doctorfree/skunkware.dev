Add appropriate Directory blocks to allow access only in those areas you wish. 

<Directory /u/*/public_html>
Order Deny,Allow
Allow from all
</Directory>
<Directory /usr/lib/apache/htdocs>
Order Deny,Allow
Allow from all
</Directory>

If you are using Apache 1.3 or above, we strongly recommend that you include the following line in your server configuration files:

UserDir disabled root
