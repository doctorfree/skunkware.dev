Watching Your Logs

To keep up-to-date with what is actually going on against your server you have to check the Log Files. Even though the log files only reports what has already happened, they will give you some understanding of what attacks is thrown against the server and allows you to check if the necessary level of security is present.

A couple of examples:

grep -c "/jsp/source.jsp?/jsp/ /jsp/source.jsp??" access_log
grep "client denied" error_log | tail -n 10

The first example will list the number of attacks trying to exploit the Apache Tomcat Source.JSP Malformed Request Information Disclosure Vulnerability. The second example will list the ten last denied clients, for example:

[Thu Jul 11 17:18:39 2002] [error] [client foo.bar.com] client denied by server configuration: /usr/lib/apache/htdocs/.htpasswd
