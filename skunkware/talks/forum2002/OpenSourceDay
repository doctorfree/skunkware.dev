Tony,

I have an idea for a quarry session at this year's Forum.
I'd like to invite a few of the Open Source luminaries like
Eric Raymond (www.opensource.org), Larry Wall (author of Perl),
Linus Torvalds, Jordan Hubbard (FreeBSD), Michael Tiemann (Cygnus,
author of g++). These panelists are joined by representatives from
IBM, SCO, Compaq, Dell, Intel for a roundtable discussion of the
budding relationship or portending marriage of the Cathedral and
the Bazaar. Focus is on ways in which we can leverage each other's
strengths. SCO brings a strong channel thru which Open Source developers
can get their software in the hands of high end volume Intel servers.

If we were able to secure such a distinguished panel, i'd also like to
send Forum invites to many of the developers whose software comprises
the Best of Skunkware. Another Forum event could be a presentation by
myself or some of the New Jersey dev sys engineers on Porting your
Open Source Application to UnixWare 7.

I've sorta pitched this idea to David Eyes and Mike Foster. I'm told
you are working up a theme for the quarry sessions. Would something
like this fit into your theme(s) ? If not, i suppose we could be less
ambitious and just invite some Open Source developers to Forum and
give the porting presentation.

At any rate, these guys i named above get Press with a capital P. 
Featuring them in a quarry session would get Forum a lot more coverage.
