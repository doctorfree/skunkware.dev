How Do I Go About Using It ?


Add /usr/local/bin to your execution path
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
export PATH

Add /usr/local/man to your MANPATH
Edit /etc/default/man or as above

Enable desired system services
/etc/apache enable ; /etc/apache start
/etc/squid enable ; /etc/squid start
/etc/samba enable ; /etc/samba start
Some scripts in /usr/local/etc
Run wmaker.inst to setup .xinitrc/.startxrc
