Hello Forum Speakers,

Here is an update on the schedule for your presentations:
- August 2: Draft presentations due to me: we want to review for messaging,
etc.
- August 10: Final presentations for inclusion in conference guide.  I will
give you
  an email address for submission ASAP.  If you miss this date, it is your
responsibility 
  to bring 250 copies, 3 slides per page.  This is to cover your session
and the extra
  copies that are put in the sessions room.
- Aug 15-20: If your presentation changes following Aug 10 hand-off and
when you give it,
  please submit it to adami@sco.com at least 24 hours BEFORE your
presentation.  This is
  EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, as they will be syncing an audio recording of your
presentation
  with your slides and posting them the web!  If what you present and what
Adam's team 
  has are two different things, this will truly mess things up.
- There is a speaker ready room, adjacent to Forum registration area in
Cowell College,
   which you can reherse, get refreshments, or just chill.

Other Misc Info:
- Each classroom with have an In-Focus projector
- You need to supply your own laptop to present from (if this is a problem, 
   let me know ASAP)
- Let me know by Aug 2 if you have other AV requirements, like video players
- The Forum presentation template can be found at:

Thanks,

  --Greg
