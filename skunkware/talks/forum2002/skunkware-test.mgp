Can I make money giving software away ?

%leftfill, size 5

	Create a market position 
		For proprietary software
		For training, services and support
	Free "widget" drivers can help sell widgets
	Sell accessories (e.g. books, training) 
	Sell the current revision, older revs are free
	Sell content, not software (e.g. subscriptions)
	Market brand rather than code
