Session D4: Open Source Tools, Skunkware, and SCO
Session Owner: Ron Record, Open Source Program Architect, SCO
Status: Confirmed
Session Description:
The UNIX technical community has a longstanding tradition of publishing 
the source code to programs in order to share technical accomplishments 
and facilitate peer review. A recent explosion of this effort has given
rise to a powerful and diverse set of freely available tools. This session
will highlight a number of these Open Source tools (Apache, KDE, GCC, Image
Magick, MagicPoint, The GIMP, and many more) and their integration into SCO 
OpenServer and UnixWare via Skunkware.
