        What's New in Open Source for SCO Platforms

    This session will detail newly introduced and upgraded Open
    Source components available for SCO OpenServer and UnixWare.
    The session will include a review of existing Open Source components,
    underscoring SCO's value-add in testing, integrating, maintaining and
    supporting the supplied components. We will list and describe what new
    Open Source components for SCO platforms we are providing and expect
    to provide in the near future.

    The session will conclude with the introduction of SCO Skunkware 6,
    the 100 or so new Open Source technologies being released in custom
    installable format for OpenServer 6. A brief overview of SCO Professional
    Services' porting services for Open Source will also be provided.

    Attendee feedback on issues raised in this session is highly desired
    as future work in this area is driven by customer, reseller and channel
    needs and requirements.
