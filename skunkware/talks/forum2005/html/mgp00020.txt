gwxlibs packages (continued)



GNU Crypto Library (libgcrypt)				1.2.1
GPG Error Library (libgpg-error)				1.0.0

In addition to these libraries, the GWXLIBS bundle also contains the following components, which are extensions or updates to versions provided in the base OS package which can not be removed or upgraded. These components install into the /usr/gnu prefix to distinguish them from the OS-provided components:

Tcl							8.4.9
Tk							8.4.9
Extended Tcl (TclX)					8.3.5
Expect							5.42

A gwxlibs for UnixWare 7 is used internally and will soon be released.
