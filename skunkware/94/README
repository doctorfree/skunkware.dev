		SCO Skunkware CD-ROM version 2.0


Howdy. This README briefly describes the top-level directory structure,
the spray and sprinkle scripts, and how to get started browsing the CD-ROM
with NCSA Mosaic. Skunkware 2.0 contains an extensive assortment of useful
tools, graphics, video, audio, games and interesting stuff. We here at the
SCO Skunkware foundry are particularly proud to be able to include the very 
first release of SCO Visual Tcl, a Motif-based graphical scripting language.

At the top-level of the CD-ROM you should find :

	CONTENTS - a sorted list of sums of all the files on this CD-ROM
	DIRS.LIST - a sorted list of all the directories on this CD-ROM
	INSTALL.NOTES - notes on the installation of the CD-ROM
	LINKS.LIST - a list of all the symbolic links on this CD-ROM
	README - this file
	RELEASE.NOTES - general information and introduction
	audio - directory containing digitized audio samples
	bin - directory containing executable binaries
	bin/X11 - directory containing executable X clients
	custom - directory containing custom(C) installable disk images
	etc - directory containing httpd configuration files
	games - directory containing executable binaries and associated files
	include - directory containing header files for xpm and MotifApp
	info - directory containing Information documents produced by Makeinfo
	interviews - C++ graphical development environment hierarchy
	lib - directory containing libraries, data, helpfiles, scorefiles, ...
	man - directory containing manual pages for Skunkware
	pics - directory containing GIFs, animations, and other graphical files
	src - directory containing the source used to build Skunkware
	tclX - directory containing the Tcl 7.3b support for SCO Visual Tcl
	tls - directory containing Technical Library Supplements
	xc - communications program xc

In the bin directory on the CD-ROM you should find two files named spray
and sprinkle. These are shell scripts designed to assist you in configuring
the Skunkware CD-ROM for use on your system. Most of the software on the
CD-ROM is executable directly from the mounted CD-ROM. However, some of the
programs expect files in a standard location (e.g. /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults)
while other programs need to be setuid root or uucp or setgid mem.

The spray script creates symbolic links in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults and
/usr/skunk/lib that point back to the CD-ROM filesystem. After running
the spray program as root, programs that expect to find support files in 
those locations will now work directly off of the mounted CD-ROM.
The syntax for invoking the spray script is "spray [mount-point]" where
mount-point refers to the absolute pathname of the directory on which
the CD-ROM is mounted. If no mount-point is given on the spray command
line, a mount-point of /usr/skunk is assumed.

The sprinkle script copies and sets permissions and ownership on the 
specified portions of Skunkware. Running the sprinkle script as
root will result in files residing on your hard disk with permissions
set to be setuid root, setuid uucp, or setgid mem. If you do not want
these permissions set, don't run the sprinkle script. However, there
are no known security problems with the permissions that sprinkle sets.
The syntax for invoking sprinkle is :
	sprinkle [-m mount-point] [all atc seyon xmcd memhog vg warp xc]
where "mount-point" specifies the absolute pathname of the CD-ROM mount point.
An argument of "all" causes sprinkle to install all of the components 
listed above on your hard disk with the appropriate permissions.

Should you need to remove the symbolic links created by the spray script,
there is a script called vinegar that lives in /usr/skunk/etc on the CD-ROM.
The useage of vinegar is identical to that of spray. The vinegar script will
attempt to identify and remove all symbolic links which point back to the
Skunkware CD-ROM mount point. You must have the Skunkware CD-ROM mounted at
the same mount point from which spray was initially run in order for vinegar
to correctly remove the links created by spray.

Finally, you may want to explore the Skunkware CD-ROM with Mosaic.
Mosaic is a "networked information discovery, retrieval, and collaboration
tool and World Wide Web browser developed at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications" (whew). Skunkware includes many HTML (Hyper-Text
Markup Language) documents which provide a hyper-media interface to many
of the Skunkware packages. To use Mosaic, all you need do is execute :

	$ /usr/skunk/bin/X11/Mosaic 

You must be running X since Mosaic is a Motif X11 client.

The default home page is configured for Skunkware browsing. If you already 
have a Mosaic home page configured, then you can browse the Skunkware CD-ROM 
by opening the URL (Universal Resource Locater) :

	file:/usr/skunk/lib/X11/Mosaic/index.html

To start Mosaic with the Skunkware browsing page, execute :

	$ /usr/skunk/bin/X11/Mosaic -home file:/usr/skunk/lib/X11/Mosaic/index.html

Mosaic uses tcp/ip. If you do not have tcp/ip configured in your kernel,
you will see errors to the effect that /dev/socksys could not be opened.
These errors will not interfere with the safe operation of Mosaic and
the local browsing of Skunkware documents. If you would like to avoid these
error messages, use netconfig to add the tcp/ip to loopback chain.

You do not need internet access to browse the Skunkware CD-ROM.
If your site does not have internet access, some of the hyper-text links
will generate an error message to the effect that the requested document
could not be accessed. If that is the case, click the "Back" button to
return to the previous page and begin work on obtaining internet access.

To summarize, this CD-ROM contains an EAFS filesystem which should be mounted
on /usr/skunk (as root, "mkdir /usr/skunk; mount -r /dev/rcd0 /usr/skunk). In
order to run many of the programs directly off of the CD-ROM filesystem, run
the shell script "/usr/skunk/bin/spray". To run additional programs that 
require write permission or setuid/setgid bits, run the shell script
"/usr/skunk/bin/sprinkle". After running spray and (optionally) sprinkle,
browse the contents of the CD-ROM by running "/usr/skunk/bin/X11/Mosaic".

Have fun and be productive,
