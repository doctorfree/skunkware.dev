   It occurs to me as we're all sitting here 
thinking of Mickey, he's probably somewhere getting an earful 
from Casey Stengel, and no doubt quite confused by now.<P>
   One of Mickey's fondest wishes was that he be remembered as 
a great teammate, to know that the men he played with thought 
well of him.<P>
   But it was more than that. Moose and Whitey and Tony and 
Yogi and Bobby and Hank, what a remarkable team you were. And 
the stories of the visits you guys made to Mickey's bedside 
the last few days were heartbreakingly tender. It meant 
everything to Mickey, as would the presence of so many 
baseball figures past and present here today.<P>
   I was honored to be asked to speak by the Mantle family 
today. I am not standing here as a broadcaster. Mel Allen is 
the eternal voice of the Yankees and that would be his place. 
And there are others here with a longer and deeper association 
with Mickey than mine.<P>
   But I guess I'm here, not so much to speak for myself as to 
simply represent the millions of baseball-loving kids who grew 
up in the '50s and '60s and for whom Mickey Mantle was 
baseball.<P>
   And more than that, he was a presence in our lives -- a 
fragile hero to whom we had an emotional attachment so strong 
and lasting that it defied logic. Mickey often said he didn't 
understand it, this enduring connection and affection -- for 
men now in their 40s and 50s, otherwise perfectly sensible, 
who went dry in the mouth and stammered like schoolboys in the 
presence of Mickey Mantle.<P>
   Maybe Mick was uncomfortable with it, not just because of 
his basic shyness, but because he was always too honest to 
regard himself as some kind of deity.<P>
   But that was never really the point. In a very different 
time than today, the first baseball commissioner, Kenesaw 
Mountain Landis, said every boy builds a shrine to some 
baseball hero, and before that shrine, a candle always burns.<P>
   For a huge portion of my generation, Mickey Mantle was that 
baseball hero. And for reasons that no statistics, no dry 
recitation of facts can possibly capture, he was the most 
compelling baseball hero of our lifetime. And he was our 
symbol of baseball at a time when the game meant something to 
us that perhaps it no longer does.<P>
   Mickey Mantle had those dual qualities so seldom seen, 
exuding dynamism and excitement but at the same time touching 
your heart -- flawed, wounded. We knew there was something 
poignant about Mickey Mantle before we knew what poignant 
meant.<P>
   We didn't just root for him -- we felt for him.<P>
   Long before many of us ever cracked a serious book, we knew 
something about mythology as we watched Mickey Mantle run out 
a home run through the lengthening shadows of a late Sunday 
afternoon at Yankee Stadium.<P>
   There was greatness in him, but vulnerability, too.<P>
   He was our guy. When he was hot, we felt great. When he 
slumped or got hurt, we sagged a bit, too. We tried to crease 
our caps like him; kneel in an imaginary on-deck circle like 
him; run like him heads down, elbows up.<P>
   Billy Crystal is here today. Billy says that at his bar 
mitzvah he spoke in an Oklahoma drawl. Billy's here today 
because he loved Mickey Mantle, and millions more who felt 
like him are here today in spirit as well.<P>
   It's been said that the truth is never pure and rarely 
simple.<P>
   Mickey Mantle was too humble and honest to believe that 
the whole truth about him could be found on a Wheaties box or 
a baseball card. But the emotional truths of childhood have a 
power to transcend objective fact. They stay with us through 
all the years, withstanding the ambivalence that so often 
accompanies the experiences of adults.<P>
   That's why we can still recall the immediate tingle in 
that instant of recognition when a Mickey Mantle popped up in 
a pack of Topps bubble gum cards -- a treasure lodged between 
an Eli Grba and a Pumpsie Green.<P>
   That's why we smile today, recalling those October 
afternoons when we'd sneak a transistor radio into school to 
follow Mickey and the Yankees in the World Series.<P>
   Or when I think of Mr. Tomasee, a very wise sixth-grade 
teacher who understood that the World Series was more 
important, at least for one day, than any school lesson could 
be. So he brought his black-and-white TV from home, plugged 
it in and let us watch it right there in school through the 
flicker and the static. It was richer and more compelling 
than anything I've seen on a high-resolution, big-screen TV.<P>
   Of course, the bad part, Bobby, was that Koufax struck 15 
of you guys out that day.<P>
   My phone's been ringing the past few weeks as Mickey 
fought for his life. I've heard from people I hadn't seen or 
talked to in years -- guys I played stickball with, even some 
guys who took Willie's side in those endless Mantle-Mays 
arguments. They're grown up now. They have their families. 
They're not even necessarily big baseball fans anymore. But 
they felt something hearing about Mickey, and they figured I 
did, too.<P>
   In the last year, Mickey Mantle, always so hard on 
himself, finally came to accept and appreciate that 
distinction between a role model and a hero. The first he 
often was not, the second he always will be.<P>
   In the end, people got it. And Mickey Mantle got from 
America something other than misplaced and mindless celebrity 
worship. He got something far more meaningful. He got love -- 
love for what he had been; love for what he made us feel; 
love for the humanity and sweetness that was always there 
mixed in with the flaws and all the pain that wracked his 
body and his soul.<P>
   We wanted to tell him that it was OK, that what he had 
been was enough. We hoped he felt that Mutt Mantle would have 
understood and that Merlyn and the boys loved him.<P>
   And then in the end, something remarkable happened -- the 
way it does for champions. Mickey Mantle rallied. His heart 
took over, and he had some innings as fine as any in 1956 or 
with his buddy, Roger, in 1961.<P>
   But this time, he did it in the harsh and trying summer of 
'95. And what he did was stunning. The sheer grace of that 
ninth inning -- the humility, the sense of humor, the total 
absence of self-pity, the simple eloquence and honesty of his 
pleas to others to take heed of his mistakes.<P>
   All of America watched in admiration. His doctors said he 
was, in many ways, the most remarkable patient they'd ever 
seen. His bravery, so stark and real, that even those used to 
seeing people in dire circumstances were moved by his 
example.<P>
   Because of that example, organ donations are up 
dramatically all across America. A cautionary tale has been 
honestly told and perhaps will affect some lives for the 
better.<P>
   And our last memories of Mickey Mantle are as heroic as 
the first.<P>
   None of us, Mickey included, would want to be held to 
account for every moment of our lives. But how many of us 
could say that our best moments were as magnificent as his?<P>
   This is the cartoon from this morning's Dallas Morning 
News. Maybe some of you saw it. It got torn a little bit on 
the way to the hotel to here. There's a figure here -- St. 
Peter, I take it to be -- with his arm around Mickey, that broad back and the number 7. He's holding his book of admissions. 
He says ''Kid, that was the most courageous ninth inning I've 
ever seen.''<P>
   It brings to mind a story Mickey liked to tell on himself 
and maybe some of you have heard it. He pictured himself at 
the pearly gates, met by St. Peter, who shook his head and 
said, ''Mick, we checked the record. We know some of what went 
on. Sorry, we can't let you in. But before you go, God wants 
to know if you'd sign these six dozen baseballs.''<P>
   Well, there were days when Mickey Mantle was so darn good 
that we kids would bet that even God would want his 
autograph. But like the cartoon says, I don't think Mick 
needed to worry much about the other part.<P>
   I just hope God has a place for him where he can run 
again. Where he can play practical jokes on his teammates and 
smile that boyish smile, 'cause God knows, no one's perfect. 
And God knows there's something special about heroes.<P>
   So long, Mick. Thanks.<P>
