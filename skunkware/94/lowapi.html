<H2>Introduction</H2> 
</CENTER>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
This document describes the context-sensitive help functionality that
is available for X clients in Everest.  It provides some general background
information, details
about using help and the help api, and information about authoring help
files.  It is designed for both client developers and authors responsible for
writing online help (although it does assume some level of knowledge
about Motif/X).
<P>
This document does not cover adding help to vtcl applications, although
the same document architecture applies.
<H3>Revision History</H3>
<DL>
<DT> 30 June 95 
<DD> Created this document from Help Api Functional Specification for Everest
</DL>
<CENTER>
<H2>General Information</H2>
</CENTER>
Graphical help is currently implemented as a separate client process, 
scohelp, which acts as a help server for a particular display.
Scohelp is based on Mosaic, a general-purpose networked browser written by the
National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).
The following sections provide the general background information necessary
to understand the api described in this document.

<H3>Summary of Terms</H3>
Following is a summary of some the most common terminology used throughout 
this document:
<DL>
<I><DT>help server</I><DD>
General term for the client responsible for displaying help on a particular
display, in this case scohelp.  In the current implementation there
is only one help server per display, per machine.  
<P>
This should not be confused with the \fIhttp server\fR which is responsible
for sending HTML documents to the scohelp (or mosaic) clients.  
The <I>http server</I>
will be documented as part of the scohelp functional specification.
<P><I><DT>browser</I><DD>
Synonymous with \fIhelp server\fR in the context of this document.
<P><I><DT>viewer</I><DD>
Synonymous with \fIhelp server\fR in the context of this document.
<P><I><DT>client</I><DD>
Refers to any Motif/X application.
<P><I><DT>help api</I><DD>
A programmatic interface that enables a developer to add help to 
X/Motif applications.
<P><I><DT>hard-coded topic</I><DD>
A literal string representing the name of a topic within a help book.
<P><I><DT>topic name</I><DD>
Synonymous with <I>hard-coded topic name</I>.
<P><I><DT>hook file</I><DD>
A simple text file that provides a mechanism for mapping 
hard-coded topic names to actual topics.
<P><I><DT>help request</I><DD>
The request sent from the client to the help server indicating which
help topic and book to display.  The request is sent as a result
of the user requesting help within an application (eg., via the Help
menu).
<P><I><DT>help book</I><DD>
The online documentation unit that contains all the help information about
a particular client or set of clients.  In scohelp a help book is actually
the name of a directory that contains all of the help topics contained
within a particular book (eg., XDeskHelp).
<P><I><DT>help topic</I><DD>
A help topic is the unit of documentation displayed when a user requests help.
In scohelp, the help topic is typically a single physical file that resides 
within the help book directory.
<P><I><DT>help window</I><DD>
A scohelp window, or document viewing area, that is associated with a 
particular client.
<P><I><DT>docServer</I><DD>
A SCOhelp resource used by the help viewer that specifies the 
location of help books.  By default the documentation resides on the
local machine (in /usr/lib/scohelp).
</DL>

<H3>Help Requests</H3>
Since context-sensitive help is provided via a separate server process,
when this document refers to the "help api" it is really referring to
the set of routines that enable an X client to communicate with the
help server.  When a user requests help in a client, the help api
is responsible for communicating this request to the server.
Note that the descriptions provided here are meant to provide a basic
understanding of the concepts, not a detailed technical explanation.
Implementation and usage
details are provided in later sections.

<H4>Using Hard-coded Topic Names</H4>
Most help systems only support the use of hard-coded,
or literal,
topic names.  A hard-coded topic name is essentially just a string, 
or tag, that is associated with part of an application (such as a window
or widget).  This tag represents the name of a valid topic in a help book.
When a user requests help from within a client this tag, or topic name,
is what is sent to the help server.  It is the responsibility of the 
application programmer to associate this topic name appropriately so that when
the user requests help a meaningful help topic is displayed
by the help viewer.  This association is typically done through
the use of the helpCallback facility provided by Motif.
<P>
Although using hard-coded topic names is fairly simple conceptually,
there are some definite disadvantages to this approach:
<UL>
<LI>
It typically requires that the application programmer "litter" the code
with calls to help.  At the very least it requires some specific forethought
on how to associate the topic names with the correct pieces of the application.
The more complicated the client the more tedious this task becomes.
<LI>
It requires a great deal of interaction between writers and 
programmers - both to decide where help needs to be associated and what 
the topic names should be.  It also means that it is difficult 
to add/change help topics after a source code freeze.
</UL>

<CENTER>
<H2>Using Help</H2>
</CENTER>
There are multiple ways that a user may request help from within a client:
<UL>
<LI>
Help pulldown menus
<LI>
Help buttons 
<LI>
Pressing the &lt;F1&gt; key when the mouse cursor is over the widget (or general
context) for which help is desired
</UL>
<P>
All of these methods result in a request being sent to the help 
server indicating which help book and topic should be displayed.  
While this request is being sent, a wait cursor should be displayed
to provide the user with visual feedback.
General descriptions of the behaviour the user should see in various
situations are provided in the following sections. 
<P>
Note that a given client may support any, all, or none
of the above methods.  Any deviations from the functionality described here
should ideally be documented in the functional specification for the client
in question (at least in the case of clients actively supported by SCO).
Also, the behaviour described here is dependent on the online documentation
provided.  If the online documentation is incorrect or incomplete then
help will not work correctly.
<P>
The technical details about what the developer and author actually
need to do to make this behaviour occur are provided in the sections
below, "Adding Help to an X Client" and "Authoring Help Files".
<H3>The Help Menu</H3>
A Help pulldown menu is available in the menu bar of many scoclients.
There are seven possible options to select from, although not all will
necessarily be present in every client.  The following lists the possible
items along with a description of the behaviour that should occur when 
the item is selected from the Help menu:
<DL>
<DT>On Context<DD>
Selecting On Context allows the user to select the context 
for which help is desired.  The cursor is first changed to the standard
Motif help cursor (a question mark with an arrow at the bottom indicating
the hot spot).  The user can then select a widget within
the client by placing the cursor over the spot of interest and clicking
the left mouse button.  The help server should then display information
about the particular widget (or general context) where the selection was
made.  The level of detail displayed depends on how the documentation for
that particular client has been written and organized.
<P>
If the user makes a selection outside of the client window (or in the window
border) an error message is displayed indicating that help must
be requested from within the application.
<P><DT>On Window<DD>
Selecting this item should result in the help server displaying general
information about the window from which the selection was made. In
scomail, for example, selecting Help On Window from the "Create Message"
window should display general information about creating mail messages.
<P><DT>On Keys<DD>
Should result in the help server displaying information about the accelerator
keys and mnemonics available in the client.
<P><DT>Index<DD>
Should result in the display of the Index for that particular client's 
help book.
<P><DT>On Help<DD>
Selecting Help On Help should display general information about
using the help system.  The topic displayed should probably be the same
for all clients that are using scohelp to provide help services.
<P><DT>Tutorial<DD>
Results in the help server bringing up a tutorial about the client.
<P><DT>On Version<DD>
Causes an application-specific dialog box containing version information
about the client to come up.  On Version is the only item in the Help menu 
that does not result in a request being sent to the help server.
</DL>
<P>
None of the Help menu items described above are required, it is up to the
client developer to decide which options are appropriate for each client,
and create the specified user interface in a manner consistent with other 
X clients.

<H3>Help Buttons</H3>
Clients may provide Help buttons in dialog boxes or in place of the
Help pulldown menu.  Pressing a Help button should cause the
help server to display general information about the dialog box 
or window from which the Help button was pressed.
<H3>Using the &lt;F1&gt; Key</H3>
The &lt;F1&gt; key provides equivalent functionality to Help On Context,
that is, it should provide help on the specific context in which
help is requested.  Pressing &lt;F1&gt; when the mouse pointer is
over a widget (in a client that has focus) should
cause help for that particular widget or general context to
be displayed.  As with Help On Context, the level of detail 
that is actually displayed depends on how the documentation
for the client has been written and organized.  The primary
difference between using &lt;F1&gt; and Help On Context 
is that &lt;F1&gt; allows you to request help in situations where
Help On Context can't be used (eg., requesting help for
an item in a pulldown menu).
<CENTER>
<H2>The Help Server</H2>
</CENTER>
This section contains general information about the behaviour of the help 
server, scohelp.
<H3>Standalone vs. Server Mode</H3>
When scohelp is started from the command line it is said to be
running in \fBstandalone mode\fR, when it is invoked from a client to provide 
help it is referred to as being in \fBserver mode\fR.  A scohelp client
that is running standalone will never act as a help server.  Consequently
if scohelp is brought up from the command line and help is then requested
from a client, the client would start up a second scohelp process
to act as the help server rather than attempt to attach to the first
process.  This behaviour differs from the previous scohelp
client (Bookreader) in that Bookreader did not distinguish between 
server and standalone mode.
On a given display there can be any number
of standalone scohelp processes, but there should be at most one
scohelp process acting as a help server.
<P>
The process command <B>ps(C)</B> will show that one of the command line
arguments to the scohelp process is "-cshelpservermode" when it is in
server mode.
<H3>Management of Help Windows</H3>
Each client process that requests help will automatically have a \fBprimary
help window\fR associated with it.  Subsequent requests for help from
the same client process will cause the contents of the primary help window to 
change rather than opening a new window (or replacing the contents
of some arbitrary help window).  In addition, any other help windows
that are created from the primary help window of a client (ie., via the 
New Window command)
will also be associated with that client.  When a client exits, all
of the help windows associated with that client should automatically
close.  
<P>
Selecting "Close Window" from the scohelp client will only close 
that particular help window.  If the window that was closed
was a primary help window for a client then subsequent help requests 
from that client will create a new primary help window, either by
using one of the other windows associated with the client or by
creating a new window if no others exist.
.sp
It is important to note that closing the last visible help window
will not actually cause the scohelp client to exit.  Scohelp will only exit when
the last client connected exits.
<H3>Topic Selection</H3>
This section describes what actually happens when the help server
receives a help request.
<P>
When the help server receives a request to open a hard-coded topic
name it checks
to see if an entry containing the hard-coded topic name exists
in the hook file.  If one does exist, it attempts to
open the topic that it maps to, otherwise it will attempt
to open the original topic directly.
<P>
Most SCO clients use widget tree sums instead of the hard-coded
topic names, but this scheme is for internal SCO use only, and is
not supported in this API, except that the sums are communicated to
the help server.
<CENTER>
<H2>Adding Help to an X Client</H2>
</CENTER>
The following sections provide the information necessary
to add help to a client.  It provides general background along
with the technical details about using the api.
<H3>The Motif helpCallback</H3>
The Motif helpCallback is the building block for providing help in 
most Motif clients.  Most help requests rely on this callback to some degree.
The helpCallback, if it exists, is automatically called by the 
Motif toolkit when the &lt;F1&gt; key is pressed over a widget.
Even if there is no helpCallback associated with the widget where 
the event occurred, Motif will automatically go up the widget hierarchy
until it either finds a widget that does have a helpCallback
or until the widget hierarchy is exhausted.
<P>
This feature of Motif means that the helpCallback only needs to be
added to certain key widgets.  For example, a helpCallback 
could be added to the parent of the set of widgets for which you wanted to 
provide a common help topic.   
<H3>Help Api</H3>
The help api provides a basic facility for sending help
requests to the help server.  It supports the use of both hard-coded
topic names and widget tree names, although widget tree
names are intended for SCO internal use only
(this api does not provide the facilities for building widget tree names).  
<P>
The three functions provided by this api are:
<PRE>
HelpStatus HelpOpen()	 Initalize data structures for communicating with server
HelpStatus HelpDisplay() Sends requests to the help server
HelpStatus HelpClose()	 Closes the help connection
</PRE>
<P>
This api is based on the help api that was originally part of Bookreader.
It requires very little effort to change over clients that used the 
previous Bookreader api.
<H4>Initialization</H4>
<PRE>
#include &lt;X11/scohelp/api.h&gt;

HelpStatus HelpOpen(client_context, toplevel, bookdir, 
                                  wait_cursor, error_handler)
XtPointer       *client_context;
Widget           toplevel;
char            *bookdir;
void            ((*wait_cursor)(Boolean));
void            ((*error_handler)(char *));
</PRE>
<B>
HelpOpen()
</B>
performs the initialization necessary for communicating with the help server.
It returns \fIhelpSuccess\fR on success and \fIhelpCreateClientFailure\fR
if the initialization fails.
<P>
Upon successful return from this function, the address specified by 
\fIclient_context\fR 
will point to an allocated and initialized structure containing information 
about the client.  The pointer to this structure is used in subsequent calls to
<B>
HelpDisplay()
</B>
and
<B>
HelpClose().  
</B>
The memory allocated for this structure is automatically free'd when
<B>
HelpClose()
</B>
is called by the client. 
Note that \fIclient_context\fR and the structure that it points to 
should not be modified by the client.
.sp
\fItoplevel\fR is the widget id of the calling application's toplevel
widget (after Xt initalization).
NOTE:  In earlier versions of the api it was required
that this widget be an always present, realized widget.  This is
no longer required.
.sp
\fIbookdir\fR is the name of the default book used by the client
(eg., XDeskHelp).  This value can be overriden in subsequent calls to 
<B>
HelpDisplay()
</B>
if the client needs to open multiple books.  
\fIbookdir\fR is assumed to be the name of a valid help book,
no checking is done by this routine.
The client's default help book should
ideally be specified via a resource named "helpBook" so that
there is a consistent way of specifying books across the clients.
<P>
The name specified by \fIbookdir\fR is actually the name of
a subdirectory where the topics contained in the client's help book
reside.  By default, this subdirectory resides on the clients machine
in /usr/lib/scohelp (although this can be overridden via the scohelp
docServer resource and/or by changing DocumentRoot on the server).  
For more information, see the section below, "Online Book Organization".
<P>
\fIwait_cursor\fR, if non-NULL, points to a function within the client that
is responsible for turning the wait cursor on and off.  The \fIwait_cursor\fR
routine is called with a value of TRUE when the client should display
a wait cursor (eg., when waiting for a response from the help server)
and FALSE when the client should display its default cursor.
<P>
\fIerror_handler\fR, if non-NULL, points to a function in the client responsible
for displaying error messages (typically in an error dialog box).
This routine will be called with a character string containing
the error message that should be displayed.  For example, if 
the help server is not installed this routine would be called
with a message indicating that the help server is not available.
<H4>Sending a Help Request</H4>
<PRE>
#include &lt;X11/scohelp/api.h&gt;

HelpStatus HelpDisplay(client_context, bookdir, obj_type, entry)
XtPointer        client_context;
char            *bookdir;
HelpObject       obj_type;
char            *entry;
</PRE>
<P>
<B>
HelpDisplay() 
</B>
sends a request to the help server indicating which topic should be displayed.
It would typically be called from a client's helpCallback. 
\fIhelpSuccess\fR is returned upon success, otherwise it returns one of:
\fIhelpBusy\fR, \fIhelpStartupFailure\fR, \fIhelpInvalidObject\fR, 
\fIhelpSendEventFailure\fR, or \fIhelpNoBookSpecified\fR indicating that
an error occurred while attempting to send a request.
<P>
\fIclient_context\fR points to the data structure initialized in the
call to 
<B>
HelpOpen().
</B>
Note that in this case the pointer to the structure is passed, not
the address of the pointer.  
<P>
\fIbookdir\fR, if non-NULL, specifies the name of the book to open.
If this value is NULL, then the default book specified in the call
to 
<B>
HelpOpen()
</B>
will be used.  If neither name is valid the function will return
\fIhelpNoBookSpecified\fR. 
<P>
\fIobj_type\fR specifies what type of request is being made.  Possible
values for this parameter include: \fIhelpTopic\fR for hard-coded
topic names and \fIhelpWidget\fR for widget tree names.  
<P>
\fIentry\fR is a null-terminated string specifying the topic to
be displayed.  If the request is for a hard-coded topic name,
as specified by the \fIobj_type\fR parameter, then this parameter
contains the literal string representing the topic name to display.
If the request is for a widget tree name, then this argument
contains the full pathname of the widget for which help is desired. 
Widget trees are for internal SCO use only.
<H4>Closing the Help Server Connection</H4>
<PRE>
#include &lt;X11/scohelp/api.h&gt;

HelpStatus HelpClose(client_context)
XtPointer        client_context;
</PRE>
<P>
<B>
HelpClose()
</B>
should be called when the client wants to close all of its associated
help windows, typically when the client exits.  
<P>
\fIclient_context\fR points to the data structure initialized in the
call to 
<B>
HelpOpen().
</B>
The space that was allocated for this structure in
<B>
HelpOpen()
</B>
is free'ed by this call.
Note that in this case the pointer to the structure in passed, not
the address of the pointer.  
<P>
<B>
HelpClose()
</B>
always returns \fIhelpSuccess\fR.

<H4>Warnings</H4>
This api is being provided to SCO customers with the understanding
that it or its underlying implementation may change in the future.
Client developers should understand that if this happens, it may
be necessary to rework their client to be compatible with future
versions of scohelp.
<P>
This api currently uses a property on the root window to prevent 
multiple invocations of the help server from occurring.  Although
this property is present only temporarily, if something out of
the ordinary happens (ie., the client or scohelp dies before the
help server comes up) this property may be left around and will
prevent the help server from ever starting.  If help requests are failing
silently, check for this property and remove it by using the xprop
command as follows:
<P>
To check for the existence of this property:
<P>
<PRE>
xprop -root | grep -y "lock"
</PRE>
<P>
To remove the property:
<P>
<PRE>
xprop -root -remove "_SCO_HELP_SERVER_LOCK for <host>"
</PRE>
<P>
where <host> will look something like "ohlone.sco.com"
<P>
If you see this problem, please notify SCO.

<H3>Availability</H3>
The api described in this section is currently part of the
<B>
libhelp.a
</B>
library.  It is available for SCO Development System customers as
a TLS and is also on Skunkworks.  This is not a published api, it
is subject to change, use at your own risk.
<CENTER>
<H2>Authoring Help Files</H2>
</CENTER>
This section describes how to author help files. 
It is primarily intended for authors responsible for writing online-help.
<H3>Online Book Organization</H3>
As was mentioned in an earlier section a \fBbook\fR in scohelp is 
just the name of a directory.  A \fBhelp topic\fR within a particular book 
is the name of a physical file in that book directory.  
<P>
The default location of all books is on the local machine in /usr/lib/scohelp.  
The docServer resource can be used to specify an alternative server.  
The server configuration files can set DocumentRoot to some other location
besides /usr/lib/scohelp (but all the documentation must be in the same 
directory).  The documentation can be viewed directly using scohelp in
Web Browser Mode.  The DocumentRoot is automatically inserted by the server.
For example, using the default location of the topic "UsingTheDesktop" 
in the book "XDeskHelp" could be viewed by executing Open URL and specifying:
<PRE>
http://localhost/XDeskHelp/UsingTheDesktop.html
</PRE>
on the localmachine the file can be found in
<PRE>
/usr/lib/scohelp/XDeskHelp/UsingTheDesktop.html
</PRE>
For more information on the documentation architecture, see the scohttp(ADM)
man page.
<H3>Hook Files</H3>
A hook file is an optional text file that provides
a facility for mapping hard-coded topic names to the 
actual names of topics in books.  It allows multiple
symbols to represent a single help topic.
<P>
If a hook file does exist, it must be located on the
client machine and in the directory specified by the
scohelp resource hookPath (by default /usr/lib/scohelp)
in a subdirectory with the same name as the book,
and the hookfile must have the same name as the
book plus a ".hk" extension (eg., "XDeskHelp.hk").
<H4>Hook File Syntax</H4>
Each line in a hook file is a separate entry.  The first field on
the line is the sum or topic name to be mapped.  The second field,
separated from the first by white space, is the name
of the actual topic (ie., file) to display.  This topic name cannot
contain white space. A comment line can be 
specified by starting a line with '!'.   Comments can also appear at the
end of entries, as long as they are preceded by white space.
A partial hook file might look as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
! XDeskHelp.hk

A1534898        UsingTheDesktop            SCO use only
</PRE>
<P>
Because the topic names specified in the second column are the name
of actual physical files, it is possible to use relative pathnames
in this field to specify topics that exist in other books.  It 
is also possible to use the "#" syntax supported in scohelp
cross references (HREF) to refer to a section in the middle
of a file.  
<P>
<B>Note
that only relative pathnames are supported, full pathnames should
