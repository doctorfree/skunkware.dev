<H1>New SCO Visual Tcl Reference Guide</H1>
<HR>
<H2>Improved SCO Visual Tcl Documentation</H2>
</CENTER>
A set of custom-installable documentation for SCO Visual Tcl
has been made available.  This documentation has been reorganized
to provide a more balanced and consistently-structured collection 
of the entire SCO Visual Tcl programming language.  Chapters
within this book (located under "Books" within the Operating System 
Documentation Set) include:
<UL>
<LI>
Chapter 1: Tcl - tool command language 
<LI>
Chapter 2: TclX - the Extended Tcl language 
<LI>
Chapter 3: SCO Visual Tcl - graphical scripting language 
<LI>
Chapter 4: Graphical commands 
<LI>
Chapter 5: Non-graphical commands 
</UL>
<CENTER>
<HR>
<H2>The Postscript Version</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
The reference guide has also been made available in postscript
format as tls581.ps.tar.Z.  This will be particularly useful
to Open Desktop 3.0 customers who will not be able to use the
new SCOHelp-based SCO Visual Tcl Reference Guide.
<CENTER>
<HR>
<H2>New Man Pages</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
Also included are two new man pages, TCLX and VTCL, located within the
Reference Documentation Set.

<CENTER>
<HR>
<H2>Early Availability Documentation</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
This new SCO Visual Tcl documentation should be
considered as <i>early availability documentation</i> which does
not meet final SCO documentation criteria. Specifically,
the SCO Visual Tcl Reference Guide does not include an
index at this time. Users are encouraged to use the
Table of Contents, online hot links, and full-text search
capabilities of ScoHelp to locate the information they need.
Please note that this new documentation does <b>not</b> overwrite
the existing SCO Visual Tcl SCO OpenServer Release 5 documentation.
