Included in this zipped file are blank icons and seamless background pattern tiles for use on web pages. Get creative: add your own text or pictures to personalize the icons.

These icons were created with Photoshop by Laurie McCanna. If you decide that you like these icons and want to use them on your website, I'd appreciate a link back to my website in return. You can either link to the Web Diner Website at http://www.webdiner.com, or my personal website at http://www.mccannas.com

You may be familiar with http://www.mccannas.com as a great place to pick up
