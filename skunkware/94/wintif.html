Motif applications can be recompiled and relinked with the header
files and library provided on Skunkware. Assuming the Skunkware CD-ROM
is mounted on /usr/skunk, recompile with the <B>-I/usr/skunk/include</B>
compiler option and relink with the Wintif library 
<B>/usr/skunk/lib/libWXm.a</B>.
<P>
Applications relinked in this manner will only execute on systems with a 
valid Motif license.
<P>
By default, <B>IXI Wintif 1.0</B> displays using the Microsoft windows 3.1
look-and-feel.  However, if you wish to do so, you can switch to the 
Motif look.  This can be done in two ways:
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>
By setting the resource "lookAndFeel" to "Motif".  
<BR>
For example:
<UL>
<LI>
When you start an application, add the following command-line argument:
<BR>
			-xrm "*lookAndFeel: Motif"

<LI>
In a resource file, add the line:
<BR>
			*lookAndFeel: Motif

<LE>
</UL>
<LI>
By setting the environment variable "WINTIF_LOOKANDFEEL" to "Motif".
<LE>
</UL>
<BR>
If both the environment variable and the resource are set, the environment
variable will take precedence.
