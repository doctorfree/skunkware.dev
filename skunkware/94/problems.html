The most serious known problems and limitations with SCO Skunkware 5 include :

<IMG SRC="/skunkware/pics/gif/buttons/ball.green.gif" ALT="+">
Xmcd & IDE CD-ROM Drives
<DD>SCO OpenServer Release 5 contains support for IDE CD-ROM drives. However,
xmcd 1.4 supports only SCSI and SUN/Linux IDE CD-ROM drives. Fortunately, on
SCO OpenServer 5 an IDE CD-ROM looks like a SCSI CD-ROM to the system. If you
have an IDE CD-ROM which you would like to configure for use with xmcd, you
can select "Other" from the list of supported drives and accept the default
settings. This mostly works. An upgraded version of xmcd with SCO IDE CD-ROM
support should be available soon.

Performance
<DD>The access times on the High-Sierra Rockridge CD-ROM are (subjectively)
slow. If you find that you are using a component frequently, it may be
worth your while to copy the relevant files over to a hard disk filesystem.
See the section on Installation in Limitations below.
<P>
<DT>
<IMG SRC="/skunkware/pics/gif/buttons/ball.green.gif" ALT="+">
MIME
<DD>If you have created a personal $HOME/.mailcap you may need to modify
it in order to take advantage of the multimedia tools available on SCO
Skunkware 5. For instance, AVI files can be played with 
/usr/skunk/bin/X11/xanim. A Skunkware system mailcap file is available in
/usr/skunk/lib/mosaic/mailcap.
<P>
<DT>
<IMG SRC="/skunkware/pics/gif/buttons/ball.green.gif" ALT="+">
Mail
<DD>One user reported that after he added /usr/skunk/bin/X11/xanim to
his $HOME/.mailcap file that mail would inexplicably pause between messages
while the CD-ROM was accessed. This was not reproducable. If you experience
excessive delays between mail messages you may want to selectively remove
Skunkware components from your $HOME/.mailcap if one exists.
<P>
<DT>
<IMG SRC="/skunkware/pics/gif/buttons/ball.green.gif" ALT="+">
Custom
<DD>When using the SCO custom utility to remove the SKUNK package, the
VTCLRefGuide subpackage gets an error complaining about
"awk: can't open source  awk"
<P>
<DT>
<IMG SRC="/skunkware/pics/gif/buttons/ball.green.gif" ALT="+">
Installation
<DD>Some binaries have <I>/usr/skunk</I> compiled in as the path to support 
files. If you choose to install one or more of these on your hard disk, you
may need to patch the binary. The
<A HREF="/skunkware/95/src/Tools/bpatch/ReadMe.html">bpatch</A> utility is
useful for this. Some of these, notably the GNU development system, are
<A HREF="custom.html">custom installable</A>.
<P>
<DT>
<IMG SRC="/skunkware/pics/gif/buttons/ball.green.gif" ALT="+">
GNU Debugger
<DD>The GNU debugger, gdb, is out-of-date. A new revision will be made
available via an <A HREF="updates.html">SCO Skunkware Update</A>.
<P>
<DT>
<IMG SRC="/skunkware/pics/gif/buttons/ball.green.gif" ALT="+">
GNU libg++
<DD>The GNU C++ library, libg++, is out-of-date. A new revision will be made
available via an <A HREF="updates.html">SCO Skunkware Update</A>.
For this reason, most of the C++ builds in SCO Skunkware 5 use the SCO C++
compiler, CC.
<P>
<DT>
<IMG SRC="/skunkware/pics/gif/buttons/ball.green.gif" ALT="+">
Emacs
<DD>The version of emacs, 19.22, is out-of-date. A new revision will be made
available via an <A HREF="updates.html">SCO Skunkware Update</A>.
<P>
<DT>
<IMG SRC="/skunkware/pics/gif/buttons/ball.green.gif" ALT="+">
HP-UX Visual Tcl
<DD>An improved port of IXI Visual Tcl for HP-UX will be made
available via an <A HREF="updates.html">SCO Skunkware Update</A>.
<P>
<DT>
<IMG SRC="/skunkware/pics/gif/buttons/ball.green.gif" ALT="+">
Mounting on ODT 3.0
<DD>The Rockridge extensions to the High-Sierra filesystem format are not
supported under SCO ODT 3.0. In order to mount the SCO Skunkware 5 CD-ROM
on an ODT 3.0 system, use the command :
<PRE>
	# mount -r -f HS,lower /dev/cd0 /usr/skunk
</PRE>
All filenames will be mapped to lower case and truncated to a maximum of
8 characters with a 3 character suffix (i.e. 8.3 file naming as in MS-DOS).
Although the ELF binary format and use of DLL's prevents execution on ODT 3.0
systems, you will still be able to read and copy files to your system (e.g.
you may want to apply one or more of the Technical Level Supplements in 
/usr/skunk/tls to your ODT 3.0 system).
<P>
<DT>
<IMG SRC="/skunkware/pics/gif/buttons/ball.green.gif" ALT="+">
Extracting Source Archives on ODT 3.0
<DD> Under SCO UNIX 3.2v4 it may be necessary to use pax rather than tar to
extract the compressed source archives. That is, rather than the command :
<PRE>
        # gzcat filename.tar.gz | tar xf -
</PRE>
it may be necessary to use the command :
<PRE>
        # gzcat filename.tar.gz | pax  -rmopLvf -
</PRE>
<P>
<DT>
<IMG SRC="/skunkware/pics/gif/buttons/ball.green.gif" ALT="+">
Microsoft Windows 3.x, Windows NT and Windows 95
<DD> SCO Skunkware 5 is readable on systems running Microsoft Windows 3.x,
Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT and Windows 95.
The filenames may be truncated and the case mapped. However, you can view
the GIF images and play many of the animations (if you have the appropriate
applications installed). To do so, simply use the File Manager or Windows
Explorer to view the contents of the /pics/gif and /pics/anim directories.
Double-click on one of the files in the subdirectories there 
(e.g.  /pics/anim/avi/OpenCity.avi).
<P>
Unfortunately most (all ?) Windows WWW browsers do not, as yet, understand 
relative URL's. This, among other things, makes it difficult to browse the 
SCO Skunkware 5 CD-ROM when on a Windows platform.  You can browse to the 
extent that your browser will let you "Open File", select the CD-ROM 
drive, double-click your way down to the lib/x11/mosaic directory and then 
double-click an HTML document (e.g. index.html).
<P>
Alternatively, if you have internet access from your Windows system, you can
browse the SCO Skunkware 5 contents by pointing your browser at the URL
<A HREF="http://www.sco.com/SkunkWare/">http://www.sco.com/SkunkWare/</A>

Microsoft Windows 95
<DD> On at least one system with the June 95 Pre-release of Microsoft Windows
95, the SCO Skunkware 5 CD-ROM was unreadable. After attempting to read the
Skunkware CD-ROM, no other CD-ROM could be read until after rebooting Windows.
This problem was due to Windows 95 mis-identifying the CD-ROM drive as a 4X
rather than 3X drive. If you should encounter a similar problem
(i.e. no files or directories appear in the Windows Explorer when you click 
on the CD-ROM drive containing SCO Skunkware 5), you may need to configure
your CD-ROM drive settings and reboot your system in order to restore the 
CD-ROM drive to a useable state.
<P>
<DT>
<IMG SRC="/skunkware/pics/gif/buttons/ball.green.gif" ALT="+">
Mounting SCO Skunkware 2.0
<DD>Both SCO Skunkware 5 and SCO Skunkware 2.0 use /usr/skunk as their
default mount point. It is not possible to mount and run both of these
CD-ROM's simultaneously without some modification to the symbolic links
created by the SCO Skunkware installation script /usr/skunk/bin/spray.
If you would like to mount and run both of these CD-ROM's simultaneously,
one will need to be mounted on an alternate mount-point (e.g. /usr/skunk2).
The appropriate symbolic links in /usr/local and /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults
and elsewhere will need to be created by hand.
<P>
<DT>
<IMG SRC="/skunkware/pics/gif/buttons/ball.green.gif" ALT="+">
Running /usr/skunk/bin/spray on a Localized OpenServer 5 System
<DD> On some localized systems, the id command when run as root returns
a foreign language equivalent to root. The spray script verifies that it
is being run by the root user by parsing the string returned by the id command.
If you are running on a localized system on which the id command returns
something other than "uid=0(root)" as the first field, then you will need
to modify the spray script as follows :
<PRE>
        # cp /usr/skunk/bin/spray /tmp/spray
        # vi /tmp/spray
</PRE>
Comment out the lines 
<PRE>
fuid=`id`
uid=`echo $fuid | awk ' { print $1 } '`
[ "$uid" = "uid=0(root)" ] || {
        echo "You must have root priveleges to run spray."
        usage
        exit 1
}
</PRE>
And then run the command "/tmp/spray" as the root user.

Unknown Problems
<DD> SCO Skunkware 5 is the first release of Skunkware designed specifically
for SCO OpenServer Release 5. As such, there may be programs which do not
function correctly or which exhibit previously undiscovered problems. Please
feel free to assist us in finding and fixing all such problems. SCO Skunkware 5
includes source to most of the programs allowing the user to fix and recompile
when problems arise. Please return any such improvements to rr@ronrecord.com for
inclusion in subsequent releases.
