Ok, i'm going to try and assemble this off the top of my head so you know
i'm going to forget or overlook lots of people. Look at this as phase 0
in assembling a list of SCO Skunkware contributors and supporters. We'll
improve it over time. Please e-mail rr@ronrecord.com with additions/deletions and
corrections. Now to get started...

SCO Skunkware 5 contains software developed and contributed by hundreds

these useful and/or entertaining programs and especially for placing them
in the public domain or otherwise making them available for free redistribution.
For the specifics of who these people are, please see the individual README's
in the source tree and/or examine the code.

If an SCO Skunkware 5 component does not appear in the list above, then
it's a pretty good guess that either Larry Philps or Tom Kelly or myself
(Ron Record) ported and contributed it. Or it could be that i forgot to
give credit to someone (almost surely). At any rate, please forgive and
correct my omissions and errors.

Outside SCO there are also a number of SCO Skunkware contributors. The 
various ftp and www sites that make available or mirror sources are all
to be profusely thanked and supported. This year, <B>Robert Lipe</B>
deserves special mention for his diligent efforts in getting us the latest
and greatest SCO OpenServer 5 ports of the GNU development system tools.
Thanks Robert! In addition to Robert, other non-SCO folks that deserve
acknowledgement include <B>Paul Fischer</B> at Open Age Inc. for his several
contributions and <B>Craig Larson</B> for the video production and 
coordination of the super-cool 
<A HREF="/skunkware/pics/anim/avi/OpenServer.avi">

<A HREF="/skunkware/pics/anim/avi/OpenCity.avi">
OpenCity 5 </A> and
