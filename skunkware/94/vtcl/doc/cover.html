Special <i>SCOForum 94</i> Distribution
</h2>
SCO is pioneering the trend in graphical scripting languages with its
Motif-based technology called "<b>SCO Visual Tcl</b>."
Because this technology is based on the powerful public domain scripting
language called "Tcl," the power of this new GUI-building environment
goes way beyond simple "Motif-wrapper" technologies. 
<p>
SCO is implementing
its next generation systems management environment, leveraging exclusively
on Visual Tcl for both its Motif and Character look & feel.
And thanks to a simple, yet versatile scripting interface, Visual Tcl
will also make Motif available to system administrators as well as graphical 
tool developers.
<h2>
<img src=bullet.gif align = middle> New Visual Tcl Man Pages
</h2>
Select <A href=VisualTcl.man.html>vtcl(TCL)</A> man page
to view the Motif-specific Visual Tcl command set, as well as information
describing the general architecture of the SCO Visual Tcl environment.
<p>
At this point in the development cycle, the man pages for the
base Tcl command set are not complete.  However, Tcl does provide
a built-in on-line help mechanism.
To use this help mechanism until there is a full man page set,
do the following...
<p>
At your Unix shell prompt, type 
<br>
<kbd>
vtcl
</kbd>
<br>
vtcl&gt
<kbd>
help tcl
</kbd>
<p>
This will show you the categories of on-line help, such as
<i>variables</i>, <i>strings</i> and <i>processes</i>.
For example, to view help on file input/output commands, type:
<br>
<kbd>
vtcl
</kbd>
<br>
vtcl&gt
<kbd>
help tcl/files
</kbd>

<h2>
<img src=bullet.gif align = middle> Visual Tcl NewsGroup Coming! 
</h2>
SCO Visual Tcl discussions take place on a newsgroup called
<b>biz.sco.wserver</b>. SCO will support your questions and issues
(as best we can) on this newsgroup. We anticipate that this group will 
be renamed <b>biz.sco.vtcl</b>.
<h2>
<img src=bullet.gif align = middle> Caveats/Things you should know
</h2>
<ul>
<li>We reserve the right to change anything!
<p>
However, keep in mind that a huge amount of Visual Tcl code has been 
generated in-house at SCO and it is extremely unlikely that there are
to be significant changes that would adversely affect the scripts you
develop.
<p>
<li>Context-Sensitive Help
<p>
SCO Visual Tcl will support context-sensitve help in the final release.
This version does not currently support on-line help.
<p>
<li>Postscript Help Document
<p>
The SCO Visual Tcl manual pages are also available as a postscript document
called <A href=VisualTcl.man.ps><B>VisualTcl.man.ps</B></A>
located in <B>/usr/skunk/lib/vtcl/doc</B>.
</ul>
