<DD>
NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System is a networked
information discovery, retrieval, and collaboration
tool and World Wide Web browser developed at the
National Center for Supercomputing Applications as a
part of NCSA's Mosaic project.  
<P>
This version of Mosaic 2.4 has patches added that make it work with
the "Term" program also contributed by Tom Kelly.  With Term and
Mosaic, you can use Mosaic from home, over a modem with pretty good
performance!
<P>
To use it with term, you first need to be running term on your
computer at home.
See the man page for term for information on how to set that up.
Then use the -term option to Mosaic to request that it use
a term connection instead of TCP/IP.
<P>
Be sure to read in the term man page about the environment variable
TERM_BORROWED_DISPLAY_NUMBER, and to set it the same way when
you invoke the term server and Mosaic -term.
<P>
Note that connection attempts cannot be aborted when using
Mosaic -term.
If the remote site does not respond, your term session will
hang until it times out.
<P>
This version of Mosaic 2.4 has also been compiled with support for
direct access to WAIS servers.  It is no longer necessary to rely on
an intermediate WAIS gateway to service such requests.  To convert a
URL which uses a WAIS gateway to one which accesses the WAIS server
directly, replace the gateway specification with "wais://".  For
example, "http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8001/cmns-moon.think.com/WWP?"
becomes "wais://cmns-moon.think.com/WWP?"
