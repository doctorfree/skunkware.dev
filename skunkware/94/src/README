Hi,

All of the SCO Skunkware 2.0 source directories have been archived and 
compressed in order to faciliate easier/faster downloading. A side effect
of this is that the various README's and man pages are no longer individually
accessible. In some cases, the corresponding SCO Skunkware 5 component tree
will suffice. If you really need to view one of the README's for a particular
utility/game/client, then download the gzip'd tar file of that directory and
extract it locally. Please feel free to send comments to rr@sco.com.
