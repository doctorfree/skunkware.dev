Included in this zipped file are blank icons and seamless background pattern 
tilesfor use on web pages. Get creative: add your own text or pictures to 
personalize the icons.

These icons were created with Photoshop by Laurie McCanna. If you decide that 
you like these icons and want to use them on your website, I'd appreciate a 
link back to my website in return. You can either link to the Web Diner Website
at http://www.webdiner.com, or my personal website at http://www.mccannas.com
