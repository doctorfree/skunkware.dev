This directory hierarchy contains images in the form of GIF files,
mpeg animation files, SAV files generated by the lyap, julia and mandel
X clients, and other interesting visual stuff. Here's a brief description :

./anim - contains files suitable for viewing with mpeg_play
./gif - contains subdirectories with files suitable for viewing with 
		any GIF viewer (e.g. xv)
./xwd - contains an X Window Dump of scientific visualization created at
		the USC Neuroscience Program using SCO software. To view, use the
		xwud program in /usr/bin/X11 (e.g. "xwud -in xwd/*" ).
./julia*, ./lyap*, ./mandel* - contain SAV files generated by julia, lyap,
		and mandel respectively. These can be viewed and the calculation
		restarted by using the "-i filename" option to the appropriate
		program (e.g. "lyap -i lyap/bigbug.sav").

All of the images in gif/endo, gif/hop, gif/julia, gif/lyap, gif/spore,
gif/xtopo, anim, julia*, lyap*, and mandel* were created by Ronald Joe Record 
(rr@sco.com). Redistribution or sale of these images without the express 
written permission of Ronald Joe Record is forbidden.
