This is the binary distribution of XForms, a graphical user interface
toolkit for X Window Systems. It should work under X11 R4, R5 & R6.

Shared library may or may not be provided. If it is not,
that means your platform probably does not support it or (more likely)
I don't know how to make it.

Depending on platforms and ld, you probably will have to move
the shared library out of FORMS/ to make the demos, or set
LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or LD_RUN_PATH on OpenBSD/pmax) to include FORMS/

Some of the demos won't compile without the xpm library. You can
get it from

Mesa/OpenGL users: on some platforms, the mesa support is in
the static library, but may not be in the shared library. If you
would like to add it to the shared libary, you can do so
by compiling FORMS/gl.c and put it in the shared library.

NOTE: On SGI, the OpenGL support (gl.o, that is) was compiled using
      the real thing. One other platforms, it was compiled
      using mesa. If your platform is not sgi and you have
      real OpenGL, you *must* remove gl.o from the library
      and re-compile FORMS/gl.c using the real OpenGL headers.



-----------
All changes should be made to mkconfig.h and they will propagate
to other makefiles.


DEMOS/  contains a menu driven demo/test suite. Type make to generate
        all the executables. program DEMOS/demo is the master driver.
        (only if "current directory" . is on your path).

        If you're using the shared lib, you don't need to have
        -lXpm to compile as it is stuffed inside the shared lib.

        If you're using static lib, some of the demos won't link
        without -lXpm

FORMS/  contains the library and necessary headers, which can be
        installed by typing make install.

        gl.c and mesa.c are sample implementations of specialized
        canvases.

DESIGN/ contains a GUI builder that helps you design interaction
        dialogs interactively and write the form generation C code.
