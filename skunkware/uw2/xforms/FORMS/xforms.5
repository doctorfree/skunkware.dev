.SH SYNOPSIS
xforms is a GUI toolkit and builder for the X Window Systems and
runs on all major UNIX platforms as well as OpenVMS and OS2. 
.B Forms Library
is too complex to be described in the "man" page format. 
Ask your system administrator for the location of the PostScript
document or follow the links on the
.BR "Forms Library" 's
home page for an html or PostScript version of the document.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Forms Library
is a graphical user interface toolkit based on Xlib for X Window
Systems. It comes with a rich set of objects such as buttons,
browsers, sliders and menus integrated into an elegant event/object
callback execution model that allows fast and easy construction
of X applications. The library consists of a flexible set of
C-routines that can be used in C and C++ programs (As of this
writing, perl, ada95, Fortran and python bindings to the
.B Forms Library
are in beta.)

The library is efficient and portable and runs on all major
Unix platforms, including Sun, SGI, HP, 
DEC Alpha/OSF, IBM RS6000, Convex, Cray, 
Linux(i386, alpha, m68k, sparc), 
FreeBSD, NetBSD(i386, m68km, sparc), SCO, Unixware,  
OpenBSD (i386, pmax), DGUX (m88k), BSDi,
DecSystem(mips)/Ultrix and others.
Non-unix platforms include OpenVMS and OS/2.

Bundled with the library is also a Form designer,
.I fdesign,
which can be used to build interaction forms in a WYSIWYG
(what you see is what you get) way and to generate the corresponding
C (or any of the binding languages) code for you.
50+ demos in source code are distributed with the library.
.SH OPTIONS
All programs written using the
.B Forms Library
recognize the following command line options
.TP 6
.BI \-display " host:dpy"
specifies the server to connect to.
.TP
.BI \-bw " borderwidth"
specifies the border width to use for built-in objects. 
.TP
.BI \-visual " visualName"
requests a visual by name such as TrueColor etc. By default the
.B Forms Library
always selects the visual that has the most depth.
.TP
.BI \-depth " depth"
requests a specific depth.
.TP
.BI \-debug " level"
generates some info about the state of the
.B XForms. 
where 
.I level
is an integer between 1-5 and controls the amount of
information to output. Depending on the options used
when the
.B Forms Library
was built, a level more than 3 might not be available.
.TP
.B \-sync
runs the application in synchronous mode with debug level set to 4. 
.TP
.B \-private
requests a private colormap for the application.
.TP
.B \-shared
requests a shared colormap even if the application needs more
colors than available. For those colors that can't be allocated
in the shared colormap, substitutions are made so the closest
matching color is used.
.TP
.B \-stdcmap
requests a standard colormap.
.TP
.B \-name " newname"
specifies the application name under which resources are to be
obtained, rather than the default executable file name.
