Incompatibilities (I apologize for the incompatibilities, but
it is for the better)

-----------------

     fl_show_question(char *s1, char *s2, char *s3) 
  changed to
     fl_show_question(char *s, int def_answer)

        -1 no preference.

Enhancements and Fixes
-------------------
o. fdesign
     Better response
     Interaction change. Left mouse button can be used to
     add, move and resize objects.
     Object class specific initializations for some objects.
     External binding hooks.
     Undo for Align operation.
     Make backups of old output

o. xyplot
     added fl_set_xyplot_[x|y]grid       - adds grid lines to an xyplot
           fl_set_xyplot_alpha[x|y]tics  - alphanumerical tic labels
           fl_set_xyplot_fixed_[x|y]axis - constant plotting area
           fl_clear_xyplot               - free dynamic mem related to xyplot

     allows inverted axes
     deprecated fl_set_xyplot_font[style|size]. 
     Use fl_set_object_l[size|style]. This allows setting the
     font from within fdesign.  

     fixed xyplot overlay so it gets plotted immediately.
     fixed active plot in the presence of overlays.
     better tics generation

o. Browser
    Added horizontal scrollbars.
    Better, more solid look&feel scrollbars
    Added fl_addto_browser_chars  - append chars (with or without newline)

       or one line (any other mouse buttons).

o. file selector
    o. general speedup
    o. added fl_set_dirlist_sort and different sorting methods for
       directory entries 
    o. show the default selection
    o. added atclose handler.

o. Timer
    Count-up timer.
    Suspend and resume.
    Filter for timer output (so you can present the time in whatever
    format you like).
    slightly better accuracy

o. Goodies:
    fl_show_input now has two extra buttons: Clear and Cancel.
    The original input goodie is re-named as fl_show_simple_input
    Note that the old show_input never returns null, the
    new show_input could if cancel is pressed
    Fixed alert goodie text overstrike problem

o. Buttons
   Added FL_ROUND3DBUTTON class
   Changed fl_set_button so it takes care of unsetting other related
   radio buttons.

   more and better index entries.
   better (I think) explanation on non-blocking interaction.

o. pixmap buttons
    added fl_set_pixmapbutton_focus_outline to disable the focus outline

o. General
   Better link profile
   Provided means to override FL_UNFOCUS event
   Fixed a color substitution problem
   Added FL_INVISIBLE_CURSOR constant
   Enhanced robustness of some of the macros
   fl_deactivate_object works for canvas
   documented some previously undocumented functions.
   Added to FL_FORMS structure a new member fdui that gets
   set to the FD_ structure by fdesign.
   fl_set_font_name returns int, <0 indicates bad font.
   Fixed some free memory reference problem
   fl_initialize now strips everything after the last period from the argv[0]
    to make the command name. Not sure 100% correct, but at least
    it will cut down "bug reports" about command line option not 
    working with a.out.
   Added fl_ringbell() function
   Added fl_mouse_button() function that can be called from
    all object callback funcitons to obtain the mouse button number
   Changed BOLDITALIC font from default width to normal. 
   Looks much better on SGI and should be the same on most other platforms.
   To revert to the old font, use
   fl_set_font_name(FL_BOLDITALIC_STYLE,
                    "-*-helvetica-bold-o-*-*-*-?-*-*-p-*-*-*", 
   reduced fl_check_forms busy wait cpu usage somewhat 

Major items on the to-do-list (not necessarily in priority order)
-----------------------
menu bar
scrolled canvas
image canvas
extend and enhance fdesign (managing project)
more flexibility & freedom for popups
line buttons on browser (trivial to do, but does not look right)
tabbed folders
