Can I make money giving software away ?


Create a market position 
For proprietary software
For training, services and support
Free "widget" drivers can help sell widgets
Sell accessories (e.g. books, training) 
Sell the current revision, older revs are free
Sell content, not software (e.g. subscriptions)
Market brand rather than code
