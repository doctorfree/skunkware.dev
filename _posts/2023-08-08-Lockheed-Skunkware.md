## Background

The term 'Skunk Works' originated during World War II when the P-80 Shooting
Star was designed by Lockheed's Advanced Development Projects Division in
Burbank, California. A closely guarded incubator was set up in a circus tent
next to a plastics factory in Burbank. The strong smells that wafted into the
tent made the Lockheed R&amp;D workers think of the foul-smelling 'Skonk Works'
factory in Al Capp's Li'l Abner comic strip.

Skunk Works history started with the P-38 Lightning in 1939 and the P-80
Shooting Star in 1943. Skunk Works engineers subsequently developed the U-2,
SR-71 Blackbird, F-117 Nighthawk, F-22 Raptor, and F-35 Lightning II, the
latter being used in the air forces of several countries.

In the early 90's SCO began releasing 'SCO Skunkware', a collection of open
source software ported and packaged for installation and use on SCO platforms.

## Lockheed Suits

In the mid-90s Lockheed began suing anyone and everyone who used the term
'skunk' in a product. They were successful and many products, most unrelated
in any fashion to aircraft or anything produced by Lockheed, were forced to
change their product names. Lockheed even sued Network Solutions in an
attempt to make it illegal for Internet Domain registrars to sell domain
names with the term 'skunk' in them. They lost that suit so now we have
[skunkware.dev](https://skunkware.dev)!

That's trademark law protecting your rights.

## Lockheed Sues SCO

In 1996 Lockheed sued SCO claiming that use of the term 'SCO Skunkware'
was an infringement on their 'Skunk Works' trademark. SCO and Lockheed
settled out of court with the agreement that SCO could continue to use
'SCO Skunkware' but only if every mention of 'SCO Skunkware' was
accompanied by the statement:

***The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc. and SCO Skunkware are not related to,
affiliated with or licensed by the famous Lockheed Martin Skunk Works (R),
the creator of the F-117 Stealth Fighter, SR-71, U-2, Venturestar(tm),
Darkstar(tm), and other pioneering air and spacecraft.***

## SCO Skunkware Website

As the maintainer of the SCO Skunkware website, I was told to add the
above statement everywhere 'SCO Skunkware' was referenced. I was
delighted to do so. However, there were hundreds if not thousands
of SCO Skunkware web pages and almost all of them included the
offensive term. I worked hard and got the job done.

I went about my business, not thinking much about it. Then one day
I happened to search for "Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird" in one of the
many Internet search engines we had back then. What I got as the
first few dozen hits returned from my search were all SCO Skunkware
web pages. Haha!

Lockheed was hoist on its own petard. Their insistence on 'owning'
the work 'skunk' had resulted in burying any mention of their
famous works under pages and pages of SCO Skunkware links.

Yes, Mary, there is justice in this world.
