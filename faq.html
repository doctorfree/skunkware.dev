<B><A NAME="q0a">What is SCO Skunkware?</A></B>
<P>
SCO Skunkware is a collection of useful and
entertaining software for use on SCO platforms.
The CD-ROM contains many public domain or freely distributable
programs including the GNU C Compiler, GNU
utilities, audio drivers, Technical Library
Supplements, graphics libraries, games, audio
and video tools, graphics utilities, and much
much more.
<P>
There is a <A HREF="/skunkware/intro/">slide presentation</A> on Skunkware,
it's history, contents, etc which Ronald Joe Record presented at
<A HREF="http://www.sco.com/forum98/conference/grid.html">SCO Forum 98</A>
<P>
The <A HREF="/skunkware">current release of SCO Skunkware</A> 
is intended for use on SCO OpenServer and SCO UnixWare. 
<A HREF="http://www.sco.com/skunkprev/index.html">
Previous releases of SCO Skunkware </A>
provided tools ported to SCO ODT, SCO UNIX 3.2v4, and even SCO Xenix.
<P>
<A HREF="#top"> [top]</A>
<HR>
<P>
<B><A NAME="q0">How do I order the SCO Skunkware CD-ROM?</A></B>
<P>
The currently shipping SCO Skunkware CD-ROM may be ordered from
<A HREF="http://www.sco.com/offers">
our on-line ordering system</A> which has been updated to include
SCO Skunkware 98. There is no additional media, shipping or handling charge 
for SCO Skunkware when ordered in conjunction with any of the other
SCO "free" product offerings.
<P>
Previous releases of SCO Skunkware are no longer available on CD-ROM,
but may be downloaded from our
 <A HREF="http://www.sco.com/skunkprev/index.html">
previous release web/ftp site</A>. 
<P>
<A HREF="#top"> [top]</A>
<HR>
<P>
<B><A NAME="q1">How do I locate a particular SCO Skunkware component?</A></B>
<P>
To download a particular component you first have to locate the download
directory for that component. The SCO Skunkware team has tried to provide
intuitive categories of components. For instance, if you were looking for
Vim, the improved visual text editor, you could click on
<A HREF=/skunkware/editors/index.html>Editors</A> from the
<A HREF=/skunkware/index.html>Category Selection</A> page. 
<P>
Similarly, the SCO Skunkware ftp hierarchy has been organized by functional
category within operating system platform. For instance, to find the SCO
OpenServer "vim" distribution via ftp, you would establish an anonymous
ftp connection to <A HREF="ftp://ftp.sco.com">ftp.sco.com</A> and look in
the directory <A HREF="ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/osr5/editors/">
/skunkware/osr5/editors</A>. There you would find a subdirectory called vim.
To locate the SCO UnixWare vim distribution, you would look in the directory
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/uw2/editors/">
/skunkware/uw2/editors</A>.
<P>
You can also locate a Skunkware component by
<A HREF="http://search.sco.com/">searching the HTML documents
on www.sco.com</A>.
<P>
<A HREF="#top"> [top]</A>
<HR>
<P>
<B><A NAME="q2">How do I download "xyz" for SCO OpenServer?</A></B>
<P>
Make sure to download files in binary mode when using ftp.
To download with your web browser, simply hold the shift key down while
clicking on the desired file. The OpenServer Skunkware distribution is
available via http and ftp at either :
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://skunkware.ddns.net/skunkware/osr5/">

<LI><A HREF="ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/osr5/">
ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/osr5</A>
</UL>
<P>
After locating a component's download directory (see
<A HREF="#q1">the previous answer</A>), the typical OpenServer Skunkware
distribution will contain several files. These include :
<DL>
<DT>Media images installable with the SCO Software Manager (custom)
<DD>This is the file "VOLS.tar", a tar archive of custom installable media
images. This is the preferred and recommended downloadable and installable
component format. 
<DT>A gzip'd tar or cpio archive
<DD>This file is typically named component-release.tar.gz or
component-release.cpio.gz where "component-release" stands for the name
and release of the component (e.g. vim-4.6). This is an alternate distribution
format which is intended for those people who dislike using the SCO
Software Manager (custom) or for components which have not yet been packaged
for use with custom.
<P>
This file contains a binary distribution which can be extracted by hand
as the root user from / on the target system. If a VOLS.tar file exists
for this component, it is recommended to download that and install using
custom.
<DT>Source for the component
<DD>There should always be a gzip'd tar archive of the source used to
build a particular Skunkware component as well as a pointer back to
the original source (often they are identical). This source archive is
usually stored in the "src" subdirectory of the download directory for
a component. For instance, the source to vim is in the directory
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/osr5/editors/vim/src/">
/skunkware/osr5/editors/vim/src</A>. This directory (and the one at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/uw2/editors/vim/src/">
/skunkware/uw2/editors/vim/src</A>) is a symbolic link to the single source
directory that contains the source archives for all platforms. For instance,
the vim source is actually located at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/src/editors/vim/">
/skunkware/src/editors/vim</A>) and is linked into the osr5 and uw2 trees.

<P>
After locating a component's download directory (see
<A HREF="#q1">the previous answer</A>), the typical UnixWare Skunkware
distribution will contain several files. These include :
<DL>
<DT>A "package" file installable with the pkgadd facility on UnixWare
<DD>This is the file "component.pkg", where "component" stands for the
name of the Skunkware component (e.g. vim.pkg).
This is the preferred and recommended downloadable and installable
component format. 
<DT>A gzip'd tar or cpio archive
<DD>This file is typically named component-release.tar.gz or
component-release.cpio.gz where "component-release" stands for the name
and release of the component (e.g. vim-4.6). This is an alternate distribution

<A NAME="q4">How do I install the VOLS.tar media images on OpenServer?</A></B>
<P>
After downloading the component's VOLS.tar file (see
<A HREF="#q2">the previous answer</A>), login to your system as the
root user, extract the VOLS.tar archive into an empty directory
(say, for example, the directory /tmp/foobar) and run the "custom" command.
Select the menu items "Software" -> "Install New". Select your host and,
when prompted for the Media Device, select "Media Images" and "Continue".
When prompted for the Image Directory, type in "/tmp/foobar or whatever
is the name of the directory containing the extracted VOLS.tar media images.
Select Ok and proceed.

For SCO OpenServer 5, download either
<BR>
<A HREF="http://skunkware.ddns.net/skunkware/osr5/shellutil/gzip/gzip-1.2.4-VOLS.tar">
http://skunkware.ddns.net/skunkware/osr5/shellutil/gzip/gzip-1.2.4-VOLS.tar</A>

ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/osr5/shellutil/gzip/gzip-1.2.4-VOLS.tar</A>
<P>
These are custom installable media images. To install, extract the
tar archive into an empty directory somewhere (say /tmp/gzip) and run
<PRE>
    # custom -p SKUNK98:GZIP -i -z /tmp/gzip
</PRE>
This will place gzip/gzcat et al in /usr/local/bin
<P>
For UnixWare 7, download either
<BR>
<A HREF="http://skunkware.ddns.net/skunkware/uw7/shellutil/gzip/gzip.pkg">
http://skunkware.ddns.net/skunkware/uw7/shellutil/gzip/gzip.pkg</A>

ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/uw7/shellutil/gzip/gzip.pkg</A>
<P>
This is a pkgadd installable data stream. Install by running
<PRE>
    # pkgadd -d /path/to/gzip.pkg
</PRE>

Again, this will get you binaries in /usr/local/bin
<P>
For UnixWare 2.x, download either
<BR>
<A HREF="http://skunkware.ddns.net/skunkware/uw2/shellutil/gzip/gzip.pkg">

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/uw2/shellutil/gzip/gzip.pkg">

<P>
Install as above.
<P>
<A HREF="#top"> [top]</A>
<HR>
<P>
<B><A NAME="q5b">What now?  Where is the application I just installed?</A></B>
<P>
Basically, we've tried to confine the Skunkware applications
and their associated data files, libraries, and such to
/usr/local. The binary executables get put in /usr/local/bin,
the man pages in /usr/local/man, the libraries in /usr/local/lib,
the header files in /usr/local/include, and so on (with some exceptions).
<P>
So, to be able to execute something like, say, gzip, you would
either need to :
<PRE>
    $ /usr/local/bin/gzip ...
</PRE>
or, preferably :
<PRE>
    $ PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
    $ export PATH
    $ gzip ...
</PRE>
You can add /usr/local/bin to your shell PATH variable by
editing your $HOME/.profile (this variable is called path
for csh users and can be set in the $HOME/.login).
<P>
For Bourne and Korn shell users (sh and ksh), add the following
lines to your .profile :
<PRE>
    PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
    export PATH
</PRE>
For C-shell users (csh), add the following to your .login :
<PRE>
    set path = ($path $home/bin /usr/local/bin .)
</PRE>
You can also add /usr/local/man to your MANPATH variable in a
similar manner.
<P>
After setting up your PATH (and MANPATH) as described above,
you can then execute binaries that live in /usr/local/bin by
just typing their name (e.g. gzip). If you setup your MANPATH
as well, you can read man pages that live in /usr/local/man
by simply typing "man command" where "command" is a command
like gzip or whatever.

<B><A NAME="gcc">Can i use GCC without the SCO Development System?</A></B>
<P>
The GCC package for OpenServer requires system libraries and headers.   
Even if you do not have a licensed SCO development system, you are 
licensed to use these at no cost and they are available on your 
installation media. Install them thusly:
<UL>
<LI>    Invoke custom

<LI>    Select "Install New" option from the "Software" menu. 

<LI>    Follow the prompts to steer custom toward the original media you used 
        to install OpenServer 5. 

<LI>    Select Application Development Libraries and Linker. Install it all. 
        This will give you the libraries, headers, and man pages.

<B><A NAME="q5d">Is Skunkware Y2K compliant?</A></B>
<P>
The SCO Skunkware components are officially unsupported.
As such, there is no SCO Y2K warranty on any of the Skunkware
components. This is changing as some of these packages move
from Skunkware into the standard product.
<P>
Any Y2K compliance statements for Skunkware components would
be issued by the maintainers of that package. For instance, see 
<A HREF=http://www.apache.org/foundation/Y2K.html>
http://www.apache.org/foundation/Y2K.html</A> for a statement
on the Apache web server Y2K compliance.
<P>
You will have to do something like this with each of the
Skunkware components you wish to "warranty" against Y2K compliance.
I use the Skunkware web site as a navigational aid in finding
the home page of various Skunkware packages. For instance, if you
wanted to know about Y2K and Python, you could go to skunkware.ddns.net/skunkware,
click on Interpreters, click on Python and go to the Python home
page at www.python.org. There, you would find a typical Y2K statement
along the lines of "There are no known Y2K problems ... We think Pyton
is Y2K compliant ... If there's a problem, we will fix it".
<P>
We've found the Open Source developer community quite adept at identifying 
and fixing problems rapidly. This model functions well only with an active
participatory user community. If you find a Y2K problem with any Skunkware
component, please e-mail an in-depth description of that problem to
skunkware@ronrecord.com and we will work with the package maintainers to remedy
the problem as soon as possible.

<B><A NAME="q10">Can I charge money for SCO Skunkware?</A></B>
<P>
The answer depends on the license terms of the Skunkware components.
The owners of some components do not permit commercial resale, so
you cannot charge for copying those components, and therefore you
cannot sell or resell the Skunkware CD.
<P>
However, most components, including all components licensed under
the GNU General Public License (GPL), do not prohibit you from
copying, modifying and/or reselling those components, for any
price you want.
<P>
See the individual COPYING, LICENSE or README files for a component for
specifics with regard to licensing and redistribution of that component.

<A NAME="q11">Which Skunkware components are intended for platform XYZ?</A></B>
<P>
The Skunkware team has tried to clearly divide the Skunkware components into
packages intended for specific SCO operating environments. The top-level
Skunkware directory (on the CD-ROM, ftp site and web site) has subdirectories
named :
<DL>
<DT>osr5 
<DD>this directory contains software for SCO OpenServer 5
<DT>uw2 
<DD>this directory contains software for SCO UnixWare 2.x
<DT>uw7 
<DD>this directory contains software for the SVR5 based SCO UnixWare 7
</DL>
Most of the software intended for SCO UnixWare 2.x will install and run
perfectly well on the SVR5 based UnixWare 7. The OpenServer Skunkware packages
should also run on the SVR5 based UnixWare 7 but have not yet been tested
in this environment.

<A NAME="q12">Where can I find audio tools for use with my SCO system?</A></B>
<P>
You can download the latest players and drivers and such at
<A HREF="/skunkware/audiovis/index.html">
http://skunkware.ddns.net/skunkware/audiovis/index.html</A>
<P>
In particular, the Open Sound System audio drivers for SoundBlaster compatible cards
are available at
<A HREF="/skunkware/osr5/audio/oss/">
http://skunkware.ddns.net/skunkware/osr5/audio/oss/</A> for SCO OpenServer and
<A HREF="/skunkware/uw2/audio/oss/">
http://skunkware.ddns.net/skunkware/uw2/audio/oss/</A> for SCO UnixWare.
<P>
Another good source for audio tools is 4Front Technologies at
<A HREF="http://www.4front-tech.com/ossapps.html">
http://www.4front-tech.com/ossapps.html</A>
<P>
Finally, one of the applications we tested with the Linux emulator,
lxrun, was the Linux RealAudio player. So, an additional
reservoir of audio tools resides in the Linux audio applications
in conjunction with lxrun on SCO OpenServer. The download area
for lxrun is :

<A NAME="q12b">I'm having a problem playing audio.</A></B>
<P>
If you are using the Open Sound System audio driver included with Skunkware 97, check
/usr/lib/oss/soundon.log to make sure everything got initialized properly.
A common problem is simply not having run the "soundon" utility. On my
system i have created a startup script /etc/rc2.d/S95soundon containing :
<PRE>
case "$1" in
start)
    /usr/lib/oss/soundon
    ;;
stop)
    /usr/lib/oss/soundoff
    ;;
*)
    exit 1
esac
</PRE>
You can also check /usr/lib/oss/install.log to see if there were any
errors during installation.
<P>
For a list of device nodes and their major and minor numbers,
take a look in /usr/lib/oss/modules/sndb/Node.  You can create any
missing device nodes with the /etc/mknod command.
<P>
If this still doesn't work, you might try using "trace" on play_snd
to try and see exactly what device node it is trying to open.
<P>
If you are completely stumped, e-mail <A HREF="mailto:skunkware@ronrecord.com">
skunkware@ronrecord.com</A> with a problem report and the contents of the
above mentioned log files.

<A NAME="q12c">Are the free Open Sound System audio drivers crippled?</A></B>
<P>
The reason 4Front is still charging $40 for copies of the driver
is that they are selling the non-SoundBlaster drivers.  SCO only
licensed the drivers for true SB and 100%-compatible cards.
<P>
Note that there are some cards that call themselves "SoundBlaster
compatible" but aren't.  These cards have an 8-bit SB-lookalike
mode, but it takes special instructions to put the card in SB
compatability mode.  These cards are not supported by the drivers
SCO licensed, but are supported by other drivers from 4Front.
<P>
Also, some of the more advanced SB cards (like the AWE64) come
with an Emu8000 synthesis chip.  These also require a special
driver from 4Front.
<P>
The drivers that SCO licensed for inclusion in the OS (and that
were on Skunkware) will do the following:
<UL>
    <LI> DSP synthesis and sampling at 8 or 16 bit depths (used for
      playing and recording .wav, .au, .mp3, etc.)

    <LI> OPL3 MIDI synthesis (used when the card generates its "own"
      wave forms).  This is replaced with the Emu chip on the more
      expensive SB cards.

    <LI> MIDI signal generation (through the joystick port, to drive
      external synthesizers)

    <LI> Mixer control (for changing relative levels of various devices,
      recording source, balance, equalization, etc.)

    <LI> Activation of Plug & Play devices.  I won't go into exactly
      how PnP works, but an unactivated card is unusable by the
      system, and an activated card looks just like a generic
      (non-PnP) SB card.  The activation can be carried out either
      by a driver or by the Plug & Play BIOS (if present on the
      motherboard).
</UL>
Each of the above bullets corresponds to a separate driver.  (If
you have an OSR5 system with the 4Front drivers from Skunkware
installed, you can look in /usr/lib/oss/modules and see the
individual drivers.)
<P>
Anyway, there's no such thing as a driver that's crippled so
that "PnP cards don't work".  Even with the old Voxware drivers,
you can use a PnP sound card if you have a Plug & Play BIOS
to activate the card.

<P>
This can very likely be remedied by installing the Graphics Libraries
package for your platform.
<P>For SCO OpenServer, this package is available
at <A HREF="/skunkware/osr5/libraries/Glib/">
http://skunkware.ddns.net/skunkware/osr5/libraries/Glib/</A>. 
If you have the Skunkware 98 CD-ROM, you can install this component (as root)
by cd'ing to <mount-point>/osr5/lib/Glib and running the shell script
"./Install". This script just runs the command :
<PRE>
custom -p SKUNK98:Glib -i -z `pwd`/archives/TAPE
</PRE>
<P>
For SCO UnixWare,
there are several individual packages available in the subdirectories at
<A HREF="/skunkware/uw2/libraries/">
http://skunkware.ddns.net/skunkware/uw2/libraries/</A>.
If you have the Skunkware 98 CD-ROM, you can install individual components
of the Graphics Libraries package (as root) by cd'ing to
<mount-point>/uw2/lib and running the pkgadd program on the appropriate
pkg file(s) in the subdirectories there.
<P>
The programs that use these libraries were built to look in /usr/local/lib
for the necessary files. It is possible that a program was built incorrectly.
If you already have the Graphics Libraries installed and are still getting
an error message like this, you may need to create symbolic links from the
appropriate libxyz.so in /usr/local/lib to /usr/lib. If this is the case,
please e-mail <A HREF="mailto:skunkware@ronrecord.com">skunkware@ronrecord.com</A>
