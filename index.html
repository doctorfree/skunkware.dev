## Introduction From the [Wikipedia article on SCO
Skunkware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO_Skunkware): > SCO Skunkware, often
referred to as simply "Skunkware", is a collection of > open-source software
projects ported, compiled, and packaged for free > redistribution on SCO
operating environments. SCO Skunkware packaged > components exist for SCO Xenix,
SCO UNIX, SCO OpenServer 5, SCO OpenServer 6, > UnixWare 2, Caldera OpenLinux,
Open UNIX 8, and UnixWare 7. SCO Skunkware was > an early pioneering effort to
bring open source software into the realm of > business computing and, as such,
provided an important initial impetus to the > acceptance and adoption of open
source software in the small and medium > business market. An extensive SCO
Skunkware download area has been maintained > since 1993 and SCO Skunkware
components were shipped with operating system > distributions as far back as
1983 when Xenix for the IBM XT was released by > The Santa Cruz Operation. The
annual SCO Forum conference was a venue for the > makers and users of SCO
Skunkware to meet and discuss its contents and ideas > for future additions. > >
Later additional open source distributions for operating platforms such as > the
FreeBSD Ports collection and the Solaris Freeware repository would lend >
additional momentum to the adoption of open source in the business community. ##
