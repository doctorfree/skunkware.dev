  <strong>
    This site attempts to re-introduce the visitor to SCO Skunkware and
    reconstruct portions of the Skunkware website. Please note that links to
    downloadable packaged Skunkware software are no longer active and those
    packages no longer maintained. This site offers solely historical curiosity
    and wistful nostalgia.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
  These archives are largely the exact same documents preserved over the decades
  by fastidious Skunkware fans and horders. Essentially, you will be entering
  the 90s or early 2000's. The interwebs have changed a lot since then with
  people and organizations moving their websites, changing their email
  addresses, and generally acting like the 90s weren't perfect. As such, many of
  the links in these archives are stale, non-existent, or have been turned into
  porn sites. But, most of them just reference the Skunkware website which I
  have tried to preserve so browsing is still fun but occassionally interrupted
  with a 404.

    <strong>
      SCO Skunkware, often referred to as simply “Skunkware”, is a collection of
      open-source software projects ported, compiled, and packaged for free
      redistribution on SCO operating environments. SCO Skunkware packaged
      components exist for SCO Xenix, SCO UNIX, SCO OpenServer 5, SCO OpenServer
      6, UnixWare 2, Caldera OpenLinux, Open UNIX 8, and UnixWare 7. SCO
      Skunkware was an early pioneering effort to bring open source software
      into the realm of business computing and, as such, provided an important
      initial impetus to the acceptance and adoption of open source software in
      the small and medium business market. An extensive SCO Skunkware download
      area has been maintained since 1993 and SCO Skunkware components were
      shipped with operating system distributions as far back as 1983 when Xenix
      for the IBM XT was released by The Santa Cruz Operation. The annual SCO
      Forum conference was a venue for the makers and users of SCO Skunkware to
      meet and discuss its contents and ideas for future additions. Later
      additional open source distributions for operating platforms such as the
      FreeBSD Ports collection and the Solaris Freeware repository would lend
      additional momentum to the adoption of open source in the business
      community.

  The term 'Skunkware' was coined by Dion Johnson as homage to the many
  'Skunkworks' that sprung up at places like NASA and Lockheed. These were
  unofficial, off-the-books, sometimes secret projects that engineers would
  conduct, often leading to remarkable breakthroughs and discoveries due to the
  unsupervised freedom they enjoyed.
</p>
<p>
  Everett Rogers defined Skunkworks as an "enriched environment that is intended
  to help a small group of individuals design a new idea by escaping routine
  organizational procedures." The term originated during World War II when the
  P-80 Shooting Star was designed by Lockheed's Advanced Development Projects
  Division in Burbank, California. A closely guarded incubator was set up in a
  circus tent next to a plastics factory in Burbank. The strong smells that
  wafted into the tent made the Lockheed R&amp;D workers think of the
  foul-smelling "Skonk Works" factory in Al Capp's Li'l Abner comic strip.

<p>Skunkware is a Skunkworks for Software.</p>

  Why is Skunkware Historically Important
</h2>
<p>
  The 90s releases of SCO Skunkware were on a mountable CD-ROM which contained
  an HTTP server and HTML documents with links to SCO Custom+ installable
  packages.
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"

    NCSA Mosaic</a
  >
  had been licensed by SCO shortly after its first release in 1993 and was used
  by Skunkware as the primary interface to browse the mounted CD-ROM. The CD
  also contained a Custom+ installable Skunkware SSO which installed the
  Skunkware website in `/usr/local` on the system along with the HTTPD server
  which could then be used to run a Skunkware website from your system.
</p>
<p>
  In those days the Web was just getting started in the medium and small
  business sectors, SCO's primary market. Further SCO controlled over 80&percnt;
  of the Unix on Intel market. Most medium and small businesses, if they had a
  computer, had one of the commodity off-the-shelf "inexpensive" personal
  computers that IBM had popularized. Much of that market was running an SCO
  operating system. SCO had the first licensed distribution of a web browser
  bundled with the operating system and that system came with a CD-ROM you could
  use to easily create a website and get on the Web - using Skunkware.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to facilitating medium and small business entry to the Internet,
  Skunkware introduced this sector to open source software. The primary function
  of Skunkware was to deliver precompiled, preconfigured, packaged software
  components that were easy to install and use. These were all freely
  distributable open source software the Skunkware team had worked on and
  provided free of charge. Even though, at that time, the GNU Project had been
  around for a decade, it didn't have a kernel so it was incomplete with no
  operating system. Linux had just been released in 1991 and by 1994 still had
  very little market share other than hobbyists. SCO distributed a proprietary
  operating system but embraced open standards and incorporated many open source
  projects in their products. SCO Skunkware augmented SCO operating systems with
  hundreds of open source projects including an environment tailored for open
  source development.
</p>
<p>
  In this way, Skunkware served as a significant influence in popularizing open
  source software in the business community and providing that community with
  tools to leverage the burgeoning power of open source and the Internet.
