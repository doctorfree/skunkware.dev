SCO Skunkware 2000 contains packages suitable for installation on 
SCO OpenServer 5 systems with the SCO Software Manager (/etc/custom).
<P>
SCO Skunkware 2000 is both an installation media recognizable by custom
and a mountable filesystem. In the text that follows, the string
<I>mount-point</I> will refer to the full pathname of the CD-ROM mount point
(for example, you may choose to mount the CD-ROM on /usr/skunkware in which
case <I>mount-point</I> would refer to /usr/skunkware).
<P>
<B>Installation on SCO OpenServer 5</B>
<P>
The following is repeated in the Skunkware 2000 release notes in the section
"<A HREF="relnotes.html#installing">Installing the Skunkware 2000 Software</A>".
<P>
To install the SCO Skunkware 2000 software, mount the CDROM and run the
INSTALL program:
<PRE>
   # mount -r /dev/cd0 /&lt;mount-point&gt;
   # /&lt;mount-point&gt;/INSTALL
</PRE>
This is the recommended Skunkware 2000 installation procedure.
The INSTALL program will detect which platform you are installing on,
(possibly) ask some questions and install all the available packaged files 
for that platform.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The installation of all the Skunkware 2000 components requires several hundred
Megabytes of free space on the partition used by /opt/K/SKUNK2000.
<P>
On SCO OpenServer, the custom installed Skunkware 2000 files will reside
in /opt/K/SKUNK2000. Therefore to install these in an alternate filesystem,
<PRE>
   # mkdir /u/SKUNK2000
   # ln -s /opt/K/SKUNK2000 /u/SKUNK2000
</PRE>
Setting the appropriate symbolic link up prior to installing Skunkware 2000
can avoid potential serious problems with consuming the root filesystem
free disk space and/or inodes.
<P>
Further platform-specific installation instructions are available in the 
<A HREF="relnotes.html">Skunkware 2000 Release Notes</A>:
<P>
After completing the installation of the Skunkware 2000 components you desire,
you may wish to add /usr/local/bin to your PATH and /usr/local/man to your
MANPATH. You may also wish to add /usr/local/java to your CLASSPATH. It should
not be necessary to add /usr/local/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH as the
Skunkware 2000 shared libraries have been built with the appropriate flags.
<P>
To query the system about installed Skunkware 2000 packages, issue the command:
<PRE>
   # /etc/custom -p SKUNK2000:default -l
</PRE>
<P>
You can also install components graphically by simply invoking the
SCO Software Manager:
<PRE>
   # /etc/custom
	 (select the CD-ROM device)
</PRE>
<P>
To install an individual package, execute the command:
<PRE>
   # /etc/custom -p SKUNK2000:default:package_name -i -m /dev/rcd0
</PRE>
        where "package_name" is the name of the desired component.
  <P>      
For a list of all the custom installable components see the file 
<A HREF="COMPONENTS.html">COMPONENTS.html</A>.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
This cdrom is built as a mountable filesystem, and may be mounted
to view, use, or install.  To mount the cdrom, use the mount(ADM)
command with the mount point of your choice.
<BR>
OpenServer :
<PRE>
    # mount -r /dev/cd0 /<I>mount-point</I>
</PRE>
    or
<BR>
UnixWare :
<PRE>
    # mount -r -f cdfs /dev/cdrom/cdrom1 /<I>mount-point</I>
</PRE>
